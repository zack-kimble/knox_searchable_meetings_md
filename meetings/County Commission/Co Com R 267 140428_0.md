| 0:01:33| Madam Clerk, first item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| Consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| Texas Valley Mini Mart, 8920 Maynardville Pike, NYSAR LLC owner, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=99)|
| 0:01:52| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Would you state your name for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| My name is Kareem Boghani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Boghani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| The procedure here today is that we will hear the facts of your case that will be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| before this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| You will have an opportunity to hear those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| You'll have an opportunity to ask questions of your own, to make a statement before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| board, and to settle the matter with this particular beer board, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| At this time, you have charges that are placed against you, and I would like to call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| Sheriff's Department to give this board those charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| Captain May, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| Alan Wolfie May, North Scott County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| On March 13, 2014, I conducted an underage beer sting at the Texas Valley Mini Mart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=162)|
| 0:02:50| 8920 Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Purchased a six-pack of Red's Apple Ale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=172)|
| 0:03:01| Okay, you've heard the allegations from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| Do you admit or deny these allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| They're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| We admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Do you have any testimony or anything that you would like to say or give before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| body, before they examine your case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| Basically, of course, after we got busted, we've taken some actions to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| that doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| What used to happen is the register that we have, the cashiers could bypass the birth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=208)|
| 0:03:36| where it asks to punch in the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| They could bypass that date of birth, but after this incident, we've reprogrammed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| to where they cannot bypass that particular function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| When they check the ID, they have to physically punch in the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| So if it's under 21, the transaction won't go any further, so hopefully incidents like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| this won't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| And I've got some tickets after that day, which, you know, there's some date of birth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| so it's 1969, 67, just to make it a point that we check everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| It doesn't matter how old they look, you know, we check their ID, punch in the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| of birth, and if it's over 21, then only the transaction goes further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Besides that, you know, Charles, who works for us, you know, who apparently had this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| transaction, he appeared in the court, and the court had actually given him a probation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| for six months, and we actually scheduled his task training, which is this month, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| he goes to Knox County Police Department and gets a training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| You know, it's like a four-hour training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| So, you know, we are making sure that this won't happen again, you know, and we do apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| that this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| All right, is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Well, we need a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| Before I can ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| No, go ahead and ask your question, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| My first question, I guess, would be for Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| This is a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| When was the first one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| April of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Of 11, April 11, so it's been almost three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Sir, were you the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| I've got one other thing I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| The clerk that evening was very upset with me when I asked for his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| He actually slung his driver's license from about me to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| So he wasn't very happy with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| How long have you had this establishment, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| Actually, that establishment, right when we got the billboard meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| that's when we had that first thing operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| And after that, you know, there have been some more thing operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| which I've got another letter from the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| that we did not sell beer to the underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| And, you know, this is congratulating us that we did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Apparently, you know, not this time, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Were you the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| At that time, we were the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| The last time also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Then why would you not have programmed your registers to not take anything but the correct ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=386)|
| 0:06:35| Why did you wait until after the second time to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Sir, it was programmed at that time, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| But, see, at that time, it was not programmed in such a way that they couldn't bypass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| You know, it was programmed to where they punch in the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| But, you know, apparently they could bypass it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| So it was like when you ring up a six-pack or a pack of beer, it asks for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| If you just hit enter, the transaction moves further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| But now we programmed it in such a way that even after they scan it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| they have to punch in the ID that's on there, or else it won't move any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| And one more thing I'd like to mention is, you know, the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| I understand that, you know, this might happen, too, that, you know, he looks at the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| and he might punch in the wrong ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| You know, if it's our bad luck, if the cashier is pissed off like he was the other day maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| he might just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| So what we've done is we've ordered another machine in which, you know, we don't have it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| We've done ordered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| So in that machine, what it does is you just scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| If it says okay, you sell it, or else you don't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| So we've ordered that machine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| But right now, until we get that machine, this is the precaution that we are taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| and, you know, and he's going to go to the training, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| But you said you've ordered a new machine that scans it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| If they give you a fake ID, it's going to scan it and come out okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| So you're going to have to have a double check on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| No, actually, that machine will catch the fake IDs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| How's it going to tell a fake ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| It's got a – it reads the barcode on it, so we know where – I guess you could go over here on the strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=494)|
| 0:08:23| and get an ID from at least 48 of the 50 states in the union right now for any date of birth you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| I don't know if this is germane to the – I mean, fake IDs are – that's not going to be his responsibility as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| No, but that machine does check fake IDs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| The barcode's got to match the front, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| That's how they catch them, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| Do you have any other –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| No, I just – it disturbs me if you get caught once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| then you should be taking all the precautions that you can to not have to come back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| Commissioner Orloby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| I'm upset that this is the second offense but three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| That's a big gap, and I can understand almost that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| The thing that really bothers me is the way he would lose his temper and just throw his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=551)|
| 0:09:19| That's very disrespectful to him as an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| What – besides going to court, what did you all do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| Was there a suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Was there what happened to him other than nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| See, it would – if it makes you feel good, I would just tell you that I fired him the next day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| but I did not because we're all humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| He made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Maybe he had a bad day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| But for him to lose his job, he did something that was not right that could jeopardize my business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| So I would be more mad than him, but then again, he's got a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| so I just cannot kick him out and be like, hey, no job anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| But we did warn him that if this happens again, now it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| We will have to let you go if this happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| So now at least hopefully this won't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| I'm not asking for termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| I was not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| If there's no repercussions to what he did, especially being disrespectful to an officer like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| He must have probably thought that now he's going to lose his job because most of the time that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| You sell beer to some underage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| He probably just thought that he'd lose his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| But I didn't know that he was hateful to the officer, and I do apologize for that officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| And we will make sure that when I go back, I'll make sure I take care of that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| But I was not aware of that incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| All right, we need a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Dave, is that yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Mr. Chairman, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| As a second offense, the choice is $1,000 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=683)|

| 0:11:36| When are you going to choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| We would pay the $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=697)|

| 0:12:02| You've seen the procedure before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| We will ask the officer to come and bring the charges against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=724)|

| 0:12:30| On March 13, 2014, conducted an underage beer sting at the Cargo Oil 7025 Maynardville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=750)|
| 0:12:39| and bought a six-pack Bud Light Lime bottles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| You heard the testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Do you admit or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| We agree with the testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| At this time, you have an opportunity to provide any testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| or make any statements before this body before we turn it over for their examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| Well, the violation was inexcusable since it was the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| But we've had some management turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| and the young lady who was the manager had been there about two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| She transferred from our store on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And the city, the only one responsible for tips card is the manager, not employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| This young gentleman that rang up the cashier did not have a tips card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| She was unaware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| But right now, everyone at the store, including the manager, does have a tips card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| It was inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| He got the day and the month correct but got the year wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Our machines are fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| If you punch in a date and it's not correct, the transaction is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| We have no explanation for why they can't get three numbers correctly and put it in the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=831)|
| 0:14:04| It was simply our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=847)|

| 0:14:12| This is the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Do we have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=853)|

| 0:14:19| If the clerks of the businesses, if they'll just look at the driver's license and look at the red stripe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| and it tells them when they're 21, there's no having to punch in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| They can tell just simply by looking at the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| It'll say under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| I say this every board meeting that if they do what they're supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| they don't have to figure math or enter anything or try to read, try to add or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| It's already on the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| I'll go ahead and make a motion then, Mr. Chairman, if it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=893)|

| 0:16:53| We do admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Is there any testimony or evidence you would like to present before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| I would like to make testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| When we were stung this time around, our cashier did actually check the ID, and we actually have it on camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1021)|
| 0:17:09| Actually checked it twice and entered it in the system as well, and I don't know why he entered the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1029)|
| 0:17:17| But, you know, when the sale was made and the officer came inside and, you know, questioned him about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| his story was that the IDs were different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| How true that is, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| However, you know, facts are facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| You know, he must have entered the wrong year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| He says that, you know, the guy turned or the ID said that the person, the undercover officer turned 21 in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| and apparently he said it was January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| But, you know, regardless of the fact, you know, he made the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| You know, he did go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| However, officers were not present from Knox County, so he goes back to court tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| So I don't know what's going to come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| But in any case, you know, we did give him a one-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| He was wrote up by our company, and he's required to go to KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| and take a task class and then provide us with a certificate in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1081)|

| 0:19:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Mr. Heinzman, you've seen the procedure here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| You will bring the officer forward to present the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| You will have an opportunity to admit or deny the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| You'll have an opportunity to bring testimony to your own defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| and then before the board deliberates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| At this time, I'll call Captain Wolfie May, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| On March 13, 2014, conducted underage beer staying at the bread box 7100 Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| purchased six-pack Bud Light platinum bottles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| Do you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| We admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Do you have any testimony you'd like to give before this board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Well, it's just basically similar to all the previous testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| We have the system in place to enter the date in the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| It cannot be bypassed, and apparently the clerk entered the wrong date in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| And per our company policy, it was terminated immediately under our no-tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| Wolfie, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Are you a regional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| I'm a district manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Okay, because I've seen you on other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| The actual district manager is on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| I'm just taking your place, but I do have four stores here in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| I thought that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| You know, this is just a general kind of comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| I'm kind of like Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| It doesn't impress me that you immediately fire someone, and I understand you've got a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| but I will say you as a district or regional manager need to reevaluate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| because what you're trying to do, I mean, you know, kind of the whole death penalty argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| I've seen you here before, so zero policies, you know, zero tolerance sometimes works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| most times I think doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| But, you know, to me I would rather you deal with the situation, deal with the employee in a way that they're reformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1293)|
| 0:21:44| as opposed to just kind of doing away with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| And I know jobs are scarce and you can go out and hire someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| but, you know, that person, they're getting paid, but they also have a commitment to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| So I just ask that you guys consider not a zero tolerance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| but let's look at the situation and see if that person is salvageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| If not, take them out, hire out, and, you know, shoot them out back, whatever, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| But I think that, you know, jobs are hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| Jobs are hard to come by, and some people can be reformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| So that's just a general statement to you and your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| This being the first offense, I move a $500 fine for a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| All right, we have a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| We'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Seven days by the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Where can I get the address to mail that to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1370)|

| 0:30:22| At this time, I'll turn it over to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| Wolfie, when is the court date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Does he have a court date for that, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I'll make a motion that we suspend this until after his court proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| I guess the question to the Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| what can we do at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| I mean, can we take action to something that hadn't been adjudicated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Currently, this board, of course, has the pleasure to do anything it wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| and the candidate, based upon your ruling, if you suspend or deny or refute at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| and in all respects they are eligible for a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| then they have the right to appeal through circuit or chance record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| And then that ruling, of course, could go through the process of appeal on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| As the law stands right now, it would not be proper to deny a candidate a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| until they have actually been convicted of a felony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| or any conviction related to beer, as I asked the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| So the answer to your question is this board can do whatever it wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| and the candidate has legal options, but our defense would be very weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| Sam, that's why I said just postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| I didn't say deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I just said postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Well, I think something a little better, in my mind, a little cleaner, I mean, could we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| and again I'll address this to the Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| could we approve the permit pending safe outcome or, I don't know, maybe laws once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| if he is in fact convicted, then you immediately, that license is immediately revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| Well, even without that option before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| it would be coming before this board on a violation of a felony because of our beer ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| In other words, if the owner of a beer establishment is convicted of a felony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| or anything against the state, our code says that their license will be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| So that's always out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Can we put a caveat in this license that if the applicant is convicted of a felony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| that it's an immediate revocation and Wolfie goes and picks up the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| It's your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Yeah, I'd like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| I'd like to make that a form of substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| Michael, who's going to monitor that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| How's Wolfie going to know when his court date is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| It's in July, and I was told that I wasn't convicted of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| That's why I applied for the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| So it's in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Your court date is in July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| So he's giving you the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Do you actually have a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Do you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| My lawyer is Don Coffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| I can call him right away and get the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| If you would get that to Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| We have a substitute motion to grant the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| and with a caveat if it's a felony conviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| the license are immediately suspended upon that conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Any discussion on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2027)|

| 0:39:49| Mr. Curtis, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| You'll come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| If you'll give your name and address to the record, I'd appreciate it, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| My name is Charles Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| I'm the Executive Director of the County Commissioners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| My address is 700 Capitol Boulevard, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| I just want to take this opportunity to meet with you and let each one of you know that I'm not some dignitary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| somewhere you can't call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| I'm going to leave my cards if I get permission with the clerk and she can get them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| But I've got my cell phone, my home phone, and my office phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| I work for each one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I represent you in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| It's my duty to keep you informed as to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| And by majority vote of my board, that's where I get my directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| But if any of you ever call me with an issue, that issue will stay between you and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| I'm not going to call and say, Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Commissioner McKenzie called and asked me last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| That will stay between Commissioner McKenzie and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| That's the way I try to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| If you call me at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, it's not really going to upset me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| but my wife's going to be mad for days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| So if you've got to have me, call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| But if you can avoid that, I'd certainly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| But the main reason I wanted to be here is just so you know who I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| and feel comfortable calling and talking to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| And I hope and pray you do if you need me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Any discussion, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Thank you, Mr. Curtis, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2479)|

| 0:41:50| I had to take my son some lunch and some money to pay that $4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| The school board is going to have to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| If you people don't want to spend that 63% of your budget on the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| you need to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2522)|

| 0:42:11| Turn it off if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2531)|

| 0:42:31| We had a great turnout Friday at the elementary and the school's track meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| There was no one there to support these kids in suit and ties and dresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Us parents turned it off again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| All the parents showed up for this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| That was a chance for you people to come out and help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Dr. McIntyre's wife came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| She bought some food from the concession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2571)|

| 0:42:56| But where was Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| Where were these school board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| That was a chance for these kids to see that they care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| I got letters that I wrote to the Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2583)|

| 0:43:15| just to see how bad it is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| The school board, I've been talking to teachers all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| I talked to a teacher at the Earth event at World Fair Park Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| This lady said she'd been teaching 31 years in art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| She said she got an evaluation, and last month it was all fives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Two weeks later, a young grad student come to the school and evaluate her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| and she got all ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| She said she'd been doing art all these years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| and it really hurt her to see this young grad student give her all ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| after she just got all fives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| I talked to a teacher Sunday at a birthday party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| and this teacher was telling me these teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| I said, how did school year went?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| He said, it is tiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| I talked to another teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| She said this is the worst year she had in teaching in 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| I talked to another assistant principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| She said she's going to find her a new job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| She said she don't know nothing about the health profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| but that's what she's looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I had teachers tell me they already, over in Fort Knox County in the north area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| this teacher tell me that she's going to try to find her another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| She's been a physical education teacher for over 18 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| and she see that that student loan was not worth it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| that the treatment she's getting now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| that this evaluation process has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| And all these school board members, they refused to return phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I wrote a letter to the Department of Energy commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| He wrote me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| I'm going to write him back again telling him to come and clean up KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| Just run a check on them to see if they're doing things correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| because you guys are not going to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| I went to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Some people just sitting back there with their suit and ties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| and their nice dresses on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| And that's all it comes down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| But I got letters, I got addresses and phone numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| and signatures from people as they're coming out of KUB offices asking them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| hey, let's get something started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I don't know how a petition works, but you can bet I'm going to get everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| addressed that's willing to say KUB needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| And I wrote the president, and I called his office this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| His phone number is 202-456-1111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| Anyone can leave a message that will get to his desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| I called him and invited him to West Hills Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| My daughter would like him to come there to prove that the system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| The only person I got good help from was that guy, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| He talked to me a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| And when he talked to me, and then I talked to a guy, Steve Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| They're probably the best two people I've ever met in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| They return your phone calls, 9, 30, 10, 30, 12 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Me and Mr. Brooks were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| And he invited my daughter to come to Nashville to voice her opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| He said after this election is over, he's going to personally invite her to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| Mr. Pressley, you're running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| All right, we're running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| And then you got seven employees on the school board budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| in a public relations department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| I wanted to do the counting and have that many employees on the public relations level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| So it seemed like, let's clean this place up, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| That's all I'm asking, just a little bit of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Thank you, Mr. Pressley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I have a question for this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Mr. Pressley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Somebody has a question for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| This grad student evaluator, would her name have been Morgan Camu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| The teacher, I didn't want to know the teacher's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I didn't even want to know the evaluator's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| All she told me is the girl was told she's out of grad school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| and they hired her to go around and do evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| And then I was at her event, and this one lady, she was working in the booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| She said, oh, I work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| I'm on the board, and I'm trying to figure out, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| I go around to the outer areas evaluating teachers also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| And once she found out that I was coming here this morning to talk to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| she wouldn't open her mouth no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Well, the reason I'm asking is that this recent study they had the Parthenon people do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| part of that deal was they had to hire a $65,000 grad student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| which is two entry-level teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Now, if she's going around evaluating them at a one whenever they've been getting fives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| then there's something wrong in Denmark somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Well, please help us, then, if you see something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| You should have been here last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2876)|

| 0:48:30| Clerk, can we have that read into the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| while we have Rickey's wife and parents and some friends that are here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| So if you could read that into the record while they're joining us down here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2921)|

| 0:48:57| and a columnist for the Metro Pulse, where he focused on environmental and political matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| and whereas Rickey Hall earned a degree in engineering and humanities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2943)|

| 0:49:12| and thereafter moved to Knoxville to attend graduate school to study ecology at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| whereas Rickey Hall soon became known for his environmentalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| through his writing for the advocacy paper, Tennessee Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| and then for the Hellbender Press, where he championed environmental causes without compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| whereas Rickey Hall was also very involved in the progressive political and environmental scene in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2976)|

| 0:49:49| but his column soon became more political and was eventually relaunched as such by the Metro Pulse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| whereas Rickey Hall will be deeply missed by his family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=2995)|

| 0:50:41| Thank you. I just wanted to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| Rickey and I were friends for many years, and although in the last few years I rarely got to spend much time with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| I always tried to read everything that he wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Regardless of the topic on which he was writing, he was insightful and astute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| and his work was a true joy to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| When I first entered local politics, Rickey was the guru on data and messaging in a campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| and the hand-holding and tutoring that he gave me during those early campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| certainly laid the groundwork for me and made me a better candidate in future races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| And Rickey was also so funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| He had a wicked and often blunt sense of humor that I found delightful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| There are so many of us here in Knox County who will truly and deeply miss Rickey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| and it seems to me that Knoxville just isn't quite as bright a place as it was before he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| So I want to say farewell to Rickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I know you're in the rocks and trees, the birds, animals, and insects that are all around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| and that you love so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3107)|

| 0:56:51| I told Andy about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| We wish you well in your retirement, but just thank you on behalf of the citizens of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Would anyone else want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Thanks very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| This was a real surprise for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| I noticed on my calendar today that I was supposed to come to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| meeting, and so I said to my assistant, I said, you know, what's that about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| She said, I don't know, Houston put it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| So then once he said, well, I don't know, Commissioner Hammond said he wanted you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Once he said that, then I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| But I want to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| I've been doing this a long time, just like a number of you in this room have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| it a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| And Knox County government, since I started working, and I'm a local guy, I've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| been a local guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| I grew up in South Knoxville, Tarklin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Some of you actually know where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| And so I've always wanted to spend my life working in Knoxville, in Knox County, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| And I've been blessed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| But ever since I started trying to raise a little money and provide services to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| who typically had the fewest resources and the most debilitating conditions, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| has always been a partner with the Helen Ross McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| And being from East Tennessee, we've never asked Knox County to do everything, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| that's not the correct way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| But you all have always been willing partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| I've enjoyed working with each and every one of you, and you'll still see me around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| So thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| It's a special day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| And I would call my wife and just tell her that today's my day, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3509)|
| 0:58:43| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Hi, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Salvation Army's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3527)|

| 0:58:50| Oh, are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Salvation Army folks here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Resolution 103 is honoring the Salvation Army for 115 years of service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Do we have a first and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3546)|

| 0:59:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Could we have this read in the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| This is one I didn't want to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Whereas, since the founding in London, England in 1865, the Salvation Army, which is motivated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| by a love for God and concern for the needs of all humanity, has provided altruistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| humanitarian, and spiritual help to people around the world, and continues their compassionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| tradition of helping wherever there is hunger, destitution, and spiritual need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| Whereas, the Salvation Army plays a critical role in response to disaster, domestically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| and globally, including being the first on the scene in Tacloban, the Philippines, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| other devastated areas in the Visayas Island after Typhoon Haiyan, and responding compassionately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| and practically to tornadoes in Moore, Oklahoma, the crippling winter storms of 2013 and 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| and the ongoing recovery of the Northeast following Hurricane Sandy and other domestic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Whereas, in February of 1899, the success of the work of the Salvation Army has spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| to the Knoxville area where Captain and Mrs. Levin Grimshaw unfurled the flag of the Salvation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| Army at 729 Lamar Street and began meeting physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| the people of Knoxville and the surrounding communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| And, whereas, the Salvation Army of Knoxville has served together with Knox County, its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| businesses, organizational partners, and generous donors for 115 years in attempting to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| and end homelessness, combat addiction, and abuse, provide comfort to the lonely and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| devastated, and offer soup, soap, and salvation to the community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| Whereas, today, the Salvation Army is located at 409 North Broadway and offers a safe haven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| for women and children escaping domestic violence situations and provides Christmas toys and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| food to thousands of those who have very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| And, whereas, the Salvation Army offers transitional housing for men and women where residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| find employment and set goals, a career center designed to equip, empower, and educate residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| to become self-sufficient members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| And, whereas, the Salvation Army also serves food, offers emergency and utility assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| travelers aid, and partners with other non-profit organizations in doing the most good with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| the resources that have been entrusted to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows, the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| of Knox County, Tennessee, on behalf of the citizens of Knox County, hereby honors the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| Salvation Army upon the occasion of its 115th year of service to the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| and our surrounding communities and wishes the organization continued success in its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| mission of service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Commissioner Hamm, before you go, I just want to make a quick comment about the Salvation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Thank you for what you do for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Thank you for the great facility that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| I remember before you had that, I mean, you have really stepped up and it looks really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| I personally have rung the bell for over 25 years every Christmas and I think Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| Brown may have done the same thing with Live Thunder Riders and normally we're the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| bell ringers every year for your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| We take pride in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| So, thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Commissioner Hamm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| There have been times on commission when Commissioner Smith wanted to ring my bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| So, I understand now where he gets that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| You heard some of the things, the great things that Salvation Army has done in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| They've been here for 115 years and when we went to the 115 year celebration, it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| occurred to me what would Knoxville be like without the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| I don't even want to go there, don't even want to think about it because they have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| so much over the 115 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| So, Commissioner Burles wanted to co-sponsor this and Amy, I know that they're in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| I just wanted to express my gratitude for the services that they provide and the presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| that they have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| They're good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| They help alleviate some of the stress in the surrounding areas with our homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| and they do great work and I'm so grateful that we have them here in Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| that they do the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| I know that our district would be a much more difficult place without the presence of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| Salvation Army there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| So, thank you so much for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| Commissioners, on behalf of the board, my name is Andrew Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| I'm on the board of the Salvation Army and we humbly accept this recognition for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3845)|
| 1:04:14| 115 years that the Salvation Army has been present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| I know we were talking just a moment ago about bell ringing and I think everybody, when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| think about the Salvation Army, they think about bell ringing and certainly that holds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| a special place in my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| I try every year for the last three years, I think, I've taken my two young daughters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| with me to ring the bells and we typically will go later in the evening towards the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| when it's cold and it's dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| I do that on purpose because, I think it was two years ago, my oldest daughter, Kylie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| had said, why are we out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| I don't want to be out here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| It's cold and it's wet and it's not fun and I want to have something to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| I said to her, we're out here because when we leave, we are going home where it's warm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| and we're going home where we have food and you have a nice bed to sleep in because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3907)|

| 1:06:09| Let me tell you what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| We have the men and the women representing us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| This isn't exactly what we had intended and planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| Maybe so much on the women though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| We can always depend on the women for what they're going to do and how they help us in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| But we just wanted to take the time and speak to the coaches and of course to the players| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| and what it means to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| And so that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| And a lot has happened on the men's side within the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| But there's still a lot of room to rejoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| We want to talk about that and just let the student athletes know that we are behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| and the coaches were behind them, men and the women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| And you make a huge impact in Knox County for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| So if you would read, start with the women please and read that into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4016)|

| 1:07:08| I think it's appropriate that you pass that and say a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| And then we'll speak about the men next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4032)|

| 1:08:58| Whereas the Lady Vols benefited greatly from the basketball expertise and leadership of head coach Holly Warlick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4138)|

| 1:10:13| and we'll go ahead and get these both knocked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4213)|

| 1:10:22| Go ahead Commissioner Hamill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| I could talk all day about the University of Tennessee athletics and particularly the Lady Vols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| but let me just say that in the late 80's I learned that there was an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| to become the public address announcer for the Lady Vols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| And so I called Joan Cronin at the time and said I'd like to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| She said okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| She called me back about a week or so later and she said you're the only one who has applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| so if you want the job it's yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Now this was during the days of Stokely and so we got to do a few games at Stokely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| and then of course moved over to Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| And it has been quite an opportunity for me because I've got the best seat in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| I mean I get to sit there and I get to see all the games and you know do all of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| that help make the University of Tennessee women's basketball what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| It's only a very small part because you look at Coach Pat Summitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| If it wasn't for Coach Summitt women's basketball I think nationally wouldn't be where it is today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| because of her influence, because of her passion for the sport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| and we are extremely lucky that we had her all of those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| and that she took women's basketball to another level not only here but nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| And Donna Thomas is here and under her leadership and all of the leadership of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| of the women's athletics department it has been a joy for me to be associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| I actually have a championship ring that Coach Summitt gave me and I wear it proudly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| because when I look at it it reminds me of excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| And I know that that's what she stood for was excellence in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| So I have seen some great games. I've seen some of the greatest athletes in the world perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4302)|

| 1:11:52| And so Donna it's an honor for me to present this to you and to Coach Warlick and her staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4312)|

| 1:14:35| And whereas the Tennessee Vols greatly benefited and appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| the basketball expertise and leadership of head coach Konzo Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| Now therefore be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| as follows, the Commission of Knox County hereby honors and congratulates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| the University of Tennessee men's basketball team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| Coach Konzo Martin and all associated with the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| for capping off a successful 2013-2014 basketball season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| by reaching the prestigious Sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| Has that been voted on, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| And as he said earlier, you know, when this resolution was first crafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| we were in a different situation as far as the coaching goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| And I wish nothing but the best to the new coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| as he assembles his staff and his program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| But this resolution is about Coach Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| and that team that just got through playing Sweet 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| It wasn't perfection, but it was definitely excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| I think excellence was achieved by that staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| by that squad, and more importantly than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| you know, it was great to hear over three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| he finished two years with 20-plus wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| He did so in a very business-like manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| which may or may not appeal to some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| but he put on his hard hat every day and went to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| and he is to be congratulated, and I wish him much success as he moves on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| I didn't have the fortune enough to meet him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| but I'm sure he'll do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| But more importantly than all of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| the achievement of his student-athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| They really were students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| They are students first, and they have shown that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| by their classroom participation, by their achievements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| both in the classroom and outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| So all this, although this situation probably wasn't ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| definitely wasn't ideal and was very unfortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| this was a great year by a great basketball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| and a pretty darn good coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| John, we're going to do this a little different today, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Joe Lee, I need another copy of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| because I need a copy to send to California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| This is about Coach Martin and the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| John, what I'd like for you to do is to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| we want to present this to the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| I want to read this to the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| I want to thank them for what they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| because the chips were down, and it's a tournament sport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| and they peaked at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| And character of Coach Martin is unsurpassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| And we want to send another copy out to California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| and wish him well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| But Joe Lee, if you can get me a copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| because they're sort of packing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| So if we can get that this week, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| Commissioners, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4645)|

| 1:17:34| most importantly, our student-athletes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| on both the men's and women's basketball teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| apologize that they cannot be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| They are going through finals right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| which we hope that they are competing as vigorously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| in the classroom as they are on the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| We thank you and are humbled by this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| and we look forward to continued success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4674)|

| 1:18:39| If we could have this read into the record, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4719)|

| 1:18:45| declared April National Child Abuse Prevention Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| and whereas child abuse is a hidden epidemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4729)|

| 1:18:54| in the United States each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4734)|

| 1:18:59| to child abuse and neglect nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=4739)|

| 1:38:37| that the committee approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| so I'll give you one last shot at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| if anybody needs it. Otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| it's a go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| We have a motion and a second for the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| All in favor say aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| I would just like to say Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| that Ms. Jill over there has spent many hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| on those changes working with Bud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| and David but she's been doing the hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| so they just got the brain and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| they tell her what to put down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| Appreciate you Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5956)|

| 1:39:37| on the Knox County Board of Equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| Before you, you got a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| before the meeting it had some resumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| and some names on it and I'm going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| and make a motion that we add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| Mr. Jerome Salamone to the first item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5993)|

| 1:39:59| for these two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| We have a motion and a second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6002)|
| 1:40:10| Real quick in the bottom of the letter you also got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| they talked about some appointments to some hearing officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| for a month and let us read those because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| they just got approached to us this morning so we'll add that next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| for that. So we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| to add Mr. Jerome Salamone and I hope I'm pronouncing that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| and Mr. John Anderton. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6028)|

| 1:42:04| with the law department and the purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6124)|

| 1:42:57| it's a percentage of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6177)|

| 1:44:13| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Again, this was our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| paid meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Not payment in our pockets, but our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| where we had a paid facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| take us through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| And it was a good ending meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| They paid for, I guess, 12 sessions and it took us a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| We have not met since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| joint retreat that we had in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| So it had been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| and please, Commissioners Wright and Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| please chime in. I think it was overwhelming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| and overwhelming sentiment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| we need to continue this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| That this committee has been a good thing overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| But with that said, two caveats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| One is that we would not meet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| because we've got budget things right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| We're talking about education associated with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| We don't want to necessarily cloud, and I know Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| and Ms. Fugate are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| meetings and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| So we want the budget process to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| So we probably won't set another meeting until July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| I think was the month, with the current committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| Of course, we know after the elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| we'll have at least one new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| commissioner who sits on this committee, and we may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| multiple new board members. A couple of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| are running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| So we will defer to the chair at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| to see how he wants to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| I think it was a general sentiment that there should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| some legacy people on the committee, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| fresh faces and fresh voices are definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| welcome. So that was one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| Another thing we discussed was the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| that the retreat was a retreat. Thumbs up, thumbs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| I think overall, and I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| got this from you all, that we felt that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| having the two chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| set the agenda was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| The fact that it wasn't facilitated was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| There was actually some apprehension on having it facilitated by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| and that it went well overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| I think they learned a lot about the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| that we have to consider, and those things came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| But it was a good look at how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| between Chris and his compadre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| on the school board side, how they broke down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| the budget process and where the money comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| and the fact we're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| donor county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| The whole conversation was good to help us understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| BEP, and we feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| the next retreat, and we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| recommend a next retreat, we should do it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| Maybe November time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| That way, if they give us something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| to chew on, it's not, they're giving it to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| this month and we've got to vote on it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| In November, hopefully they'll give us where they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| from a financial standpoint, where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| Of course, we'll never know the numbers, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| it'll help us make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| come budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| But the majority of the meeting, I think, focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| on conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| and how we converse with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| And I'll start off by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| this issue was brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| by a commissioner, not a school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| And that issue, it wasn't me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| was the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| the tone of the last work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| last Monday became kind of nasty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| and inflammatory and personal toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| the superintendent. Again, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| vehemently disagree with the message, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| that there needs to be a level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| tone and civility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| toward our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| elected, appointed leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| we may have missed the mark last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| We listened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| we agreed to a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| I think all of us agreed to a point, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| at varying points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| And we basically told them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| we can't legislate tone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| and that if someone's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| speak out, we're going to ask, but we will ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| that we do give proper respect and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| do respect to anyone that comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| But in terms of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| there's no policy we can pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| there's nothing we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| to temper that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6564)|
| 1:49:30| I don't know if I want to pause here and discuss that because there was another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| quasi-controversial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Let's discuss that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| maybe, Commissioner Hammond, then I'll come back to the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| Sure, I'll be happy to do that. I was the one that brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| And the reason I brought it up was probably two or three-fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| During the course of the conversation, there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| suggestion about civility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| between the two bodies, and there was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| some comments that were made that perhaps the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| school board had just, quote, kicked the can down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| in terms of a budget increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| that they weren't willing to find the money in their budget, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| they just gave it to us and said, alright, you guys find the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| So, you know, there were some of these comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| were made, and so I brought up the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| having been on commission for a while, and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| gone through a time when we were not very civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| to one another, and where we were not very civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| to other bodies, that I was very sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| And that we're in a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| unique time in that it's budget time, that's usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| when the two bodies have the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| tenseness among one another. We're also doing an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| election cycle. I mean, the stakes are high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| And so, given those two factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| my comments were, I would hope that if I came before the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| board, that I would be asked tough questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| but that I would be treated respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| And I said, it's a two-way street. I said, if you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| come before us, I would hope that we would treat you respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| We're going to ask the tough questions. That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| And during my time on commission, I've asked some pretty tough questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| to some people, and taken some pretty difficult, not difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| but some, I guess, controversial positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| And that's okay. That's what the people have us here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| So, this is not a means of trying to get away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| asking tough questions or anything, but it's just a matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| to both bodies, is to say, as we go through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| over the next two or three months, is to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| that I think our people want us to be civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| toward one another. People come before us, we expect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| to treat us with civility, to treat us respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| We want to treat everybody, whether it's a school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| or a member of the public. And it's the same thing with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| If they have people come before them, they expect them to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| treated, and the people who are speaking expect to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| treated. So, that was the context of my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| It was one of those things where, again, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| very sensitive to this whole notion of the decorum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| of our body and the decorum of our government, because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| again, I've been through some pretty difficult situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| here over the past few years. But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| this was just a thing of saying, hey, let's both bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| just remember civility toward one another, ask the tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| questions, let's really get down to the brass tacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| but let's treat each other respectfully, because I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| believe that that's what our citizens expect from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| So, thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| First off, let me say that I do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| and again, I say I do not apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| for any remark that I made last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| Sometimes when I get excited, I get a little loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| but I do it to get a point across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| I did not meanfully disrespect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| anyone, but I also am still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| waiting for answers on a lot of those questions that I ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| Every time we ask a question, we get beaten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| around the bush and don't get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| So, as long as I'm sitting on this seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| I don't care if you're the mayor, if you're a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| if you're the school board member, the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| whatever position you're in, if I've got a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| I'm going to ask it. I figure that's what the people put me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| in this seat for. So, I do not apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| for what I said last Monday. I meant every word of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| I agree with Mr. McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| and Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| and Mr. Hammond also, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| I think some of the, we have to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| subject of civility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| and some of us were at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| school board meetings where teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| were coming up when they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| in that rebellious mode, dress red and all that stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| and they were coming up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| express themselves at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| microphone and I can remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| the posture. I'm in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| and I'm looking up here at the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| and I was very disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| in sort of the demeanor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| the general demeanor of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| Some individuals in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| were almost, had their backs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| to the people that were speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| They were obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| dismissive in their posture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| and the way that they treated the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| and so sometimes, I mean, there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| leftover, there is some effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| on those of us that are sympathetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Obviously, I'm going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| worked up. I'm going to get worked up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| teachers and I'm going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| some, although I'm going to try to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| civil, I'm going to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| direct my comments towards policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| and not towards the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| There is a certain level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| there is an emotion, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| definitely some emotion that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| and a lot of us are exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| to that because you've talked to teachers too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| That affects you and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| I'm absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| I was right here with Mr. Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| when we had some unbelievable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| commission meetings in terms of the stuff that went on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| with us and so we don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| No, absolutely not, but I would like for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| Dr. McIntyre and for that board to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| that we are absorbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| teacher stuff and it gets reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| in how we make our comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| and it's not intentional to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| blasting anybody personally, but that's the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| I agree and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| your point, if we can keep it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| policy versus person, I think that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| the biggest thing that came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| so thank you, Commissioner Norman, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| That really was the issue. It wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| the fact that you gave us this budget. I'm actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| the one that talked about kicking the can down the road, kicking the can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| over here, so I really don't want you all to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| that any of the four of us are just cream puffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| in there. That wouldn't be a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| But I think it's become a good, healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| debate. Two other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| real quick. Well, one thing quick and one may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| We talked a little bit about per pupil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| spending and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| third district school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| Doug Harris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| sent me something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| that basically talked about, and this is for our edification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| he's a numbers guy so he and I are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| gelling well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| They talked about the per pupil spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| across the state and then some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| larger districts and we're about $200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| a little over $200 under the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| So again, just to get data out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| where as you look at Bristol, we're about $300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| under Bristol, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| $400 a little bit under Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| and significantly under Johnson City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| Davidson County and Memphis City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| And I know all three of those are numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| You can't argue with numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| Statistics, you can do just about all you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| with it, but those are the per pupil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| spending. So we discussed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| somewhat. And then the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| issue, and this was brought up by a school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| was just the whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| that went through to get the physical plan upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| the PPUs. And again, it's in that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| vein of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| how we deal with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| We're all elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| And again, this was news to me, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| the reporter on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| I guess we've asked for an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| of that and they had no problem with the way the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| went. The whole process to get a full audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| they fully agree with, I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| But then I guess afterwards, some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| came out in the media where it was called a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| slush fund, some inflammatory words like, slush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| funding is very inflammatory, if y'all didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| So they felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| underwhelmed by the initial request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| audit and then to come out and blast it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| And I gave the example of the Beck Culture Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| We asked, the budget was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| happening and the bad word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| got out there, they're still in the money, they're still in the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| we've got to do an audit, it didn't pass budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| They weren't still in money, they weren't still in the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| That's page seven, small article, below the fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| So I do agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| if we're asking for things, we need to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| those things go forward and if they come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| bearing fruit, let's dig in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| So that was one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| that was brought up in terms of, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| these hot button issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Hopefully we can temper them and they won't lead to budget mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Because what I don't want is this PPU thing being an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| and we don't deal with it, but by the same token,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| if it's not an issue and it affects our votes on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| prior to getting resolved, then that would be a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| So again, that's how the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| took place. Maybe some more comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| And then I'll be quiet and turn to Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| and Hammond if they have anything else that I may have missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| I think I was one that sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| took a little bit of the conversation on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| what takes place at commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| and probably compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| legislative bodies in the United States like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| the United States Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| or the state of Tennessee legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| where a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| on the one hand say it's all Republican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| but when you turn around and look at the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| and the issues that come before them, sometimes you don't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| there either. But on this side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| we have to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| everything that we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| else we're not doing, as Commissioner Brown would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| what we're sent here by the people of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| we represent, we're sent here to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| and sometimes that's just to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| The main thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| that comes out of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| we have to convey to each other what we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| If I do not have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| for me to disagree, and this was the example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| I used in the joint committee meeting was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| if I cannot disagree with Mr. McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| then somehow we're being short-circuited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| And Sam and I sitting at different corners of the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| both shake our heads yes to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| kind of, the conversation has to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| We're not all going to agree on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| Now then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| how we present that, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| maybe we need to look at how we present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| but I'm not going to talk to anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| about how they present. You present the way you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| That's why you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| The thing that's really before us is that we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| we've got to look at our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| I know we have budget hearings. I want you to review some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| scheduling things that are taking place in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| few weeks as relate to budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| I know this small joint committee wants to meet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| in July and then it will not meet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| until after elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| And I do say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| the discussion of the small joint committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| did look at the fact that maybe we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| be better off if we had a fall retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| but I don't know how we fit that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| The Board of Education has a fall retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| Fall is an important time in Knox County with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| some sporting events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| It's got large holidays in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| People trying to be with friends and family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| so I don't know whether we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| and see it's after the election anyway so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| it will be something to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| at that time. I think the feeling was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| that since there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| new faces, we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| have those new faces sit with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| and eat breakfast with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| and things like that and get to know each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| before we become involved and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| where we're going to disagree with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| if we, the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| if through the chairs of the Board of Education and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| Knox County Commission agree to a date to have a joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| hearing of the budget, if that agreement comes about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| I said I was in 100% support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| It's up to the chairs of those two boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| to make that arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| As I look at the notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| of the things that were said the other night at the joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| committee and as what we've said right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| this evening at this legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| body meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| we didn't talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| specific things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| We just talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| So as Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| said, there will at least be one new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| face on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| Also another thing that was said was there needs to be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| legacy maybe and I support Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| remaining on the committee and if I were to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| on that committee, I would support him still being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| co-chair of that committee. So I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| And aside from that, if anyone has any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| of what you may have heard through the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| or rumor or whatever about that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| nothing else comes to my mind as being significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| If you have a question of me though, please feel free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| to make comment or ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| the item that Commissioner McKenzie raised a while ago about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| statistics of spending per pupil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| I have seen enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| coming out of the statistical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| department across the street not to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| half of what I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| They have some marvelous spend doctors over there and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| can make any figure say what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| it to do. I know for a fact it happens in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| of the schools and some on instant reports and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| I've got a briefcase full of this stuff. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| what I'm talking about. But to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| believe everything that comes out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| there statistic wise, show me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| I want to be shown definite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| This is a discussion item regarding the proposed EAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| system. Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| A little bit of detail or history I guess is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| you remember two or three years ago we were talking about the fact that we were having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| some bad weather here and we needed some type of an emergency alert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| system. We had talked about sirens, found out that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| antiquated system of doing things and as we delved into it we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| found out that there are these systems available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| which utilize email, texting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| land phones, cell phones, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| that have been used effectively in a number of cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| Most recently Louisville signed on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| a similar system to what we have appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| and in Oklahoma for example they had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| similar system and the citizens were notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| 15 minutes before the deadly tornado hit. There's no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| it saved lives. No question. Because people were given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| a 15 minute notice that a deadly tornado was coming, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| So this body appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| monies for an EAS system. The EAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| system is ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| and Mr. Holt is here I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| There is a snag and the snag is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| we're having difficulty from what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| understand in getting someone to stand up and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| I'll be responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| I'm kind of at a point now where we need to get this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| going. We've got deadly tornadoes that could be coming here in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| 48 hours. We've got a system where we could let our citizens know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| and we've kind of gotten bogged down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| What I would like to do Mr. Chairman is for you to set up a meeting and I talked to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| about this earlier today. I want to be involved in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| If you can get the mayor involved, E911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| whoever else needs to be brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| Let's set that meeting through the mayor's office. Let's meet as quickly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| possible. Let's get this snag ironed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| so that we can get this system up and going because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| we're ready. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| I don't know all the nuances of what's going on. I just need to know that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| need to sit down and have a meeting and decide who's going to do what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| So I'm requesting that you do that and that we do that as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| It's ironic. I just got an email from LMU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| or a text message from LMU that they're telling everybody to shelter in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| for a tornado. So it's kind of ironic that we're talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| Hugh, do you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| comment on where we're at or what best practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| County's Purchasing Director. Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| is dead on federal signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| Our contractor, they're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| They need a point of distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| for those type of alerts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| and messages to go out. We basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| need about a half a day testing and a half a day of train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| the trainer and we can pull the trigger and we're off running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| Thank you. We'll get that meeting set up, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| Any other discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| Any other items come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| We'll be on recess until 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| We don't have any honorariums at 4 or 45, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7761)|

| 2:10:38| Mr. Thompson, what do you plan to do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| My name is Aaron Gray with Fulgen McIndoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| and Associates, 10330 Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| Suite 201, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| I'm here on behalf of Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| The plan for this piece of property is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| extend into a Phase 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| the apartments that's next door. So this would just be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| second part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| OK. Why is it being office, then, if it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| This was based on some conversations we had with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| with MPC and since the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| properties are zoned OB and apartments is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| in an OB zone and the existing parcels around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| are also zoned OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| just to not have them all mismatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| You know, we've got mismatches all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| I mean, it ought to be zoned for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| That's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| You've got another one coming up next month. It's going to be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| Can you explain that, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| In the OB zone, they allow residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| according to the guidelines of the RB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| This says O. Is it supposed to be OB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| No. You're looking at the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| OK. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| It says O on both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| And in this case, whether they proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| Brown, on your agenda, it's the third item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| The second one is the third item, not the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| Sorry, it's the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| We had a confusion up here on our agenda. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| Whether or not they develop that particular piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| with apartments, the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7947)|
| 2:12:30| designation would still be appropriate at this location because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| of the adjacent office designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| and I believe the adjacent OB zoning to the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| So either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| the plan designation as well as the upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| rezoning would be appropriate at the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| and allow flexibility to go either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| on the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| It's a different owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| than was the original developer. This gentleman has purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=7977)|

| 2:16:30| And I was thinking we were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| the opening of Dale Muir Drive to this new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| It would be in that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| if it's approved. But if they're not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8199)|

| 2:17:12| has not requested to open the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| And the neighborhood has requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| that it stay closed because it would change the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| of the neighborhood as far as the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| There's a lot of people who like to get out there and walk right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| But it's not something that the developer wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| And I'd just like to hear what the MPC has to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| Our subdivision regulations actually require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| as people develop property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| to stub streets out to adjacent undeveloped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| And for many decades, we did a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| of sticking to those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| And in the 80s and 90s, we veered away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| And as a result, we have excessive traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| on our arterial and collector roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| and less than excessive traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| on our local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| But connectivity has been demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| that we can reduce traffic on our arterials and collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| without giving up any safety factors within neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| It provides alternative ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| in the small chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| that there are closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| at major intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| It provides people options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| And the probability of traffic cutting through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| is much less than the possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| And street systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| that are highly connected handle much more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| than street systems that are made up of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| So planners encourage connectivity every chance we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| One, because it's consistent with our subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| And two, because it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| Are you here for my deal, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| Can we get your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| David Campbell, 325 Wooded Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| Yeah, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| Can we get a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| Nobody freak out or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| We need to get a motion on the floor to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| I'd like to make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| the zoning as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| but that we keep the street closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| Yeah, really, I had the question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| I'm not trying to sell houses or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| that's a concern of yours, and my understanding was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| is that you did not request that the road open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| We were not on the fence one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| The neighbors expressed their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| We did not have trouble accommodating their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| Well, I would just say I'd ask the commission that we keep the road closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| You know, we hear so often from the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| when we open these roads that there indeed is traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| that cuts through, it changes what the neighborhood's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8428)|
| 2:20:34| and I would defer to Commissioner Andrews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| but usually when you have these dead-end roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| or you have roads that are closed, it also reduces crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| because people don't like to break into houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| where there's only one way in and one way out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| and for a multitude of reasons is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| I would like to keep the motion the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I went out there on Saturday and met with some of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| and walked the property and saw the old barn and went way back up in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| and then drove Nubbins Ridge, and as I looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8465)|
| 2:21:08| and as I came through and came back down Dunair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| and drove back through, came back up Delmere again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8471)|
