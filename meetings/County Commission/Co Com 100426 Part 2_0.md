| 0:00:00| Alpha question for Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| I was going to make one, you know, just one last reminder for anyone who hasn't heard this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4)|
| 0:00:10| There are potentially a lot of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:12| I know Commissioner Pinkston had some questions at the finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| I thought they were very good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:18| But the potential savings from these are, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=18)|
| 0:00:22| 17 to 25 percent of the 1,100 prisoners that we have in our jail system are mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=22)|
| 0:00:28| And many of those people don't belong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=28)|
| 0:00:31| It's really like the difference between keeping them in the Hyatt versus keeping them at a Motel 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| We can keep them at a much lower cost to the county by having them go to a safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:42| and we can also move them through the safety center a lot quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| And thirdly, we can get those people the help they need so they're not repeat offenders or repeat admittances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=45)|
| 0:00:54| The other thing is that we are under court scrutiny on overcrowding in our jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| Right now, it only involves the downtown jail, but they're looking at the facility out at Maloneyville also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=59)|
| 0:01:08| If we have to build another pod, which we're getting close to that point, the last one cost 15 or 16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:15| Probably in a year or two, we're talking about 20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| If you look at a 3 percent interest rate, you're talking about just an interest, $600,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| You've already seen what the cost of the drugs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| Those will come, will go out of the county sheriff's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| I do have a lot of the concerns in talking with Mrs. Kelly about these people who really depend upon the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:38| Where can we find that additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| And I was working on a number of $205,000 to help them repair the roofs and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| I know this was unpopular with some people, but recall that we're reducing the commission by eight members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| We'll save roughly $192,000 just in salaries and an additional $48,000 in discretionary funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=112)|
| 0:02:02| unless we want to dip into that for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| That's $240,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| So that's new money that we have that perhaps the county can use to help CAC with the people to repair the roofs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| and do these other things that they do that are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| And finally, we've talked about the economics of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| It's just the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Do we want to put mentally ill people in jail, not give them any help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| and then also at a very expensive way of keeping them there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| And for that reason, I think we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| There's been a lot of scrutiny on this, again, by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| And we have momentum now, and I think it's time to go ahead to decide to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| This has been almost 20 years since the Carter decision came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| and I think it's time that we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Okay, I heard a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| Are you still wanting to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=177)|

| 0:03:48| Mr. Schaus and Mr. Anders wanted to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| I think they deserve a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=230)|

| 0:04:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Commissioner Pinkston votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=261)|
| 0:04:33| The call fails ten noes and only eight ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| So Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| My question will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| For Grant, though, I'm going to ask about the amortization data sheet you gave us last Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| It's still accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| It's a rough draft proposal of what Section 108 would look like if approved by HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| So it's not set in stone, but it's generally what it would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| Borrow from private lender at three-month LIBOR plus 20 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| I know London Interbank offered rate, but three-month LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| Is that fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| I literally went on the HUD website, looked up what the interest rate was, and I pulled up what the LIBOR was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| and came up with that .5 percent interest for the Section 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| But obviously at the time we apply, we have to borrow the money from a private lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| My question is, would it be fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| I think it's fixed, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| I can't say for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Because if it's not fixed, we in the pension board this morning, we discussed interest rates are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| You know, nine out of ten bond traders said they're going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| So if it's not fixed and it goes up, that throws your numbers all out of whack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| It could, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Well, and also keep in mind, that's a good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| keep in mind the total dollar amount we get each year is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| So there are two variables there that could throw this thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Now we got about an 8 percent increase this year in CDBG funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| But who's to say what we could get next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| That's the only thing that jumps out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| I mean, if somebody's going to loan us that money for five years, man, that's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| But if there's, you know, interest rates could double without question in two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| if the market turns that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| And I believe if HUD were to approve the Section 108, they're backing up the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| So no matter what, HUD is going to be securing this loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| I certainly support the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| I just wanted to make sure we knew that's not fixed cheap, cheap money for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| As we move forward, we'll have a lot more detail for you and I'll have more concrete answers for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| I think it's real important that the commissioners are aware, number one, that if we don't do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| the federal judge is going to do it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| And number two, and I wish I had General Nichols' draw that I could have said that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| because I had a lot more authority from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| But what people don't realize is that as soon as somebody's booked into Knox County Intake Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| they lose their TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| If a safety center is established and it's run by a private caretaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| they can bill TennCare and the county don't have to pay $600,000 a year for medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| So we're going to see an immediate savings soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| I say immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| We're going to see savings very soon on our medicines as soon as we start putting people through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| instead of booking them in Knox County Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Now, if you want to choose to sit on your hands like past commissions have and not address this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| I believe we're very close to a federal judge addressing it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| And so I think we need to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| Mr. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| In addition to the TennCare problem, when people are taken to jail and they lose their TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| they lose their other benefits too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| And that makes it twice as hard or ten times as hard for them to get those benefits back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| And that includes their Section 8 vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| So when we're talking about being able to provide housing for these people as they come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| it can take six months to a year to get those reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| So we're just making things go from bad to worse, I think, if we don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| So I think that there are a lot of places that we're going to see some savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| I just want to make sure everyone is aware of what the financial picture looks like right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| But definitely I think all of us realize how good this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| And it should have been done years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| And we need to do it as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| I hope most of the discussion is about over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| But for the law director and for you, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| I just want to let you know that I do serve on the board for Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| I do not receive any monetary money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Instead, I give them money as being a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| And I gladly do give that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| So I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| I've had a request for a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Clerk, if you'll read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| The next item has been moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| It's listed on page 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Which is the discussion regarding the due ten intent challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| Excuse me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| If we could have order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Everybody have their seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Well, we're going to have the best order as I can have, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| We're going to have a discussion on the ten on ten challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| It's called the due ten intent challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| And this is something I've been working on for the last few months in conjunction with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| And that's a special initiative for the year 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| And as we move through it, you'll kind of see why I'm calling it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| And Jolie is getting the slideshow set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:25| Is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:40| Hey, I just got back from Girl Scout camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Do you all want to sing a song while we're waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| Just tell us on your laptop how to access a second monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| We'd be in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Why don't we move it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| We moved it up when we did amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Commissioner Broyles asked for it to be moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| And it's been moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| But if we can't get this working, we'll have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Could we maybe move on and then come back when it's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| Are we rolling or do we need a few minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| We'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Let's go to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| We'll come back after we get to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| We're on page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| We're back on track now with the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Resolution 206 is approving an extension to the lease agreement with Mack Walker for the mascot branch library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:55| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| So where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| What page are we in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Page nine, 206.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Intergovernmental, 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| Mr. Pinkston, was there any reason why there was no recommendation from finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| 206.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| I don't believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Seeing no lights on, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Page 11, resolution 501 is approving number one, the draft Knox County 2010-2015 consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=775)|
| 0:13:04| including the focus group comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Two, the 2010-2011 Knox County annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| Three, the Knox County analysis of the impediments to fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| And four, Knox County citizen participation plan, resolution 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| 8-0 to approve with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| I think that amendment was more of a legal kind of an issue just to clean things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| Mr. Law Director, do you remember the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:45| Mr. Norman, do you remember the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| I do not remember the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| Again, it was something, I don't know if Grant is in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| but it was something to do with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| It had to do with the con plan for the public safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Was that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| We actually did it in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| He pulled it forward so that we could do this one afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| And it may have been something with the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| We just needed to do the other one first before we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| we needed to agree on what the con plan was going to say before we amended the con plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| which is why we did the first one before this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| And we did the RFP, so there isn't really anything else to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| So the amendment now is a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| I think we need to amend the con plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Yeah, that was something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| It wasn't just the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| It was something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| I believe Grant Rosenberg mentioned the public safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| and that if that's going to be considered in this resolution, that should be mentioned on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| That was to be added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| I'll make the motion that we defer for 30 days so we can figure out what we vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| No, we need to get this one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| But do we have a motion to approve this as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| Motion to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| I'll second because the amendment was added at the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| And the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| I think Commissioner Andrews is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| I think it was just some verbiage in here to say that part of the five-year plan now includes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=909)|
| 0:15:18| That's what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| That's my recollection as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| So Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| I just want to speak to make sure that the amendment is that there's a safety center involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| I'm on down, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| We're discussing the con plan grant and the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Is the only amendment you need to the con plan to include the safety center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| We had some comments at our public meeting last week related to the need for a safety center proposal in our con plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:52| With commission's amendments, we would include that in our submittal to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| So that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| The motion is to approve with the amendment of the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| We're going to move as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Commissioner Burroughs, are we ready to roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| You're on the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| This isn't directed at me, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| You all know how I can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| I mean it says healthy bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| We have witnessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| This is an initiative that I've been working on for 2010 with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| And I'm really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| And I think it's going to be a lot of fun for the people who participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| And I think it's going to be a good thing for my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| So I want you all to take a look at it, too, and see if you're interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| So all you have to do is click that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah, the background is that Knox County is one of the 41 sites selected to participate in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Healthy Kids, Healthy Communities initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| And we also have going our Together Healthy Knox, which the health department came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| and spoke to us about a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| And so what we're talking about is that there's no single entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| or agency that can make the community healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| It takes all of us working together to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| So this is just one more component in trying to create a healthier Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:35| The health department is launching its Active 8 program next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| and that's an initiative where they're trying to encourage Knox County citizens to get active over the next eight weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| and to get involved with the things that we have available, our parks and recreation programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| And Bright Start yesterday started a walking program for Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| So there are a lot of things going on right now that kind of all tie in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| And healthy weight is the biggest challenge for Knox County and Tennessee as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| We're a society of overweight people, not just adults, but also children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| And that's one of the reasons we got the Robert Woods Foundation grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| So what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| For healthy bodies, we want to aim for 10 servings of fruits and vegetables every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| take 10,000 steps every day or get at least 30 minutes of physical activity five days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| aim for your kids to get 10 hours of active play time every week, spend 10 minutes stretching every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| and if you're overweight, aim to lose 10 percent of your total body weight over six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| and as a family, strive to eat at least 10 dinners together per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| And we researched all of these components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| And on the website, there are links to the supporting documentation for all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| and also online tools that help you figure out your body mass index, what 10 percent of your weight is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| what's a serving of vegetables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| So this is just the pared-down version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Online, it will have links to all the tools and supporting documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| Healthy minds, check out and read 10 books from our public library this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Limit non-work screen time to 10 hours per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Spend 10 minutes every day in meditation or prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Save 10 percent of your income at minimum for emergencies or for your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| And learn the meaning of 10 new words each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| And those are all things that keep your mind stimulated and engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Healthy communities, volunteer 10 days each year or, if you're really ambitious, 10 hours each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| Donate 10 percent of your income to your favorite charity, your faith organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| Spend $10 each week at a locally owned and operated business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Get to know 10 neighbors this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| Tell 10 people each month how much you appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| And I'm going to tell you all right now how much I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| So I've done mine for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| In fact, I've gone above 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| And also pick up 10 pieces of trash every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Healthy planet is make 10 percent of your diet local, in-season foods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| And that averages out to about two meals and two snacks per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| And like I said, online, there are tools that you are linked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| where you can go figure out exactly how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Increase your recycling by 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Make 10 percent of your purchases fair trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Take alternative transportation 10 times a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| And have at least 10 reusable bags to take with you to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| No more plastic bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| These are all healthy habits and screenings that everyone needs to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| from a complete physical every year to getting your teeth cleaned and examined twice a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| to checking moles on your body for skin cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| And everybody who does those will get awarded points for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| So there's two ways to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| The personal challenge, and this is for the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Every resident who completes 10 challenges or racks up 100 points gets a reward card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| which will entitle them to 10 percent off products and services and second district businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| There's also a neighborhood challenge component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| where the neighborhoods will be competing against each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| Whichever neighborhood has the most participants is going to win $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| The neighborhood which altogether loses the most weight over six months gets $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| And the neighborhood which contributes over six months the most volunteer hours is going to win $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| Getting started, Monday night the residents of the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| and anybody else in the county who wants to can come to the health department Monday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| May 3rd, and they'll get a free health and fitness assessment and get enrolled in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| And the health department is giving us all free pedometers to track our steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| If you want to do the 10,000 steps a day component, you get a free pedometer to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| Also on the website there are links where you can just download the forms and get started at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| You don't have to come to the health department, but if you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| you'll get a complete physical assessment, fitness assessment, and height, weight, all of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| So, and I'm not asking anybody to do something that I'm not willing to do myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| and along with my family, my husband, and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| We're all going to be participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| We're going to be tracking our progress online and blogging about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| The kids will probably be complaining that mom and dad are feeding them more vegetables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| you know, that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Our website and blog will go live on Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| And like I said, all the information will be posted down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| I'm also going to have all this posted on the commission forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| My personal goals, I've been carrying extra weight since I was pregnant with Aiden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| who will be nine years old this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| So the procrastination for me has to stop right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| My cholesterol is above 400, and I'm 42 years old, and I've never had a mammogram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| So these are all issues that I'm going to address during this 10 in 10 challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| and I'll be blogging about it online and tracking it on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| So I'm trying to set a healthy example of living a healthy lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| And for the commission challenge, most of us need to drop a few pounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| and have healthier habits, and I'm challenging everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| except for Ed and Dave, who have become transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| and maybe blow away if they're any thinner, to a weight loss competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| And whoever wants to participate can, and whoever loses the most weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| will be treated to dinner out from the rest of the losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| So your district can also participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| If you want to challenge other districts to any of this, you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| or we can just do neighborhood to neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| So the goals, of course, are increased individual health and fitness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| communities that are more engaged, more vibrant, healthier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| focusing on mental health as well as physical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| We'd hope to see a decrease in depression, isolation, and illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| which all results in a relaxed and happier Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| So that's the dreaded commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| I take this as an example of a lack of mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| No, that's our dreaded commissioner, Mark Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| in his dreadlocks wig while he was relaxing on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| So this is the goal for all of us, is to be that relaxed and that happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| when all of this is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| So I hope that those of you who would like to drop a little weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| will do this with me and will think about encouraging the rest of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| of your district to participate in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| I've got a 50-pound head start on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Does that count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| No, we're going to start Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Whatever weight you are on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| and if you don't want to come to the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| there are Weight Watchers groups that are meeting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| at the city county building now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| and you could probably go do a weigh-in with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1490)|

| 0:25:15| We're on page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Resolution 904 is rescinding the past approval of Scott Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| for the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| and immediately removing him from that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:34| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1534)|

| 0:25:42| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Mr. Law Director, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| Yes, he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| He's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| He has appeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Like a magician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| We're on 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| isn't there something in Robert's Rules of Order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| that if you try to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| that you can't bring it back for a certain length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| because it just seems like this comes back every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| in a different form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| and if I remember Robert's Rules of Order correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| that there's supposed to be a time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| at which something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| that there's a time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| before it can be brought back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| and I would challenge that this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| the first one was, let's throw him off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| and now we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| let's pretend like we never appointed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| It looks the same to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Well, sir, I think there's a distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| between voting on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| and then trying to bring it back later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| than something that you've deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| and that there was never a definitive vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| And, you know, your point's well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Robert's Rules is about a 750-page tome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| that is oftentimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| in and of itself, appears conflicting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| but in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I think this is properly before the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Furthermore, didn't Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| recuse himself from all discussion of this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I'm discussing whether the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| can be before us again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| not that I will vote any certain way on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| given the fact that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| when this body got together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| as a quasi-judicial board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| it was, at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| continued until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| heard or denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| BZA member Moore's appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| does that not put this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| where we need to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| or do they not conflict in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Well, I think you have two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| And likewise, again, Tennessee code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| outlines the specificity of the manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| in which someone is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| And your removal procedures require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Well, does this not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| is this not contradictory to that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| to try to remove him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| after he's been elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| to that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| to try to remove him in this particular matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Elected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Well, he is elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| I mean, appointed or elected to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| to serve on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| sets out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| defined way of how to remove someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| from these types of boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| once they've been appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| that you can go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| and redo that the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Commissioner Harmon is doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| I'm just asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| is that really the proper way to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| considering there is state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| saying how to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| someone from one of these boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Considering the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| state law articulates the manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| in which a person on a board like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| is to be removed, this would be subject to challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| You've already got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| you've got a state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| that outlines the specificity of the methodology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| and that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| you should follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| So that's your recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| that we should follow the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| followed by going through the judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Well, that's what the state statute requires you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| He also said that this matter is properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| So simply repeat your cowardly vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I am going to take exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| to the remark there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| I don't think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| continue to make personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| I'm not making this personal and I hope that you don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| But I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| The motion is to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| since I abstained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| from the previous vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| have I abstained from this vote as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Commissioner, I would suggest you do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| because this is essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| requesting the same relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| And that's where my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| If this is essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| the same vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| why would this be properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| if we've already acted on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| I mean, it's either the same vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| or it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| If it's the same vote, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| it's not properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| If it's a different vote, then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| that those of us who abstained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| get to choose so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| And I also would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| to note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| one of our colleagues has called the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| of us cowards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I believe that that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| I believe that he should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| whether he wants to withdraw those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| because I would believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| that that could possibly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| a censurable offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| It's not a dueling offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| in these more polite times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| that we live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| but it's certainly not a pleasant thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| for a commissioner to throw out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| at an entire body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| to answer just the first portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| there's a distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| between whether or not you should take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| the action before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| There's a distinction between that and whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| you can consider it as a body politic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| But what I'm saying is that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| a state statute that outlines the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| and this is contrary to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| I would note for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| that there hasn't really been a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| on the matter that occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Tuesday. There was a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| defer until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| The Supreme Court action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| make a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| if that's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| that is based on the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| to grant a continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| So that's my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| A question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| I guess his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| in correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| is to grant the same continuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| that the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| which is continue until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| I guess what you really mean is a deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Supreme Court has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| either heard or denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| or dealt with the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| by BZA member Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| For the people that tend to line up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| on one side or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| on this issue, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| I've already made my views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| very clear about Mr. Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| just in light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| which our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| has explained to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| given that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| I think that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| for us to grant Mr. Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| because I favor him in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| I've stated I thought Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Moore should have resigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| and it would have saved us a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| of grief and embarrassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| I think for the body if he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| but he has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| chosen to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Whatever reason he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| to continue this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| battle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| I still think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| that I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| it's the wise thing for us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| to give him time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| and when this appeal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| is over with the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| we'll hear it and we'll act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Do I hear a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| I will but I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Preface it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| some remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Well we'll get to you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| I got everybody down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| We're going to go in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| say I've also been clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I don't believe that Mr. Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| needs to be serving on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| if our law director has indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| that this is contrary to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| the state statute says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| that we need to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| I would not be construed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| as that I'm voting to keep him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| on BZA because I'm certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| not but I can't vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| something that is in direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| conflict with what the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| says that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| That's my point exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| In the interest of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| in this body I will withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Is there a second withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Do we have any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| In less enlightened times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| that would be considered a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Okay, we're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| We're back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| original motion was to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| but we have the maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| asking for this to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| we're back at the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Does the substitute withdraw their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| do you withdraw your substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| because he said he's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| The substitute is to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Given the maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| has agreed to withdraw, then I will withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Mr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| you withdraw your second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Well, he's going to withdraw the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:07| He's answered the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| That we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| observed the same procedures we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| at the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Mr. Law Director, if the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| withdraws out from underneath the substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| motion, does the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| then become the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Your normal procedure would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| you deal with the underlying motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| and then you deal with the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| We no longer have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| an original motion which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Well, that's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Then you either have a new motion, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| And if we have a maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| of a substitute motion which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| becomes now the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| he wishes withdrawal, but the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| doesn't wish to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Where does that put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Are we still with that motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| We need to get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Whether what our feelings are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| about what he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| right now the question to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| is what legal position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| is this body putting itself into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| As the Law Director's done told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| if we take action today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| on Commissioner Harmon's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| and vote in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| proposal resolution here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| it puts us in liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| here from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| So from that, I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| If it needs to be remade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| or are you going to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| No, you're refusing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| withdraw your second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| so we can't withdraw a deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| when the maker of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| has said that he is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| withdraw the whole item altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| There is no item on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| I hesitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| speaking on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| we're a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| choosy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| We're worried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| about a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| We're worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| all these other side things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| We as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| can remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| someone that we appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| It's not a legal issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| going up to the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| We have powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| We have been voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| into office, and with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| we have all the rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| privileges, and duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| So why are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| ratcheting this up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Yes, it's a high-profile thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| The paper is going to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| But this is a normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| function of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| At this point I don't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| about whether we vote up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| but let's stop talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| like it's going up to the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| and we're just so scared of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| That's why we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| elected, to make tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Vote it up, vote it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Quit this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| politicizing of this event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| because of who it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| If you believe the man should sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| on BZA, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| If you don't believe he should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| sit on BZA, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Based on what we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| If this was John Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Citizen, would we wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| to the Supreme Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| Would we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Ask yourself that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| And if we wouldn't, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| doggone it, we should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| voted on it when we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Or vote on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| A lot of times they'll get overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Most times they won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| So, you know, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| vote on this and move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| or move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| But let's stop making this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| some big political deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| and just make it part of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| that we do as Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Okay, but just to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| that everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| that we're not voting on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| the vote is not to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| to defer on the BZA or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| The vote is to, the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| on the floor is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| whether to defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| in the same manner which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| the hearing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| did, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Yes, before, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| I think we need to follow the state guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| on everything up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| Everybody's heard me always talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| going with the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| appointments and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| But what I'm wanting to really ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Joe, should I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| recuse myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| this time? I did have to the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| you advised me to. I would prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| you be consistent and I would recuse yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| and if I could just comment quickly, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| as to Commissioner McKenzie's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| comments, and I certainly concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| You're a body politic. You're empowered to do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| But I have a duty to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| I don't sit here and try to count votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| The bottom line is you've got a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| that reads how you eliminate someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| from the BZA. Under the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| you are empowered to remove anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| you appoint by a simple resolution, without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| debate, without hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| And if that were the case, if it was any other appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| board, then you wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| go through these protracted discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Unfortunately, or fortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| however you're looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| the state has preempted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| the BZA. And the state said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| if you're going to create a BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| which you may do, you may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| be a member until you do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| One, you send them a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| informing them that they're going to face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| removal procedures, and in that letter inform them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| of the charges, and then two, give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| a public hearing. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| that is my concern. I would have to go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| and explain to the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| what methodology we used to remove this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| and I don't have the fallback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| position of saying, well, it's in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| inherent power of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| It isn't in this particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Any other board, all you have to do is ask me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| for a resolution. It can be on a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Not the BZA. The state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| has preempted your power and authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| regardless if we're a charter county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| I recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Do we have any other recusals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Is that why some of the lights are on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| I recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| recuses himself from the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| along with Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| And I will state the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| why I'm recusing myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| seemed to be made a little fun of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| in a community newspaper today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| is because I was appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| to fill Scott Moore's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| elected seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| He's had an appeal going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| continuously since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| and he still has this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| with the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| and if he's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| gets by with his appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| and is put back on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I will gladly step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Because I'm appointed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| you had a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Do we have a second to Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| He is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| The maker of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| wished to withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| but the second did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| which means we can't withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| give your opinion to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Again, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| I think that along with Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| and Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| consistency is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| the order of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Even though this particular motion really deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| with whether or not this should be deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| I'd be a lot more concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| if it was actually on the substantive motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| of whether or not there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| a legal methodology for removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| but I would abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I think that's the safest course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Because I'm not afraid to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Are you recusing yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Commissioner Smith has recused himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| from the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| I believe we've arrived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| at one of those points in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| when I think we probably need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| to focus on what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| If I heard the Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| a moment ago state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| in this particular instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| what we should be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| with respect to whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| we want someone removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| from a seat on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| what we have before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| is not then legally perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| and should be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Being that we are not sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| as a judicial body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| having sent him a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| or her a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| whoever it is we're wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| to remove from BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| we did that the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| That's been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| What we have before us right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| goes back to the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| maker of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| asking that his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| We've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| about 20 minutes longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| than we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:29| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I'll take my cowardly vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| and recuse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Cowardly vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| Cowardly vote and recuse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Clerk, could you tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| how many recusals we have at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| We have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| We have five recusals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| which means out of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| body of 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| we still are a body of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Absences do not count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| for the reduction of a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| Only recusals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| or vacancies in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| not absentees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| So we're a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| of 19 minus five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| My math's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| That's 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| which means it takes eight votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| to pass the measure at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| We're voting to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| as long as we deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| The motion is to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Well, then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| recused themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| Let's do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2819)|

| 0:48:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:35| The law director tells me that Commissioner Wright's abstain is going to be dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| the same as a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2921)|

| 0:48:45| You wish to not vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| The motion fails 7-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| The original is gone because the maker of the original motion asked for it to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2935)|

| 0:49:40| Vote that we approve with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| And we've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Larry Silverstein or Steen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| Correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| If you'll just give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| I appreciate the opportunity to speak in favor of resolution 10-4908 regarding KB tree trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| Right now there is a citizen tree trimming review panel appointed by KUB to examine KUB's policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| and to come up with recommendations to KUB which can then adopt or reject them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| I am hopeful that this process will have positive results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| This resolution before you today will send KUB a strong message that the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| are fed up with the unnecessary destruction of so many of our beautiful trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| KUB's own statistics show that far less than 5% of its many thousands of outages per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| are caused by tree branches in the trim zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| When trees do cause outages during severe weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| it is usually due to whole trees falling many times outside the trim zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| Thus, all of this excessive cutting of trees at a cost of over $6 million per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| will not prevent many power outages which are usually unpredictable and unpreventable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| Property owners are seeing their property values diminished when their trees are heavily damaged by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| KUB does not own the trees and should not be allowed to continue to unnecessarily destroy private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| KUB should remove dead trees and dead branches and keep power lines clear of branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| It must stop the unnecessary clear cutting to the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| of thousands of non-threatening small diameter trees per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| Thank you for telling KUB that the status quo is not acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| and to return to a policy of cutting as few trees as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| and when cutting is required to cut as little as reasonably feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| to achieve its legitimate objectives regarding safety and reliability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| And I thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| I just wanted to let the entire body know what the amendment was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| which was passed by the Intergovernmental on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| That amendment was to change the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| and I think the maker of the motion agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| Change the language in a way that reads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| that we would, I'm trying to think of the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| Take out two words, the requesting and and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| And that we would challenge other utilities to do likewise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| in terms of setting up this tree board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| and addressing the problems that exist that KUB is actually taking the lead on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| In fact, I was the one that asked for that to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| You have Lenore City that came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| and decimated one of my trees in my yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| that wasn't even in the power line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| and I had to cut it down myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| or I would have had to have hired someone to cut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| They topped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| They destroyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| And I had to bear the burden of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| And now my yard looks plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| It took 18 years for the tree to get to where it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| that I planted when I first moved into my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| So I just felt like that we should encourage other utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| to follow the suit of having the same review board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| that KUB has implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| So I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| And that was what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| And I think what we had done though also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| is to not say this aggressively in force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| because that seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| No, I think it was more that we encouraged the other utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| and support the review board that they have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| I'd like to be added as a co-sponsor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| That's pretty disgusting the way they do those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| I've spoken with Ms. Roach on at least two occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| possibly more regarding this since it went on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| And we had, you know, back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| as far as what was my reasoning for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| I'm not condemning KUB for what they are doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| What I'm trying to say is let's encourage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| because they have set up this tree trim board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| They are making a lot of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| And I think we need to stand behind them and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| okay, we encourage you to keep doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| and aggressively enforce the rules and laws that you set down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| They have people on these boards now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| who are not just Tom, Dick, and Harry out here trimming trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| but they have arborists on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| They have people who know what a tree can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| and what a tree can't take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| And anybody who has a problem now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| can bring it to this board before it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| So it's not just like they're going out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| like Morales Raiders or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| and cutting down anything and everything anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| Now, I'm not saying that they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| That hasn't been a practice in the past on some occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| But you've got different crews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| and different crew chiefs look at things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| So now we at least have a bar that's been set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| and a board that these people who have a problem can come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| And I think we need to stand behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| That's why I wanted to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| I want to echo what Mr. Silverstein was talking about the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| A lot of trees that actually takes out the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| actually is outside the trim zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| It takes a pretty good sized limb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| to knock the power out in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| I've trimmed a lot of trees and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| and if we look around what KEB is doing a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| they make the tree look real bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| and it causes people's property to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| So I just wanted to realize that they do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| people have concerns about the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| and I just wanted to take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| when they do trim the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| I think we have their attention now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I just wanted to thank Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| He's fought this battle for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| and it's been just an issue that he's refused to give up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| and of course he's now sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| I think he is reaping the fruit of his labors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| and has the full attention of KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| and it's indeed changing policy and practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| And this is good for Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| So I just want to thank Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| I also want to echo what my fellow commissioners have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| and also to state why I'm definitely a co-signer onto this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| is because going out door to door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| I have been asked by many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| who live in the 7th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| who live in the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| that the 7th District represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| who are very concerned about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| and I have also seen how the trees are left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| So the city has an ordinance like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| and we also wanted to follow suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| to let them know that Knox County is concerned about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| and that our constituents are very concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| So I just wanted to represent the people in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| He asked me to keep it short and I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Thank you to everyone here and anybody who is listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| This was also passed by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| and the schedule of events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| that goes out every Friday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| has the tree trimming schedule on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| So you can tell when they're coming into your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| So you have a little bit of pre-warning now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| and I would encourage you to disseminate that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| to your homeowners groups and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| Okay, seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| The motion is to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Next item is also on page 14, resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| It's number 1, determining the method of disposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| of surplus property located at 2819 Tarleton Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| to be through a negotiated sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| and number 2, approving an agreement of sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| in the amount of $1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| with the Knoxville Habitat for Humanity, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| for said property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| I am going to recuse myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| since this is also coming from the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| So vice chairman, if you'll take over for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| In order to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| In order to approve with amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| and I'm pretty sure that that amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| was to go to the $1 sale price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| And one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| And one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| And you may resume, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| Page 15, item resolution 912| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| is adopting rules of procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| relative to the removal of members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| of the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| in accordance with TCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| subsection 13-7-106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Let me get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| You got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| This is more of a procedural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| We didn't have any rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| We may need the rules in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| The law director recommended these rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| when my task was to present the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| I didn't realize I was actually creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| a resolution at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| but I don't mind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| And I hope we follow through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| by leaving ourselves some guidance and rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| I'll take credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| When I first discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| it was with Commissioner Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| with whom I first discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| and I put him down as the sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| and apparently I neglected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| to get his permission for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| But I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Being very flexible about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| I have a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| about the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| The person who would be conducting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| this type of meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| would be the chairperson of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Well, the chair or a commission designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| The chair could actually be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| so to speak, prosecuting the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| or the commission can defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| to another member of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| as it did in the instant case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| where Commissioner Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| was going to essentially proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| if the matter had proceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| we've heard from Mr. Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| that it would take him two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| to present a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| He suggested that we watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| a three-and-a-half-hour video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| and we're saying that our rules say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| it will be one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| So my question then is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| we're going to get into a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| where perhaps you have an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| or they're represented by legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| who are going to insist on more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Who makes that determination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Who decides if we're going to watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| a three-and-a-half-hour video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Who makes the determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| that we're only going to do an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Would commission then vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| to extend the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| I guess I'm just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| how this would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| That's exactly correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| The time I put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| was all things considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| how long it would normally take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| for a case of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Again, there's no litmus test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| There's not a set of form rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| we can utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| So that's what I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| was a good benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| You can always vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| to suspend your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| You can always do an enlargement of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| if you think it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| So basically then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| once we adopt the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| it would be up to the commission then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| to vote to suspend any rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| and go beyond an allotment of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| or watch a three-and-a-half-hour video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| or take two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| if indeed we felt it wasn't necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| we wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| But I guess the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| who is not prosecuting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| but chairing the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| making those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| is that still going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| the chairman of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Is he going to call for the votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| to do that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| I'm trying to get it in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Okay, so the commission chairperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| then would kind of chair the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| You might have a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| act as a prosecutor type person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| and then you would of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| be there to add any advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| But if we got into a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| where a lawyer objected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| let's say you're represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| by legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| and they're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| we object to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| that has been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Would you then make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| that determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| that objection was okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| or would we even consider that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Sir, the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| as presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| have the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| serving as parliamentarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| so that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| doesn't have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| into direct conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| with the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| you're seeking to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| or legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| What normally will occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| if there's an attorney there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| nine out of ten times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| he or she is going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| to evoke the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| of civil procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| which don't apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| So that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| The rules of civil procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| don't apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| So that would fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| to whoever's sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| in the law director's seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| to maintain order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| And in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| the manner in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| you proceed again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| you have that flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| because the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| you have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| you've got a state mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| that provides zero guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| There's nothing promulgated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| There's nothing in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Nothing's been promulgated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| by MTAS or CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| My colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| basically said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| show me what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| because we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| anything to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| So creating these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| where I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| you've got due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| where I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| it's easily defensible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| because it's again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| equal to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| It's not as if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| giving the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| you're trying to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| 20 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| and you're taking an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| both sides have equal footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| I'll try to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| a very quick comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| on this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| I've sat through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| several of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| in the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| We should not be a trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| when we sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| and listen to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| We're simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| let them present the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| about why they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| remain on a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| or not remain on a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| It's not for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| to sit there and judge people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| and let them retry something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| that's already been tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| To me, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| the purpose of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| The facts are what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| And I personally think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| that the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| that have been drawn up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| are perfectly adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| We don't need two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| to retry a trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| that's already gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| through a very lengthy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| I think the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| is given a charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| and he can either say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| why he thinks that charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| is accurate or inaccurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| and why if the charge is true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| which it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| since it's already been tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| in a court of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| and gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| the appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| and there's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| one last appeal waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| before the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| but why he should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| remain on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| and I think an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| is plenty of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Joe, what if we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| a letter sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| from a committee chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| saying, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| this person is not attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| me and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Can the committee chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| approach us on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| or does it have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| from the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| Well, the commission, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| will base its information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| or base its decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| on any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| from any source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| that it finds credible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| We don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| from any source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| that it finds credible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| We don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| from any source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| that it finds credible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| So if, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| you have a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| on a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| that isn't doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| what he or she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| is required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| attend mandatory training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| attend meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| information you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| utilize for a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| if that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| added in because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| I've had such a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| if we need to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| that to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3992)|

| 1:06:37| is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| it's just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| what Senator Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=3999)|

| 1:06:59| it's credible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| that there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4020)|

| 1:19:17| by amending Section 3.08 entitled Knox County Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| to add a new Section 3.08g,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4761)|

| 1:20:05| we will have to have a public hearing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| And I want to defer that to when the chairman gets back in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| and let him decide when that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4817)|

| 1:20:32| I'll read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| It is amending Article 3 of the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| by amending Section 3.05, entitled Same Vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4836)|

| 1:21:07| Can we do all three of these at the same time or do we have to do them separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| Since they are amendments to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| I think it's probably best that we do them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4876)|

| 1:23:02| Ordinance 0-10-4-110 was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| It is amending Section 2-712 of the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| Chapter 2, Article 9, Procurement Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=4990)|

| 1:23:38| Yes, this is what I was trying to get through to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| Somehow there was a mix-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| and I finally got Hugh to meet with Joe and me, and we've worked this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| This is to protect us from things like what happened at Brown Low School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| and the State Street property and your Sentinel property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| I would like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5043)|

| 1:24:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| Thank you, Commissioner Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Does this take those two other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Oh, yeah, we took the other two off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| The other two were withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| They were deferred for 60 days at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| Well, we withdrew them at the start of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| Yeah, well, actually the committee, Intergovernmental Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| along with the advice of the procurement asked that it be deferred for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| but Commissioner Pinkston withdrew those two motions, so there's no need to defer them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| and then now he came back with a separate one that sort of combines these, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| to his intent that he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Generally this would go before the procurement committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| but I think considering the work that was done and the open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| and the involvement with the procurement staff, I think we can go forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5101)|
| 1:25:09| And it still has to be heard on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| and if anybody from Hugh Holt's office has a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| they can always get a hold of us next month's committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| But thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5121)|

| 1:26:22| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| Well, we've got time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Let's get into the, well, first of all, the next item is, is there anybody here before public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:38| that wishes to say anything to this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| Anybody at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| Seeing none, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| The next item is under other business, discussion regarding stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Finance, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| Intergovernmental, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| I think it was referred to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| Commissioner Armstrong or Norman, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Yeah, I'll take that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| Oh, how nice that we're talking about this before 930 or 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| so everybody's paying attention for once to stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| Our meeting this last month on stormwater was held by Daniel Sanders of our law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5240)|
| 1:27:28| and he, most of the meeting was review of the statutory legal basis for our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:36| and there were, you know, that took quite a while, TCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| and it was highly exciting, you know, going through the legal basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| But anyway, a couple of other things that we hope to discuss in the legal process was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5270)|
| 1:28:00| and we may get to eventually, we will get to eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| is sort of some basis for our BZA from an examination of the BZA process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:13| especially as it exists now in comparison with the city's Board of Environmental Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:22| and, you know, in a discussion of enforcement and various other categories of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5302)|
| 1:28:29| that are of current concern to people that are interested in stormwater, as we all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| Our May meeting, you'll be noticed for the May meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| and I don't even remember now what our tentative topic is for the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| I've forgotten where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| But one of the things that where we're headed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| and one of the things that you'll be, that this body is concerned with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| there are some things in our process of reviewing stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| Mr. Grange, you want some things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| The law department wants some things done ahead of, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| without going through this whole review process that everybody is in agreement should be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| and needs to be done quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| So within a relatively short period of time, some things will be brought to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| that will not be a full recommendation from the stormwater review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| So you'll be hearing about those from the stormwater and engineering folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| Has anybody been out to Debbie Cole's property lately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| Is her situation starting again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| I'm just related to stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| It's obvious her problem is stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| Laura.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Laura Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| Has anybody looked at her place lately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| Is it still running that red mud into her pond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:59| I'll address something on that, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| I have not been back out in six months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| One of the things that we had a meeting with the mayor's office and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:15| and one of the things that was agreed upon as regards Ms. Cole's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| was that there was an agreement that her stream would be studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:36| There would be some kind of baseline data generated for the condition of her stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:47| sometime in the near future, certainly before the second phase of the Graysburg process starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5447)|
| 1:30:57| so that we could give some scientific basis for the condition of her stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| should there be an increase in volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| What was agreed upon was we'll have some measurements of volume measurements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:14| turbidity measurements, and condition of the stream bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| which will give a reference point for changes that might occur in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| Now, that does not address what's going on maybe at lot 19, lot 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:34| It doesn't address that issue right now, but that was something that was offered in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| The next item is discussion regarding the Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Finance, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| Refer to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| Several of you commissioners are new here, but a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| the budget had grown so much that it takes a little while to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| We used to get it in June and we asked for it in May to give us more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| We got it last May, but we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| We really need to take time to study this budget more because we got caught with egg on our face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| We had to go back and change some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| The mayor is going to present some information tomorrow on this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| and then he's going to meet with everyone one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| I suggest that after this happens, that we all look into the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| see what we think we might do to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| We may not want to do anything, but then we should have a hearing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| and discuss these items and make it a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| I just think we need to look into this and not vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| not get carried away like we did last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| and vote on it in June like we always have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| As long as this is passed by July 1st, we're all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| But we should take more time to study this because we're not in the best financial condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| I think that was proven in last year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| and it looks to me like our revenues are even down more this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| But we just really need to be careful this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| Along those lines, I was going to get to this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| Anyway, we do need to have some type of public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| We're required in our charter to have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| On the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| And I guess now is a good time to discuss when would be a good time to set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5625)|
| 1:33:52| The mayor will be presenting it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| Does anybody have any reaction as far as trying to set something up later this month or early next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| I guess we're almost out of this month, so sometime in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| I would say probably in June after the intergovernmental meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| So you don't wish to have a public hearing until what, early June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| After the May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Right, because I think we really need to study this budget, get into it a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| and really have the things that we need to know brought out in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| And that would still give us time to vote on it in the June commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| if we had our public hearing in June after intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| Okay, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| Yeah, the problem I have with having it in June is we're presented the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| and we don't have a public hearing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| If you guys recall, we can't discuss it amongst each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| And so if we wait until June to start discussing the budget, I think we're running too close on some times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5692)|
| 1:35:00| And I think that we need to have that public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| It gives us a public forum to discuss the items that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| I don't think we need to wait until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| I think mid-May is a better time because I don't want to be able not to discuss this budget with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:17| and then hash it out and have a long commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| and not be able to work some of the things out if we need to work some things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| So I move that we have it in the second or third week of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| That would be fine with me, but let's just be sure and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| You know, last year we didn't even have any discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| We just voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| How about May after intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| That was going to be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| That's May 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Or May after finance, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| I prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| Not as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| Yeah, I would prefer after finance committee next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| 17th and 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| Following the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| Works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| I'm wondering too, Mr. Chairman, if we should set it up to where maybe we do both days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:12| Maybe we do the 17th and also the 18th if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| Because I just have a real problem spending 10 minutes on a $50 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| I think that if we're really going to be serious about it, we really need to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| And so the schools, I think, will take more than 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| I'd like to set aside at least an hour for the schools or maybe even two hours for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| That's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| I mean, I can do it all on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| But I'm just thinking that, you know, we have those two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| and let's not, you know, get ourselves into a time crunch where we're spending 10 minutes on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| when we really need to be spending time, like Commissioner Pinkston said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Let's really delve into it and ask good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| And then we can talk more about it in the May's commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| Don't mean we've got to vote on it, but we can talk it over more then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| And let's not vote on this until June commission after we get a lot of things ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| I'm like you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| This is very important right now in the condition that our county is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| I'm going to start delving into it and asking questions tomorrow as soon as I hear the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| And the sooner, in my opinion, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| If we are prepared to vote on it in May, let's vote on it in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| If we're not, let's vote on it in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| But I'm not willing to say we need to wait until June to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| I think we need to get started on it right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| And we do definitely need to give ourselves plenty of time to meet with whoever we need to meet with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| ask whatever questions we need to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| But I'm not going to limit myself to saying I'm only going to vote on it in certain months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| I think if we're ready to go in May, we should do it in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Let's not be pessimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| Well, Ms. Boyles, you weren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| That's why we've asked for more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| I was here last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| You were last year and we rushed it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| I didn't feel like I was rushed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| I was ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| I'd done my homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| Well, the commission, before you came on, said we needed longer than 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| or three weeks to study this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| It's grown that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| That's why we asked for it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| That's why we got it in May, but we didn't use that time to study the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| That's why we got caught with egg on our face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| I was just looking at the schedules on the 17th and 18th of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| and there's a mayor's conference that's being held on May the 18th at 11.30 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| I mean, that's not necessarily for us, but that is something that many of us have been invited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5914)|
| 1:38:43| and I don't know if we'd want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| It depends on what time Intergovernmental gets finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| That would still give us maybe a couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| It's supposed to be over at the helipad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| This is all I have on my schedule, helipad Mercy Riverside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| And that's on Tuesday the 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| It's on Tuesday the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| I know I have a commitment at 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| We can break for lunch those two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Hopefully we'll get some lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| Man's got to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| Commissioner Kanter says a woman's got to eat too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| But we have to eat healthy this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| Since only two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| I'll make a motion that we have hearings after the budget, after the finance and Intergovernmental on both days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| One thing we need to keep in mind too, this time last year we already had the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| So that didn't have to figure in our contemplation time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| So the earlier we have this, the better off we're going to be because we've really got two to go yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:48| Because last year we already had the schools by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| First, before we start booking this room, because I'm assuming we're going to want to meet in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| do you have any idea if this room is available all day those two days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:10| You might want to move it back a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| I'm not sure if it's available all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| But I know that they block off a good amount of time for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| And I'll call first thing in the morning and go ahead and book it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| And if there's a conflict later in the day, that just may make us go ahead and break at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| and come back the next day, as Commissioner Hammond has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Now, the other thing, too, I don't know that we need to have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| I think this information will get to Chairman Strickland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| and he can call for that as a special call meeting, as a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| Now, the next thing I think we need to discuss is exactly how do we want to set up this hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| Do we want to, like we've done in the past, ask department heads to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| and allot them time, or do we just want to leave it somewhat open so that if commissioners have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| we're just going to dig into whatever questions that the commissioners have a concern with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:27| or want more information about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| Or do we want to have a schedule, you know, each department head has allotted so much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| and they know when to be here and, you know, what's your preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| You know, I sat through the one, I think it was two years ago, where we sat here for 10 or 11 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| and quite frankly did nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| We listened to a lot of people speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| And I think every bit of the, we did make a cut in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| and that was done in the first five minutes and then after that there was nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| I think probably what we could do is ask the department heads to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| and then if we have particular questions to them, we could ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| You know, regarding the school board, you know, I mean, we can sit there and listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| but we don't determine how the money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I mean, you know, all we determine is how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| We can't designate the money to do this or to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| So, you know, the school may not take quite so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| I'm like you, Commissioner Briggs, at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| We have to fund them 95% of what we funded them last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| The only thing we can do is cut or raise their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| But Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| We probably are going to have to have this later on because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| the mayor wants to meet with us one on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| and we don't know what his schedule is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| So it's probably going to have to be up at finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| instead of the first week of May or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| Well, I think, you know, what I'm hearing is that it sounds like a majority of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| and I think we had a motion and we may just go ahead and vote on it anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| if we want to have those in or not at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6186)|
| 1:43:15| which would be the 17th and 18th, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| I think, leave it up to the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| but I think everybody kind of schedules their day for the commission those days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| and it would be easier on our schedules a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| So it's just a matter if we want to vote on this here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| to go ahead and set those up or allow the chairman to set one up at his discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| but knowing that we have thought that those two days would be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| I'll make a motion to approve the 17th and 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Well, let's have a second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| Do we have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Mr. Chairman, I just want to mention the pension board has an investment meeting the 18th at 1 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| and people, advisors fly in from out of town and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| Is that sort of set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| Although that's about an hour meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| That would be myself and Tank and I don't know who else, is it Paul or Ivan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| But anyway, there's a pension meeting at 1 o'clock that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Again, it's about an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| We would need probably a two and a half hour lunch break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| In regards to the department heads, I would prefer, and it's just my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| I would prefer that we, in scheduling them, not to say they can't come back down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| but I'd hate to have Doug Battelle sitting down here for seven hours waiting on somebody to ask him a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| when he could be working, doing other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| and just kind of maybe give him a two hour time frame for him to be down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| for people to have the parks and recs question or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| But not, I mean, we could call him back down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| but I'd hate to tie somebody down to this room for ten hours hoping somebody will ask them a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Well, before we get too far down, I wrote, John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6296)|
| 1:45:06| If we set up a format where commissioners will just voice their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| or ask the questions that they need more information on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| do you think we can tie up all our department heads for most of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| or do you feel like you and maybe the rest of the mayor's staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| and the mayor be able to answer most of those questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| And let's say maybe that's on Monday and if you're unable to answer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| then maybe a department head could be here on the Tuesday and could be here to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6339)|
| 1:45:46| Right, because there's a part of the process of just information gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| and opportunity for the commissioners to just make sure that they fully understand the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| And then there's a part of the process of the commissioners having the debate between themselves about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| okay, what is it that we would like to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| And so I think your format is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| I do want to mention that we are available to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| Come in, set an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| We're ready to meet starting tomorrow just to talk about the details and learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| I've already had commissioners who've set up appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| And also just for FYI, I've had commissioners from the 2nd District ask me to attend a community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6382)|
| 1:46:29| and I plan to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| And so I certainly make that offer available to anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| is that let's have a meeting in the open and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| So I certainly welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| So if commissioners Hammond, Briggs, and Luthold wanted you to come out to the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| we could set up a hearing and do that, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| Yeah, I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| And, you know, this is your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| The mayor makes his proposal and this is your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| So this is your opportunity to debate, consider, and do what you need to do to be comfortable voted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6418)|
| 1:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| As far as the format, does that sound pretty good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| Is that on Monday we will just ask questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| and if we have a particular department head we need to come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| we let them know on Monday to be here on Tuesday so we don't tie up all the department heads for two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| The motion is to have it on Monday the 17th following finance, Tuesday the 18th following intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:46| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| The next item is discussion regarding school budget update by Superintendent McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Finance, Superintendent Nash just had that withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| That's why it was withdrawn on finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| He doesn't have a budget yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Voted, referred to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| So I move that we withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| We'll just withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| There's nothing to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| Softball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| We have to defend our title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| And we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| We've got the trophy sitting up in the commission office if we want to keep it there for another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| We need to play hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| Dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| I'm looking at Thursday, May 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| And we've been requested to have it at Kansler Park this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| Kaswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| I'm sorry, Kaswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| Kansler Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| What he said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| Next to the Kansler Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| Kaswell Park next to the Kansler Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| Instead of at Tyson Park this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| And that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| So I can call the Parks and Rec, see if that date's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| I'll contact the school board, MPC, and city council, see if they're going to participate this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:14| I guess we could start at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| I think the alternate date, 13th, is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Is the 13th bad for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| For me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| But if I'm the only one, I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Sam, we need you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| I think Tank will be out that day as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| The 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| The 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Is that a Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| Is Friday evening work for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| Right after work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Get started about 530?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Get wrapped up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| Have beer afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| Works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| What about beer before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| During.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Is that going to improve your performance, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Only for the other teams, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Only for the other teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| Pizza and drinks afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| That works for me that Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| If that works for everybody else, then I will issue the necessary challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6605)|
| 1:50:11| Friday the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| Friday the 14th at 530?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| May, Friday the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| Just remember, if we do it on that day, to leave your bats at home and don't bring them to you on the budget hearing on the 17th and 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6622)|
| 1:50:31| Yeah, and nobody get injured, okay, before the budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| And don't collapse either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| So you're going to issue those challenges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| I will check with the parks and make sure that Caswell Park is available that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6643)|
| 1:50:49| And I will issue the necessary challenges and I will make reservations for pizza afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| And please tell the superintendent I look forward to catching his fly balls again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| I will pass that message along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| The same as I look forward to having Mr. Harmon's son throw the ball and hit me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:15| From the city, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| You've got to stay out of the dugout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| Keep your eye on the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| And, of course, the media is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| I think we need to go ahead and last year we had the challenge to raise donations and canned goods for Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:33| I think we need to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| It's open to anybody who wants to come, but please bring a contribution for Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| Any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| And if you will let us know if that doesn't work for the other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| And then we'll have to set up another date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| We'll allow you to try to make those arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| And, Amy, if those are taken, you might try the Tommy Shumpert field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6716)|
| 1:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| Anything else come before us before we get into zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| Can we take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| We're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| That's what I was getting ready to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| We're going to adjourn until 6 o'clock zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| We're going to go into zoning now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:33| We're going to zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6754)|

| 1:53:16| Eighteen members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| We're on page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| It is the request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| to adopt the amended East County Sector Plan in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| As was discussed earlier, I think both sides are both firmly convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| this was going to be deferred until May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| So it would be unfair to either side to hear this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| without them not being able to be here to put on their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| I'll make a motion that we defer that until May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| We have a motion and a second to defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| I'm still curious how this came to be marked up in our packet as deferred to May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| And I think it's wrong because we need to move on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| We've heard from all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| We've had a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| I think the time for a vote is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Continuing to defer it, especially after an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| leaves our voters without a clear understanding of where commissioners stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| on a key issue affecting the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| So I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6887)|
