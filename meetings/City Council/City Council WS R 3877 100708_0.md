| 0:00:00| We will go ahead and start the workshop in about a minute if folks want to get ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=0)|
| 0:01:01| All right, let's go ahead and get started. I'm going to call the July 8th workshop of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=61)|
| 0:01:08| Knoxville City Council to order. This is a workshop dealing with the proposed R4 residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| zoning district. Let me start out by asking Mr. Bailey to lead us in a prayer and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| Mr. Woodall to lead us in the pledge. If everybody will rise, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| I just wanted to mention that Marcia Brown, the wife of former Vice Mayor Mark Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| has had some health concerns and has been in the hospital and so just ask that we keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| her in our thoughts and prayers. Would you bow with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| Our dear God, we thank you for this day and all its many blessings and we thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| everything around us. We pray that we be good stewards of what you've given us. Be with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| us tonight as we convene. Help us in our thoughts and ideas and keep an open mind and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| guide us in our decisions and be with us in all that we do and guide us home safely this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| evening. In Christ's name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=123)|
| 0:02:20| Madam Recorder, will you call the roll please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| Councilman Bailey? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Vice Mayor Becker? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Councilman Brown? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| Councilman Dela Bope? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| Councilman Grieve? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Councilman Palmer? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Councilman Pavlis? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Councilman Roddy? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Councilman Woodhull? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| We have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| I might mention, for those who don't know, that Dwayne Grieve is back in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| He's been struggling on and off with his condition and we're all thinking about him, but he'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| like to be here and cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| Also, Ms. Palmer had called. Something has come up. I don't know what it is, but it clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| prevented her from being here. And Nick contacted me. He had a previously scheduled meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| about some changes in Fort Sanders that was happening at this exact time. If that ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| quickly, he will be coming by here, but that sounds like it's a complicated issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| Before we jump into the workshop, let me do just a quick process thing. In this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=203)|
| 0:03:32| we record meetings. CTV records them. And the only recording that happens is through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| the microphones. So everybody will use the microphone. If you're speaking in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| please speak into the microphone there. You have to turn them on so the green light is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| showing. And if everybody can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Meet us next. Before we start on the agenda, were there any announcements from council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| members, any reports folks want to share? Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| Thank you. I am convening. Today I convene for the second time the stakeholders for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| hen ordinance. And since you would not allow me to jump back over into goats and kudzu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=245)|
| 0:04:14| I'm staying with the hen ordinance. And I wanted to tell you all that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| need an additional two weeks. So I'm going to be asking for a postponement. We're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| good work, good progress. I see some of the people who are in the room here now. But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| frankly, I don't want to rush the process. So I wanted my colleagues on council to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| aware that I will be asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Any other announcements from folks? All right. As we get started on the item, this is again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| a workshop on the R4 residential district. Mr. Donaldson should have handed out a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| of the latest version of all this, which is dated 6-29-10. This is after the last public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| meeting. I want to go over just the agenda. We had planned a more interactive agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| There were some changes and some neighborhood positions. So we've gone back to a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| more of a traditional council workshop format. Mr. Donaldson is going to present, sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| go over this. Then there will be council discussion and public forum, which we actually do need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| to vote on. Can I hear a motion to have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Council does have the opportunity to ask people questions during the workshop. So there may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=333)|
| 0:05:41| be more interaction. And I guess that's it for agenda. I wanted to just start off and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| remind folks of the public process on this. This is an ordinance change that came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| of a sector plan that was being done back in 2007. I had Mark ask him to look for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| oldest draft he could find. And I've got one here dated 4-4-0-8. And this has been talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| about off and on since then. Mark's recollection is there have been five public meetings. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| don't know, Jamie, do you remember even more than that? Because it felt like there had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| been a lot. But does five sound about right to you? Yeah, feels like somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| Having said that, let me turn it over to Mark and ask him to give us a brief overview of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| what we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| Thank you, Vice Mayor Becker. Again, should have a copy dated 6-29-10 up at the top. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=400)|
| 0:06:52| reflects revisions based on the June 22nd public meeting and a subsequent meeting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| the City Law Department and Permits and Inspections folks, which resulted in two very minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=420)|
| 0:07:11| This ordinance, we started noodling around with it in 2007 as a new office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=431)|
| 0:07:22| But during the process of getting to the North City Sector Plan, we started identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=442)|
| 0:07:32| various mixed-use districts, and some of them had a more residential flavor to them. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| at about the same time, we did an analysis of all the zone districts in the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| found that the current R4 zone district, which allowed office uses, was used on only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=464)|
| 0:07:53| two parcels in the city, less than two acres of total land area. One parcel in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=473)|
| 0:08:02| and I think one in Forth and Gill. So we made the decision to kind of flip it over to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| R4 rather than to create a new O4 and keep the old R4, which wasn't being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=489)|
| 0:08:22| Again, the district is intended to create a flexible mixed-use district for residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| and low-intensity office and professional uses. And we give the direction in paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| A, the general description, to use it only within mixed-use land-use plan classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| as provided in the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan, which by reference includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| all of the sector plans in the county, 12 of them. And then the purpose paragraph lists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=528)|
| 0:08:58| three types of uses that we would suggest. One is a transition between more intense development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=538)|
| 0:09:06| and low-density residential uses. Secondly, within a neighborhood center, a mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| center. Or thirdly, at the edge of established neighborhoods along arterial and major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| roads. And the genesis of this may have started out in the county where along Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| Pike we were getting a lot of requests to rezone property that had houses on it, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| fronted on Middlebrook Pike, and the requests were to change from a residential zoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| an office zoning. And quite often those were defeated, although the general plan was calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| for office or mixed-use uses along that corridor. And we just found that we didn't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=586)|
| 0:09:53| right tool to do that. The same situation exists in certain areas in the city. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=593)|
| 0:10:01| purpose of the district is really multi-purpose. It can be used in a variety of ways, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| has to have the proper land-use classification in the general plan. And then ultimately it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=608)|
| 0:10:18| up to city council to make the decision to rezone any land. Paragraph B is the permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| principal and accessory uses. Those are the uses by right. And it's a relatively short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=626)|
| 0:10:34| list. It's houses, duplexes that are converted from a house without altering the exterior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=634)|
| 0:10:43| of the existing structure. Professional offices, business offices, medical offices and clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| and dental offices and clinics converted from a house without altering the exterior of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| existing structure. Home occupations. So the first four are all in-houses that already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=655)|
| 0:11:05| exist. Signs for single-tenant offices and clinics. We listed that as a use by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| because later on we list as a use on review signs for multi-tenant non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=672)|
| 0:11:21| And then uses and structures accessory to the permitted use. This is probably the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| that's changed the most. The original 04 had a much longer list of permitted uses including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| offices and both professional and business. And uses have been sliding back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| between permitted and uses on review over the life of the draft. Paragraph C then is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| the uses and structures permitted on review. This requires approval of the use and a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=712)|
| 0:12:01| plan associated with it by the Metropolitan Planning Commission with an appeal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=721)|
| 0:12:09| to City Council. So that list includes attached houses subject to standards that are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=729)|
| 0:12:18| in the code. Duplexes that are not converted from a house. Multi-dwelling structures at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| an intensity of up to 12 units to the acre. That's the 3600 square feet of lot area per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| dwelling unit. Professional offices, business offices, medical offices and clinics, dental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| offices and clinics. And number five is all of those occupations that are listed under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| the home occupations regulations just called out as uses permitted on review as freestanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| offices. So you could do those without being in a house. Private day nurseries, churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=774)|
| 0:13:05| commercial telecommunication towers, churches and cell towers are uses on review in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| zone districts within the city. Halfway houses subject to standards. Signs for structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=792)|
| 0:13:21| with more than one non-residential unit. And then a late addition is adding to that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| parking that's in front of a principal building when the lot frontage is on a minor arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| road. Prior to that change the proposal was to allow parking in front of a principal building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=812)|
| 0:13:42| along any arterial road. So now along a major arterial it's by right. Along a minor arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=822)|
| 0:13:52| it's and that minor arterial is a much longer list than major arterials. It's a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| Section D are the dimensional regulations, lot area, lot width, front yards, side yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=840)|
| 0:14:08| interior, side yards adjacent to a street, rear yard, maximum building coverage. These lay out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=848)|
| 0:14:16| the minimum regulations that each of the uses must conform to. We call out only houses, duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=856)|
| 0:14:24| and multi-dwelling structures. All other dimensional standards would be approved with a use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| review. As you'll recall the only by right office use is if you're using an existing house and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=872)|

| 0:18:31| found in a couple of paragraphs above for a single tenant non-residential use. So you've got a building with just one office in it. They can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1111)|
| 0:18:43| choose between a monument sign or a wall sign. If they choose a monument sign, maximum square area of 12 square feet, maximum height of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1123)|
| 0:18:55| sign 3 feet, maximum width 4 feet. If they choose a wall sign instead of a monument sign, 10 square feet and no more than 2 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1135)|
| 0:19:08| For multi-tenant non-residential uses, a monument sign and one or more wall signs can be used. The monument sign, again the same size as for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1148)|
| 0:19:25| tenant building. The wall signs collectively cannot exceed a half a square foot per lineal foot of the front face of the building and any one sign can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1165)|
| 0:19:34| exceed 6 square feet with no more than 2 square feet in height. When compared to the allowed signs for non-residential uses in the other residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1174)|
| 0:19:50| use zone districts and the traditional neighborhood development T&D 1 zone district, these are smaller. They're smaller than the monument sign standards in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1190)|
| 0:20:02| O1 and O2 districts. The only place where they exceed these other areas is comparing it to the allowed 2 square feet for wall signs in the O1 and O2 district. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1202)|
| 0:20:21| originally had proposed to amend that and backed off of that after the first public meeting. We felt for a long time that 2 square feet for an office building or a civic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1221)|
| 0:20:33| building is way too small, but we'll take that up at a different time. At the June 22nd public meeting, I summarized for you four issues that were discussed. One, the concept of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1233)|
| 0:20:53| neighborhood centers. That was introduced during the process because it corresponded with our shifting from a proposed office district to a proposed residential district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1253)|
| 0:21:12| corresponded with our calling out of some neighborhood mixed use areas in the North City Sector Plan, which was happening at the same time. I think that was adopted in June of 2008. So again, a neighborhood center and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1272)|
| 0:21:35| reviewing the land use plans of the West City Sector Plan and the North City Sector Plan, which are the two latest adopted, we have designated mixed use areas in certain spots, perhaps 6 or 8 within each sector plan. Sequoia Hills Center is not one of them. That's actually designated medium density residential and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1295)|
| 0:22:04| But there are very well defined mixed use areas in the land use plans. That's where this zone district could and should be utilized. The density in the proposed district was discussed a lot. We have proposed lot area and lot width standards for houses and duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1324)|
| 0:22:32| that are smaller than R1, but they're basically the same as R1A. And the multi-dwelling structure density that's proposed in the R4, it's about half of R2. It's about twice of what R1 is, but it's exactly the same as R1A at 12 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1352)|
| 0:23:00| So we recommended no change to that. Parking in front of the buildings was a big topic and the resulting change from that discussion was to make that a by right use only if the property is adjacent to major arterials and a use on review if it's adjacent to minor arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1380)|
| 0:23:25| And then the size of wall signs, again when the comparison is to O1 of 2 square feet, I've made the comment that that's not only too small, I think that's dangerously too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1405)|
| 0:23:44| A sign of 2 square feet if it's oriented to traffic on an arterial road is not readable and could cause traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1424)|
| 0:24:01| So the proposed R4 is for a single tenant building, you can choose either a monument sign that's considerably smaller than all of the other districts or a wall sign of up to 10 square feet. In a multi-tenant building, you can have either or, or you can have and, you can have a monument sign and wall signs for each tenant constrained by a maximum area and no single one sign can be greater than 6 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1441)|
| 0:24:31| With that, I will rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| Questions for Mr. Donaldson? Mr. DellaBote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| Yeah, Mark, could you tell us how we were using the original R4? You said we only had two examples. How did that get in the code and what was the goal for that R4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1482)|
| 0:24:53| It actually allows a mix of uses. I'm not all that familiar with it, so I'll look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1493)|
| 0:25:21| But I mean, looking at the little note at the end of the text in the Muni Code anyway, it looks like it started in 77 and has been amended all the way through 09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1521)|
| 0:25:33| Yeah, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| It's a residential district intended for medium population density areas of the city where preservation of existing structures is desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| In addition, studios for the creative professions which are in keeping with the residential character of the area are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| Basically, those studios are a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1553)|
| 0:26:05| I know there's one parcel in Fort Sanders and one in Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| In Forth and Gill, I suspect it's an older house with a density greater than the R1A would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1571)|
| 0:26:22| And in Fort Sanders, it's probably that same situation, although most of that's zoned R2 and R3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1582)|
| 0:26:30| Without R4, what do they do? Go to Office 1? Where's the route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| They would be grandfathered in with their current uses, or they would then be subject to the new R4 standards if they were to demolish the building and start over, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1595)|
| 0:26:49| I'm saying if there was no R4, where do you go? The office? I mean, to do something like these mixed uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| Well, to get a use by right for the home occupations is not allowed anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| R4 was probably the only zoned district for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1626)|

| 0:27:14| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Next section is council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| What do we think of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Anybody want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Well, I thought we were going to have some comment from –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Hang on. Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Yeah, I'd be interested in hearing from some of the people that came out to attend tonight and then maybe have some discussion following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Afterwards, that would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Mr. Delvaux, you were about to say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| That was the same drift, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| I think that's kind of – we see what's on paper and we see that, I guess, this has been worked on over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| My question is does it do what it needs to, are there problems, and we need to hear those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1670)|
| 0:28:00| Mr. Donaldson, I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Can you give me a sense of when a zone is successfully transitioning, what that means to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1688)|
| 0:28:18| That's what this is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| So what is it – how does it function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| What's the theory behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| One of its purposes is to act as a transition from a low-density residential area to a more intense area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1703)|
| 0:28:32| But what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| It would serve as the line in the sand, and it would have density and intensity standards that are somewhere between the low and the more intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1713)|
| 0:28:46| So if you've got R1 neighborhood and you've got R2 along a corridor, for example, this could be used as a transition from the R1 to the R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1726)|
| 0:28:59| If you've got R1 and commercial –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| But if it's successfully transitioning, aren't there elements of protection to the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| Absolutely, and the standards that are shown here are neighborhood in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| They're compatible with the low-density residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I just wanted to get a sense in your mind when something is successfully transitioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| and then even if you have an example when it's not, when a zone is not accomplishing what it's designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1765)|
| 0:29:35| Well, we have very transitional zones now, but –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| I mean, it feels a little bit like just a kind of word that – I'm not challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| I'm trying to understand the science that you're accustomed to looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| and I just wanted to know what it means when a zone is successfully transitioning to other –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| I think the concept would be to complement or be compatible with the character of the low-density neighborhood that may be on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1796)|
| 0:30:07| and expand the uses to be more compatible and in character with the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1807)|
| 0:30:16| Right, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Yeah, and then the – that's one of three purposes that we see for this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| The other would be in a neighborhood mixed-use center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and the other would be as that buffer area along arterial roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| That has become kind of a no-man's land now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Mark, as long as you're up there, when you said that the standards are designed to protect the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| are you talking about that G area, other development considerations, the listing of scale and those features?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Because we've literally moved all new construction to a use-on-review except for houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1851)|
| 0:31:01| Through the use-on-review process, the planning commission and or the council would have the opportunity to judge whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| something is compatible with the adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| There's a listing of A through L in the subsection G there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| Those are areas where you would look to see if there's compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| What is the criteria under each of those, you know, ten or so items that are listed there that you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| In other words, you say scale, and I guess you're saying, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| if they're mostly one-story or two-story houses, they can't be bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| What criteria do you look to to measure those particular items to see if the proposal fits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1903)|
| 0:31:51| The primary criteria would be the context within which the development is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| That might be different in West Knoxville than it is in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| Context being the specific location, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Yeah, and its surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1924)|
| 0:32:12| So it almost involves an inventory of what's out there in order to compare with what you're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Yeah, it will require a judgment call on the part of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| as to whether that is compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| And in a challenge as to whether you're within or without the standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| what do you look to to measure the particular criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| In other words, roof shapes, I mean, I guess you're looking at pitch and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Yes, it could be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| If it happens to be in an area with nothing but flat roofs, then a flat roof might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| If it's in an area where the predominant roof type is a steeply pitched roof, that might be the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1973)|
| 0:33:02| If it's in an area with nothing but ranch houses, that would be the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| They would have a less steep roof pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| And what would be the approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Do you have to document these criteria as you go for the specific locale that you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| In other words, how do you judge whether you've done the right thing or not under those criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| to assure compatibility with adjacent residential character?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Yeah, we would expect the applicant to do that and to design something that's compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| Is it by photograph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Compared to the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Photograph of the community compared to the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| Well, that would be one way to document it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| But staff also looks at every case on a drive-by and take a look at what the context is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| So it's a case-by-case evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| I don't know that we can create standards that would be universally applicable throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2034)|
| 0:34:02| where we've got part of Knoxville neighborhoods that are 150 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| Some that are 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Yeah, some that are much less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| You used the phrase mixed use, and I keep thinking of recent discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Cumberland Avenue, South Knoxville, Magnolia, talking about form-based coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| How does this mesh with that concept of multiple uses in a community area or in a corridor area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2064)|
| 0:34:33| Form code doesn't pay any attention to use other than perhaps excluding industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| although even some form codes allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| A form code will look at a specific area and draft regulations that reflect the character of the form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2082)|
| 0:34:52| the building scale and appearance of that area, and try to duplicate that in all new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2092)|
| 0:35:03| Whereas this looks at existing and simply says it's not so different as to be obtrusive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| I mean, is that what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| I mean, you're trying not to disrupt the character somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| We're dealing with compatibility here rather than trying to duplicate a form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| and we have a much more limited menu of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| I guess I'm struggling because the concepts are kind of general and broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| and I'm trying to get my arms around them, and I'm not sure I'm not missing the distinctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| Well, in general, the zoning ordinance is a collection of single-use districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| The traditional zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| With general exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Form code is the other extreme where you can have any use as long as you duplicate the form that's being called out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2145)|
| 0:35:54| and this is somewhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| So it's a bit of a hybrid in that it expands the uses, but with the use on review, we see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| we get to judge it before there's an approval, and the neighborhood gets to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2163)|
| 0:36:13| What is the process for applying these criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Is it in a staff working session with the applicant, or is it in a hearing context?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| In other words, how are these judgment calls made in terms of applying it for a specific application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| We would use those criteria to evaluate any applications that come in as staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| and make a recommendation to the planning commission based on how we feel they fit that criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| and how they fit the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| So before the commission, the folks would appear and discuss the propriety of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Yeah, at every MPC monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| then there's a public hearing prior to their acting on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| Any other questions for Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| If not, there are currently 14 people who have signed this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| It actually says sign-in sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| It doesn't say sign if you want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| So I'm actually going to call everybody, and you have that option to just do nothing, and we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2230)|
| 0:37:18| But if you want to say, I don't really want to speak, you're welcome to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| And if you do want to speak and you didn't sign in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| we have another piece of paper which actually says nothing up there now, which you can sign in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| Which means you really want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Yeah, I think communications is always a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| The first person who signed up is Barbara Pelow, who might want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2255)|
| 0:37:45| Please, you want to speak later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Ms. Pelow would like to speak later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| We will hold on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Next person signed up is Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| Wrong sheet, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| So everybody is good about signing in when there's a sign-in sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Jamie Rowe, would you care to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| James Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Mr. Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Mr. Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| We go over rules for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Every speaker has up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| Yes, the sign-in sheet is that blank piece of lined paper there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Yes, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Sign in to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Mr. Pierce, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| James Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I live at 122 Leonard Place in Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| I'm not the primary speaker for Old North Knoxville today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| but since I'm here and I signed in, I might as well add my two cents worth, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| Since being the former president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| I did have some experience going back with the work on R4 over the past few years that it's been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| Attending workshops and meetings, I got to learn a lot about the zoning proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| And through the process, it was my hope that maybe I could find something in R4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| that would be a benefit to an area like Old North or any other area in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| Through that process, what I see developed was a zoning that seemed to be geared much more toward commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2363)|
| 0:39:32| than as an insulator from commercial for residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| And from what I've seen, it seems that R4, under whatever intention you think it should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| ultimately does far more to serve commercial interest than it would ever do to stabilize residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2384)|
| 0:39:52| I cannot imagine a neighborhood that would want to sacrifice housing stock to allow commercial to move into a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2392)|
| 0:40:03| I don't know if any neighborhoods have approached you, MPC, or anyone about bringing something that would give them this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| I don't see why, if a neighborhood wanted to do something with housing stock that was not viable as commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2411)|
| 0:40:20| O1 wouldn't achieve the same result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| I understand that R4 is more restrictive in the use of the existing home, but wouldn't O1 do just as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| if the neighborhood was willing to give up that residential property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| Again, I believe that this zoning only serves for commercial, and we feel that if this does come to Old North,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2436)|
| 0:40:45| we will make every attempt to fight R4 as it's applied in any property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| or any residence along our borders or within Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Again, Laura and Ryder, our present president, will also speak on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Ms. Ryder is our next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Please come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| You have five minutes, and please state your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| Mr. Vice Mayor, I had a question, just a quick question for Mr. Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| What's roughly your boundaries of the Old North Knoxville neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| Old North Knoxville's borders are Central Avenue, Woodland, North Broadway, also Cecil, North 6th, and East Glenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2479)|
| 0:41:32| Kind of shaped like a strange pot with a V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| We have a handle and a triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| Lauren Ryder, 229 East Scott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| I'm here to speak on behalf of Old North Knoxville, which I'll refer to as ONK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| We do not view the R4 revision as good zoning practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| It is O1 under a different name with additional shortcomings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| We do not want to come home one day to commercial signage and front yard parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| This would be a financial setback to areas where great investment has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| And I see that on some arterials such as Glenwood, Woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| There's some other areas right off Central that could be infringed upon by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| Knoxville has a wealth of vacant commercial and industrial areas to be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2536)|

| 0:42:22| We should further incentivize this redevelopment instead of encouraging loss of housing stock in areas surrounded by vacant commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2542)|

| 0:42:45| bordering property owners can apply for redesignation resulting and in the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| They can ask for it to be mixed use plus become R4 within one MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| Resulting in creep up and into our neighborhoods, possibly taking whole streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| Because where do you draw the line in the sand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| Councilman Becker stated R4 will induce creep but not noticeable creep at the last city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| I question why creep is okay in any form in areas where we are surrounded by vacant commercial, industrial and brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| Are we now going to encourage depleting lower income housing stock and surround it by vacant, decaying warehouses and commercial vacancies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| ONK has fought for decades to reverse economically based post-depression and post-World War II trends of converting houses into multiplexes and commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2607)|
| 0:43:37| We've reclaimed areas street by street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Some streets are still fragile, areas surrounded and or bordered by commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Incentivizing owners to flip them into commercial instead of strengthening the residential nature of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| We should aim to strengthen these areas, some of them lower income to middle income housing, close to jobs, public transportation and health care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2631)|
| 0:44:00| I've been told by city representative R4 is a tool for houses that are no longer deemed valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| That opinion was held about our entire neighborhood until very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| ONK has clawed its way back from a long downward spiral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| We can now boast $400,000 houses again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| If an arterial like Woodland is allowed to flip into commercial, it will negatively affect the property values of those houses so many have invested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2657)|
| 0:44:26| Instead, as ONK has suggested in our H1 guidelines adopted by city council in 1992 and reaffirmed in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2666)|
| 0:44:35| we should strengthen boundaries like Woodland by adding landscaping to soften the edges of this arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2675)|
| 0:44:44| And of note, ONK has supported legitimate home occupation businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| We are not opposed to cottage industry and upstarts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| We are battling to secure and reclaim our fringe streets as residential areas with great walking proximity to commercial mixed use areas along Broadway, Central and downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2692)|
| 0:45:04| Neighborhoods close to downtown are key customers of downtown businesses and vital to continued success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| In closing, I will read to you from MPC's own study, the Broadway Central Emory Small Area Plan, about revitalization of urban decay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2710)|
| 0:45:19| Many businesses were established where houses once stood and in turn have moved on, often leaving empty lots or vacant deteriorated structures behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2719)|
| 0:45:29| Also within their study, I've noticed that they say things like building conditions and vacancy are strongly linked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| This is talking about commercial and residential that was turned into commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| And their study continually cites that the empty lot should be reverted back to infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| And they specifically cite and link that to customers who will use the business services along the corridors of Broadway and Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2749)|
| 0:45:57| Let's not repeat history. We must learn from past zoning mistakes or lack of zoning, I think you could say, in some of the areas of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| What will this zoning do to our neighborhoods in 10 to 20 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| And I think that's what we are focused on is what's this going to look like in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| And I will preface my talk here by saying that ONK's mission is to preserve, promote and protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| We are not in favor of making houses into other use. We're in the business of supporting reclaiming them into residential use. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2781)|
| 0:46:31| Thank you. The next person who signed up was Nancy Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| All right, you just signed in because it was a list. We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Yes, Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| Ms. Ryder's talk leads me to a question of Mr. Donaldson, and that is there are some home occupation uses that occur under the normal R1 and R2 type designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2805)|
| 0:46:59| This is a broadening to professional uses. How does the line change in terms of use of houses that can be partly resident, partly home occupation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2819)|
| 0:47:12| The difference with regard to home occupations is that R4 proposes that home occupations be allowed as a use by right rather than use on review, which is the current requirement under R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2832)|
| 0:47:27| And it allows offices as a use by right in a converted house as long as there's no alteration to the exterior of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2847)|
| 0:47:40| I was just looking and I didn't see it on first glance. I remember a time in Holston Hills where we were fighting whether someone could have a chiropractic office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2860)|
| 0:47:52| And there were some exceptions like I want to say medical office and a few other things that were allowed, but I don't see that under R1 unless that's a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2872)|
| 0:48:03| It is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| And the other thing about a home occupation is it cannot take up more than 25 percent of the floor space, and actually you have to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| So it's an incidental use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| It's an incidental use, and you have to have a home with an office at it as opposed to just an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| R4 is almost the primary use for the occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| Next speaker is David Gartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| David Gartner, 207 Lake Forest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| I have to start saying I'm speaking for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I'm not speaking for any of the organizations I'm with, not even my neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| There happens to be kind of a couple third rails in neighborhood association politics, and one of them is converting residences to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2930)|
| 0:48:59| My concern is that I'm on my neighborhood is on Chapman Highway, and we have residents on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2939)|
| 0:49:07| and I wonder whether or not they're going to be able to hold their value as residences and what happens if they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| I mean, if you have good ideas for how to keep those houses holding value, I'd be glad to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| But at this moment, I don't know enough to know how to do that, and my concern is that it may happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2960)|
| 0:49:29| And so if they ended up not holding value and being converted, I would like to have an RF4 ordinance to kind of limit to what it gets converted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2969)|
| 0:49:47| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| Mr. DeLaveau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Before you leave, Mr. Gartner, you're saying that Chapman Highway is kind of a pretty big corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| and so the pressure is more towards these kinds of uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| I think the way I would say it is I think a lot of people wouldn't want to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| Because of the traffic and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Traffic and the noise and the problems getting in and off, and that it will in the long run depress the value of those houses and make them harder to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3010)|
| 0:50:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Are you talking about the ones that just literally face onto Chapman as opposed to the neighborhoods they spin off into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| Face onto Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Whose driveways go or whose side lots go onto Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| Our next person who signed up is Sandy Gillespie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Lots of people who see a sign-in list sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Ann McIntyre, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Christy Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Yes, you're welcome to come down and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| Joe Finucane, 300 Tober Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| That's right across Tober Lane from West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| I live in Sequoia Flats, sometimes known as the Sutherland addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| That's bounded on the south by the Third Creek bike trail, on the east by Third Creek itself, on the north by Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3076)|
| 0:51:26| and on the west by Tober Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| And I'm used to living in an urban neighborhood across from West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| It's plenty noisy, but I knew that when I moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Now someone has put in a self-storage facility and a little strip with neon signs at the end of Tober Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| but now when I look out my kitchen window, I see neon lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Well, that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| I don't want any more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Those houses along Sutherland Avenue are still all occupied by residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| and they could be made more habitable by planting trees in their front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| They're perfectly good houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Now that neighborhood could go two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| There's plenty of people who are moving in and renovating those little houses and fixing them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| but other people are more transient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Some of the houses are not in such good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| But that's a very choice neighborhood because it's adjacent to the Third Creek bike trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| So I see this new designation as a way for businesses to creep in along that Sutherland Avenue frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3141)|
| 0:52:29| and start parking their front yards of those houses and making more noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| and generally tend to make the neighborhood tip into decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| So I'm opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I'd like to have a more definite boundary between commercial and residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| and not some kind of a gray area where businesses can sneak in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Next speaker is Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| My name is Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| I'm here representing the position of the Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| We discussed this issue at length this past Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| About 18 members were present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| We unanimously voted to be opposed to this in all forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| First, thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| And at the risk of encouraging Councilman Woodhull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| I would like to say that his earlier question I thought was absolutely brilliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| It's never been brought up in the whole history of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| How do you know when a transitional zone is transitioning properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| We've talked about that at great length in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| because we have many areas where commercial butts right into residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| Through the years, we have tried buffer zones, office here, R2 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| And what we have found, some of the worst property in all of Norwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| is not the car lots on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| They're commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| It's not abandoned houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| It's the transition zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| You know, it may say R4 on a piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| but if you're the house next to it and you look up and there's a doctor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| to give you an example from Norwood, we have a chiropractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| He's in an office zone, zoned very properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| He's doing nothing wrong, but one thing that he does to increase business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| he offers chiropractic services after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| It's not, as strange as it sounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| it's not unbelievable to go by there at 6 o'clock in the evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| and see 40 cars in his parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| He would be a medical office in R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| And there's no way we can say, well, you're too busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| but if you had less business, you would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| The danger of R4 is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| The better we make it, the better it sounds, the more dangerous it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| And let me explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Basically, R4 is designed as a zone so that you can have office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| in a residential neighborhood without calling it office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| It's the ultimate, let's have our cake and eat it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| As someone who comes from a very working-class part of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| we struggle every day against absentee landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| We struggle every day about the guy who'd like to flip his house commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| and make it practically anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| And we have sympathy for our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| that some of them are trapped on the edges of commercial things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| It's a hard call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Do we support things going office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| Do we allow them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| The danger of R4, and we've seen it time after time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| and we could point out Norwood, Inskip, many examples of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| Shasta Lane is probably one of the best examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| The huge zoning mistake made by the MPC in the 1980s still haunts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| Once you get the foothold in, then the neighbors look around and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| well, they have an office situation there, why can't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| And then the other neighbors say, well, I really didn't want to live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| and I've got a chance to sell, so I'll sell to this rental guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| and he'll rent it for me or he'll rent it for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| Of course it accelerates the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| Every time Marguerite Street, which is a block off Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| half of Marguerite Street, most of one half of Marguerite Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| is designed as a transitional zone between R4 and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| or C4, I'm sorry, and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| It's a terrible zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| We have houses with 20 trucks parked in front of them that started off as offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| The problem is once the sign goes up, once the parking lot goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| the city inspector and the neighbors don't go over every morning and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| I'm going to measure your bushes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| I can tell you a story about a business in Norwood that about 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| they called a paving company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| They arranged to dig up their city-required landscaping, MPC traffic islands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| pave them one Sunday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| They were in and out by 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| No one to call, of course, and it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| It's a real world out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| What may look good on paper, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| If we could come up with a zone later on that gave genuine protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| without allowing the commercial creep and without allowing the office creep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| our community will certainly look at it with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| Where this ordinance is right now, it has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| It's not been able to be under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| We are simply opposed to it at this time, however the final things come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Next person who signed up is Jim Bletner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Give us your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| Jim Bletner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| I'm speaking on behalf of the Kingston-Foxecoye Hills Association tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| Several of the other neighborhood groups that are here asked me to make a few comments also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| We've been on this a long time, and we've taken a lot of different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| We think we've tried to improve it over the time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| and generally what we as a whole have been have been in favor of it with certain changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| However, after hearing from ONK, it became obvious to us that there were still a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| that we had not considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| In difference to them, we are opposed to it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| Let me just give you some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| We've talked about the whole gamut that this has been going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| Did it work for Scoria Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Do we want it on Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Do we want it on Lyons View?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Could you make a case for making it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Certainly, if you wanted to say some of the people have made cases there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| Lindsey Young wanted to buy the second house up there, or the first house next to the second Presbyterian church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| and to put his law office in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| We recently just had an architect that wanted to go in there for an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| Nice house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Hadn't sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| His argument was that the house next to it has been in a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| It's going to end up being rented to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Happy to say we have families in both houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| So at some point in time, you've got to draw the line in the sand, and you've got to take a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| But the question that we had about R4 was, well, we didn't see that we really wanted it in any of our areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| Did it help any of the other areas in town that could not protect themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| It didn't have people who were interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| And we thought that that probably was the case, that it might provide some protection from some neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| But after listing and reviewing this position, I think we've decided that that isn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| And the argument that we've talked about from time to time is, is it easier for you as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| or as an MPC commission to reach a compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| And we all know Bob likes to have win-win situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| Most of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| But it is easier to reach a compromise when you're trying as a neighborhood to draw that line in the sand and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| this is as far as it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| This is neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| We're happy for you to be office over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| But what happens if you get that transition zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| Well, there's your compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| We can make this still look like a neighborhood, and yet we can allow this office to go in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| So when you make that decision, is it tougher for you to say no to R4 than it is to say no to C1 or O1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3651)|
| 1:01:03| I think it probably is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| And for those neighborhoods that have a certain amount of high involvement, they may still be okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3665)|
| 1:01:13| but they may not, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| I know we've had one before the older members of council have been here on the server a little longer that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| over on Lions View that was a situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| And that was a case there that you could make the case for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| Well, what about mixed use and sector plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| As was said earlier, sector plans can be changed in the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| That isn't a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| Sector plans can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Checks for plans can also be gone to court, and the judge rules that you violated the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| and then it can come all the way back through again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| So the sector plan really doesn't provide you a whole lot of protection, some but not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| How about arterials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| Does that provide you protection for the parking in the front yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| We recently have had a situation that you guys dealt with where somebody wanted to put some mini storage in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3724)|
| 1:02:12| and the designation for the mini storage I believe had to be in an arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| It was designated straight to be an arterial in the future, and it went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| So you don't even have that protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| So I think it's very questionable, and I think there were some very good points brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| What protection do we have if it goes in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Well, I think all along what we have done is tried to protect the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| and for those of you that have attended the meetings over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| you know that that's been a little hard for us to do from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| We've achieved a certain amount of change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| and we're glad that the staff has seen those changes and have made them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| but we're here tonight, and there's still changes that haven't been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| and we're looking at a situation where the last meeting we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| there were things that the neighborhoods felt very strongly about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| but the MPC staff felt very strongly just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| So for us, it tells us that the tilt the whole time has been towards commercial and office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| and not towards neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| That's what started out as O4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| That's why we still have parking in the front yard as an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| which you all know was a huge issue for this group and was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| and all the neighborhoods did not want the parking in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| So in the transition zone, now we have it if you're on an arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| or what might be deemed a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| Those are the things that we as neighborhoods don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| We don't want the high density, and we talked about a transition from R1 to R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| Okay, there is a transition there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| That seems to me to be more like a more definite line in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| Why would you need office buildings between R1 and R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| That doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| The only time it makes a transition sense is you're going from R1 or R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| or one of the other R zones to O or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| That's the only time that it makes any sense to be a transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| What happens when you've got a transition zone of ten houses for this two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Correctly, where they interface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| And if you've got a transition zone and you've got ten houses on this block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| and it's been zoned R4, what happens when all four of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| all those ten houses are now officer or something else, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| Do we transition to the next zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| Do we transition to the next zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| I think that's the question that Councilman Woodall was sort of asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| this successful transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Is it a change from the zoning or is it just the interface of the two zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| Well, if it's totally always kept at the interface, that makes some sense, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| which is why we were in favor of it so much to begin with and solve the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| But I think the more we've seen, the more we fear that will not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| So I ask you to, if you can, you know, let's forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| Let's vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| There was one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| David asked the question, you know, how do your houses keep their value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| How do houses that are being revitalized, how do they keep being revitalized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| Well, I think it takes two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| One, it takes very involved and interested people that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| like our people from ONK and David from South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| It takes those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| But it takes some other things, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| and it takes council people that are out there that are watching and monitoring it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| particularly in areas where you don't have people like this that are going to get out and watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| We need you to look when you see those uses on review or those rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| You need to look at them and you need to say, what's going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| I'm happy to tell you that one of the great things that Councilwoman Pelo did when she was on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| when she went to those NPC meetings and those variance meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| and she let us know when she saw one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| And I will say the same thing for Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| She has called us and let us know if she sees something that's out there that says, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| did you see this, or she may send an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| Boy, it's nice to get that heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| But in lieu of not having involved people, it's tough for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| And you guys are the only buffers that stand there between us and what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| And I know maybe I'm preaching to the choir here because most of you all are pretty good about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| but I think you need to be reminded of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| And if you can, do all that you can to help us because there are a lot of success stories out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| Fourth and Gill, Old North Knox, some areas in South Knoxville also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| And when those things happen, those are all great for what happens to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| It really improves all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| And so, David, for your tips, get involved, stay involved, and get your neighbors involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| and I think that will help keep your house values up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Jim, before you leave, you look like you were escaping there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Let me grab you for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| In the case that you just referred to, David's suggestion about what happens on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| is the answer simply to deal with those as O1 or C1 or whatever the appropriate zone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| rather than the transition that has this erosion and creep kind of threat that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| I'm glad that you asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| I do think I'm sort of familiar with where David lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| Actually, I've never been there, but I know that area pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Campaigned there at one time, unsuccessfully, I might add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| Party at David's house later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| But there is sort of a natural break there, and some of that is the geography, the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4073)|
| 1:08:01| And I think that provides them with some protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| The other thing is that there are a fair number of vacant sore fronts along Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| which it may make more sense to go into one of those than one of the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| Some of those businesses are being revitalized, and some of that's coming along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| But where I think there is some opportunities there is if you go to O1 or C1 or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| when it's rezoned, there always can be conditions that can be added by MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| and they're pretty good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| And I know one of the things that Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Johnson have brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| when we talk about some of these transition zones and the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| well, if you really want to park in the backyard, wouldn't it be better if you're on a fringe of a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| like we were talking about on Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Does that make more sense to put the parking in the front yard rather than the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| Well, maybe it does in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| So case by case you can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Case by case, and I think that MPC can do a good job of making requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| when it's going to border those areas, vegetation, screening, fences, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| So you get the commercial of the office if you do the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| So you would actually say to Dave Gardner, you don't get to keep those as residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| They have to change to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| I'm saying that when that happens, if somebody comes along and wants to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| then that would be how you would deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Now, I think Dave would want to try to keep it is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| and I think you do that by drawing that line in the sand, and that's as far as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| Jim, second question or last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Actually, I want to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| I'm still not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Because what the R4 zone is, and you and I have talked a lot about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| and I know up until a couple days ago we were on the same side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| that the idea of the R4 is that you can have an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| but it still has to look like a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| And you're saying that's not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| What we should do is we should allow it to be zoned 01, but say conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| which might or might not be legal, should say it has to look like a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| No, I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| I'm trying to understand the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| I'm saying there are conditions that you can make to minimize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| I'm not saying look like a house, but I'm saying, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| you could add conditions to that conditional rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Let me ask you one that was on today's MPC agenda on Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| There's a vacant lot right across from Beaumont Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Somebody obviously is now interested in building something there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| and unfortunately they want to build an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| Their option right now is an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| So they're going to be zoning 01, and they can build an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| What your suggestion would be is rather than having R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| we should do 01 with conditions that would say it has to look like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| neighborhood, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| No, I'm not familiar with that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I know the neighborhood generally, but I don't know that specific situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| That might be one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| The other option might say leave it R1 if it's R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| Well, I mean, it's been R1, and there are lots of vacant houses around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| And if it's been R1, then I would say leave it R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| Just leave a vacant lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I would say someone will build a house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| Nobody's going to build a house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| They may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Well, and you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| It's possible 30 years from now it could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| And I guess we're starting to build a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| All I can tell you is last fall we had the house next to the Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| Presbyterian Church that they wanted to rezone for the architect's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| and he told us that there would nobody ever occupy the house next door to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Well, they fixed it up pretty nice since then in less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| So it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Also said that house would never be back in the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| It does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| So your recommendation would be we deny the O1, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| If that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Again, I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| I'm saying that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| I don't know the particulars of that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Jim, my final question was the horse's patoot kind of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| If we were to approve an R4 zone, would taking out the front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| and the sign issue reducing the size, would that satisfy anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| Or is it simply you don't think it's a good idea because it facilitates creep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| and loss of neighborhood integrity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| What are you telling me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| Mine would be the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| I think Old North Knox has opened our eyes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| If it does have to, if the sentiment is to pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| then it definitely has got to have changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| It cannot be passed the way that it is and be protective at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| But I think the preference would be, number one, to can it, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| Number two, make the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Changes being signs in front yard parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| That's some of a number of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Our next speaker is Terri Faulkner, and I see Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| Let me get you after Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Ms. Faulkner, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4392)|
| 1:13:20| Terri Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| representing the Bearden Council of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| I was also a member of the group that's been participating in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Will you start me at five minutes when I come back to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| I want to hand out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| I want to hand out an example of a successful transition zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| which exists on Sutherland Avenue across from the neighborhood I live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| which is Forest Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| And I will talk a little bit more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| but I'm going to hand you some pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| Oh, thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| I just have three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| I'm also the wordsmith for the latest email that said about the we discovered a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4445)|
| 1:14:17| major issue, even after working on this for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| and that was the arterials and the major collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| And what I did today was run off some maps of the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| which show all the major collectors and the arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| And you'll see that they are numerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| And if you look at the map where the U is, that is the Sequoia Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| But it's going to include in the Bearden area Lona Strive, Dean Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| Lion's View, Kingston Pike through Sequoia Hills, and Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| Are collectors or arterials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| Because it's only arterials in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Major collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| But it's only arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Major collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| Parking within this district shall be located beyond the front of the printer's book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| Oh, not parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| It's all the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4518)|
| 1:15:28| I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Do you have my top notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Oh, here they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| You may have some better ones than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| Let me just first say that the Bearden counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4543)|
| 1:15:51| consists of five neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| And two, which recently joined with the Bearden Council of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| are moderate income neighborhoods to low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| And I spoke about Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| And what I think is so great about the Bearden area is it's such a mix of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| income levels and it's such a variety of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| And I think that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| And it's such a mix of income levels and it's such a variety of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| And I think that's a real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| But this would affect Hollywood and also could affect Sutherland Avenue near the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| Sutherland Heights, our flats area that Joe Finucane was addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| And these are the two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| And also another one that we're concerned about is Lions View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| which is a small neighborhood behind Buddy's Barbecue that has a major,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| it's not a collector, but it's a major thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| It's Agnes Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| And I'm going to ask before I get into my major comments if everybody from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| Bearden Council of Neighborhoods would stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| You look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| You look respectable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| Again, I just want to say that I think that we need to be looking forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4629)|
| 1:17:18| vision towards sustainable neighborhoods in a sustainable city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| And we want residents to stay close to the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| And we can do that by protecting and helping upcoming neighborhoods revitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| and helping in every way that we can as a governing group in the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| And you all know why this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| It's a larger tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| It helps the survival and the commercial and retail aspects of cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| And it lowers costs for gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| It lowers pollution because people can ride the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| And these are all good reasons to help preserve the core group of neighborhoods that are located around the urban city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4684)|
| 1:18:12| that really began because the urban environment was so bad due to burning coal and et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| that made people move to the west and north, east and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| In the Bearden area, that is some of the first suburbs west is in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| When we moved into the Forest Heights neighborhood, the street that we moved on was half rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| And because over time neighborhood associations formed in Westwood and Forest Heights and Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| we were able to stabilize these big neighborhoods, and this is over a period of 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| and have traffic calming, thank you, Joe and Marilyn, and zoning regulations in Forest Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4731)|
| 1:18:59| we were able to get the city to leave out the plan for the bridge that crossed the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| which was a major connector from Kingston Pike to Paper Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| So that's what saved our inner city neighborhood, which began in the early 20s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| So after we were stabilized, we came together with a vision for the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| We saw the potential in all these neighborhoods being within a block of the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| We couldn't access it because we didn't have good sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| We went to, and other reasons, and let me tell you this, which is surprising to a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| is Kingston Pike and that area had a lot of brown zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And we were in trouble on Kingston Pike in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| So there were a variety of issues that needed to be looked at and addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| We went to MPC and asked them to do a Bearden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| All the neighborhoods participated in this, and over a period of, I guess, almost a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| we addressed what we thought were possibilities to build our area into a pedestrian village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| where people could live their entire lives and never have to have a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| We have, since that time, worked with over 175 businesses and developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| We have helped people, developers and businesses, get variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4827)|
| 1:20:33| and we helped some of these offices that you see on the photograph that I sent around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| we helped them get variances for parking in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| So we've gotten lots of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| We've had over $2 million in grants because we had a good base to build on and to apply for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| And to me, it's a time to step back and not do anything that endangers these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| located around the core city, but to try and do the same thing for each of these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| that we've done, accomplished in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| And we have a lot more to do, but it's because we stabilize neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| And also, now that we have this umbrella group, we have an opportunity to help other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4873)|
| 1:21:22| that are trying to do the same things as the larger neighborhoods, Sutherland Heights and Lions View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| to help protect them and help their neighborhoods stabilize also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| And our concern in the group has been that we were so dumb when we moved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| we didn't even know what R2 was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| If a variance sign went up, we had no idea what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| And over time, you learn these things, but you can have real mishaps happen as you learn this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4905)|
| 1:21:53| And we're worried about neighborhoods that don't have an association right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| but that will in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| And so we're speaking to this issue not only for ourselves and because we believe it's the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4920)|
| 1:22:08| to vote against the MPC version, against our revised version, wait a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4928)|
| 1:22:16| maybe look at this again when more neighborhoods are participating in maybe pod studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| of what they exactly need in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| So with that, I will decease unless you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| But that's our position on it is we're opposed to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| and hope that other neighborhoods will have the opportunity to do the same things that we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| with a really good small area plan that helps them protect their boundaries, which is so important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| because when the boundaries to your neighborhood go, you're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| And that photograph I sent around, let me just add that there's a waiting list when those offices come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| They sell for almost $200,000 for 1,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| None of the neighbors across on the north side from these offices, there's never any trouble selling houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| They go for $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| So if this zone is done correctly, then it makes a successful boundary between neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=4993)|
| 1:23:21| Let me ask you a question, and I don't care much about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| but I have spent a lot of time at these meetings and see some of the value of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| The south side of Sutherland is zoned 01, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| So it is possible for somebody to buy three or four of those houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| knock them down, and put up an office building, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| And as far as we know, there's no design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| There's no review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| If it was R4, they couldn't do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Jim, let me defer that question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| You know more about R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Did you hear it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Well, I mean, they're currently 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| 01 allows people to build office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| Then that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| But also, I don't think anybody would be able to succeed in doing that because of the strong associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| And how would we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| I mean, my challenge would be if there was an application today to tear down four of those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| and put up an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| My understanding is there is no vote at city council or MPC to make that happen because they're zoned 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| Am I correct on that, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| It's a use on review then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| Well, you could tear them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| You couldn't build an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5075)|
| 1:24:45| Well, and that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| I mean, it's fair to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| And that's sort of the challenge of R4 isn't good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| And ideally, we can place something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| And that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| I did have a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| There is a little bit of protection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| Generally, I agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| But in talking about that area specifically, you generally have fairly substandard sized houses, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5102)|
| 1:25:14| I'm sorry, substandard sized lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| Generally, you've got very small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| And correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm sure Buzz can tell me for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| But when you go to combine lots, you can do it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5124)|
| 1:25:32| And that gets a review by the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| But when you go to do it a second time, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| That's got to go to a public deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| In order to combine anything much over 100 foot of frontage, it's going to have to go for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| And, Buzz, I could be wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| I think it's an 0-1-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| It's in all districts, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5155)|
| 1:26:03| There are no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| Buzz, come up to the microphone and say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| In the 0-1 zone district, there are no minimum lot area requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| And you can combine lots and re-flat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| I mean, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| The flat is going to have an area review, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| And I guess Ms. Malone wasn't at the microphone when she said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| She will be the next speaker and should come down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| But what you said is that R4 doesn't necessarily give you the doesn't necessarily prevent that from happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5196)|
| 1:26:44| which is a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Yeah, just to make sure that, yeah, basically the subdivision regulations allow you to combine lots pretty much without restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5206)|
| 1:26:56| Now, you do have to abide by minimum requirements in the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| It's when you start subdividing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| In other words, taking pieces here, pieces there out of a larger tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| But you can combine lots, I think, pretty much without restriction in terms of the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| because you're getting fewer lots from many lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Mr. DeLavoque?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Maybe Ms. Faulkner doesn't have to come up, but I wanted her to listen to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Do I understand you to say step back, take a look, put the visioning on the front end about where you want to end up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| and then worry about the zoning questions that we're talking about to make that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| Is that where you ended up when you were giving your talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| I think it's important to step back right now, especially it's a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| The economy's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| There's time to really look at this and see what suits each neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| and pass the things that will help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| Well, I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| Maybe Mark has to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| What kind of cost did that study that you had done for your community group, what did that involve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| It was 2,000 and 2,000 was passed by city council in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| Do you have any idea, Mark, what kind of money is involved in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| But this is a study of how you could make the neighborhood integrate more as a self-contained entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| A successful integration of neighborhoods with businesses to create an urban environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| that encourages people to get out and walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| You tied it together with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| We've added trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| TDOT's going to build us two more transit stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| We've added covered transit stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| We've added streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| West High School raised $90,000 to do a decorative fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| There's been tremendous participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| and to have something like this for a base when you go to a business person and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| Look, here's what the community has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| Here's what other businesses have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| I meant to send around our business list, but here's what TDOT has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| Here's what the city of Knoxville has participated in doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| Then you generally get a really positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| We've never had a business person turn down a request from us in terms of adding a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| to feed into the Greenway system, the Bearden Village Greenway system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| and we've never had a business turn down a request to coordinate their landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| with an overall landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| If you could hand them the vision, they'd want to participate, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| Right, and I think Barbara and the other folks here that live in Bearden will testify to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| and what I'll do is I'm going to send around a two-page list of all the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| and businesses that have participated since 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| Ms. Malone is our next speaker, and while she's coming up, let me note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| Councilman Pavlis has joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| We're glad you made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| We're sorry there was a scheduling snafu on my part, and that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| I'm sorry to be late, but we had a meeting that's been postponed three times with KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| There's a major substation that's getting ready to go into Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| and we met with them earlier with constituents from there, so it was a very important meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Vice Mayor, members of Council, Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Drive, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| and I'm here speaking for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| First of all, I think we have to be aware of the fact that any time a new district is added to the list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5432)|
| 1:30:40| districts in the zoning ordinance, and I know many have been added recently in the last five, six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5440)|
| 1:30:49| it's a serious matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| It opens the entire city to that district, good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| As has been said by many members of neighborhood groups in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| what the sector plan says at present can be changed, and it can be changed quite easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| So saying it has to be mixed use and to say that that's not Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| Sequoia Hills won't be affected is talking about 5.30, 6 o'clock tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5473)|
| 1:31:22| not six months from now if this is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| And I think we need to deal with facts and reality here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Our forest presently drafted does not keep a house from being taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| If you want to do that, whether it's in North Knoxville or South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| historic overlay is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| It makes it tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| R4 is not all things to all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| I think Councilman Woodhull asked a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| How do you know when a transition is doing its job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| When is it successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Truth of the matter is we have very few, very few, sad to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| examples of where a transition, whether it be office, R2, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5522)|
| 1:32:10| has held over time and protected anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| The pressure is always for the transition to go to a more intense use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| from office to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| I did a study of this over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| You know, we used to have the use on review for a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| to serve a commercial business in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| I went and looked at every one of them that had taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Give them five years, ten years, they're all zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| But we're all told, here's a use on review for a commercial parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| to serve a commercial business, but it will remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| Well, baloney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Started that way, best intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| Nothing was enforced over time, and they're all zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| And finally, in 2001, we got rid of that as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| as one of the illusions of what that transition was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| So this isn't going to keep any old houses up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| It's not going to prevent any houses from being taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| It's not going to prevent any lots from being combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| And my fear is it's not going to protect any neighborhoods either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| And you have to ask yourself, since the pressure is always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| always to go to more intense use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| maybe sometime we need to look at what it is about commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| present commercial and office zoning that puts such pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| and makes them such bad neighbors for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| And begin adjusting the conditions and the requirements in the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| and office zones that make them incompatible with the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| Rather than saying, let's reduce our residential, make it office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| and continue to lose our residential housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| which every time we do a census, we realize costs us a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| Every time we lose a home, every time we lose residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| we lose federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| And it's not those federal dollars that come based on population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| are not made up for by one more business cutting the pie a little bit smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| and selling a few more hamburgers or a few more hot dogs or a few more widgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5668)|
| 1:34:39| One of the things that this attempts to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| and I don't like arguing with the lawyers and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| and council members and everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| but I'm going to raise this issue and submit some material to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| One of the things that our four attempts to do and that was brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5696)|
| 1:35:04| is to be able to place conditions on whatever is built anew from the ground up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5704)|
| 1:35:14| or any house that has exterior changes to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5714)|
| 1:35:21| when it's going from a house to an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| And it lists all kinds of things, windows, exterior cover, materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| ornamentation, a whole list of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| And indeed, the zoning ordinance under uses on review does say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| that conditions can be placed on uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| But in this case, unlike planned zones like shopping center or planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5745)|
| 1:35:52| unlike overlays like historic overlays, which have design guidelines approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5752)|
| 1:36:01| unlike a new zone, R1EN, established neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5761)|
| 1:36:08| that has very clear building standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| talks about what the foundation has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| it talks about how big the facade and the windows and all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5775)|
| 1:36:22| very, very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Unlike that zone, this has none of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| I think Councilman Della Vopi's questions were very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| On what basis do you decide something is consistent and you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| whatever word you want to use, consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| what's the word that's often used, similar but not the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| as surrounding, you know, what criteria do you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| And Mr. Donaldson did a good job of trying to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| I have to wonder if, from a legal standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| it's an argument that would prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| Why, for instance, if someone in an R4 zone builds a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5827)|
| 1:37:16| it would require no architectural review, no conditions, no use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5836)|
| 1:37:26| That house could be built, if everything had a pitched roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| that house could be built with a flat roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Everything else had windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| you could have the smallest windows that meet code, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| Why, if the architecture is so important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| does house not come under it, but office does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5865)|
| 1:37:53| And what prevents someone from saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| oh yes, I'm here in R4, got an empty lot, going to build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| Fine, I build my house, it looks like Soviet architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| Six months later, yep, now I'm going to use it as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| I'm in R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| What good, even if you could place all of those conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| which I think are questionable, without clear standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| what's going to stop that from happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| The worst thing we can do ever is give the illusion of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| only to have it fall apart when it comes to courts or enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| That's how you break hearts, and that's how you break trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| And I think until all of these questions are answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| we need to stop and look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I'm forever thankful for old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| They went up to 20,000 feet and looked down and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| we have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Many of us who had been working on this, in my case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| for a very small amount of time, but our neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| have been working on this, had worked very hard along with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| and were really dealing with the minutia and the small things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| trying to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| And they were good-faith efforts on everyone's part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| I can assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| But thankfully, old North Knoxville and some other groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| looked at it from 20,000 feet and said, hey, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| we need to hit the pause button, we need to think about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| because there are some broader, bigger issues that need to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| and I think they're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| And I would suggest that it is time to hit the pause button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| That's everybody who signed up at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| We have a few more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| Let me ask, the way we had done this is we actually asked here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| for the public, and then we would talk some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| We've done some discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| Does council want to continue hearing from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Yeah, there's a couple more people from the public who would like to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| I saw Ms. Pilo and Ms. Rowe both indicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| Are there any others who would like to speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| Ms. Pilo, you had signed up first, so why don't you come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6003)|
| 1:40:15| Or something of that sort, Barbara Pilo, 8437 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| And I don't so many excellent points have been made by so many speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| from different areas of the city, and I have been truly enthralled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| in listening to the discussion and the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| and I know they have been very helpful to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| so I'm certainly not going to try to reiterate any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| But as I thought about attending this evening's council workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| I was recalling that I was one of those councilmen at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6046)|
| 1:40:53| who very strongly supported an R4 ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| and have attempted to be very involved over the past years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| that this has been developing and brings you here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| So I felt that I would be remiss if I did not comment on my sense of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6070)|
| 1:41:20| And regrettably, because I was so very passionate about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6080)|
| 1:41:29| that I was willing to spend so very much time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| And as Ms. Malone just commented, many very good hours of work had gone into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6094)|
| 1:41:45| good faith on both sides of the issue and so on along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| But unfortunately, I don't think we took into account all of the considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6111)|
| 1:41:58| that should have been looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| and I think Old North has brought that really to our consciousness now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| And I don't think we can ignore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| Also, have been somewhat concerned about the positions of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| being really received in such a way that we've attempted to take some steps along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6136)|
| 1:42:25| to give people a sense of trust and comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| And that being the case, and hearing the comments tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| I just am going to tell you that, unfortunately, I would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| that we not only put this on pause, but perhaps we need to begin again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6161)|
| 1:42:50| with all of the good information and good input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| that people have been good enough to bring to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| I did have the opportunity and the privilege to work with Bearden on the Bearden plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6178)|
| 1:43:06| and that is an amazing accomplishment on their part over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| Nothing is ever a finished product, but I did think it was an extremely good example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| to answer the question that Councilman Woodhull posed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| And I think it doesn't answer all of the concerns that have been brought to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6203)|
| 1:43:32| But unfortunately, and I'm very disappointed because I was looking forward to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6212)|
| 1:43:38| becoming a part of our zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| I just think that we would all be very wise to take note of what has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6223)|
| 1:43:50| to go back to the drawing board and begin again, but not to set this aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| I do think the inner city neighborhoods have always been my interest and my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6236)|
| 1:44:03| because I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| I grew up here, and I so want to see protection and revitalization on every front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6244)|
| 1:44:13| in the urban core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| So thank you for letting me just comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| and I do unfortunately hope that this will not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6257)|
| 1:44:25| Thank you, Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Ms. Rowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| We'd like to speak on behalf of and have been authorized to speak on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| Fountain City Town Hall Board to go on record that Fountain City Town Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| is against the passage of this ordinance, this zone in any form at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| I'd just like to go back to the beginning of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| When we first started, we were told that this would take the place of 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| And as you know, there are a lot of problems with 01, and we thought that was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| And we have worked with good faith, and I think the other side has too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| But the things as we have gone forward that have concerned us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6314)|
| 1:45:21| is that it has not become more restrictive, which we thought it was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| It has become less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| And I'd just like to point out two specific examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| In the draft from June of 08, the multi-house structures were four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| which a lot of us had problems with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| We felt like that was too intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| It went to six, to eight, to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| So as you can see, over the progression of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| a lot of the things have not gotten better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| They've gotten worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| There's a lot of fuzzy language that I have a problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| because I think when things are not nailed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| it leaves too much interpretation on a lot of people's backs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| And then that becomes a problem for neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| because they don't know what they can expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| And one example of this is under permitted principal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| It says duplexes converted from a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| without altering the exterior of the existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| Does that mean no additions, no enlargement of the windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| no change of entryway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| It's just not clarified enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| And that is what many of the issues that I have had throughout the process have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| But one comment that was made early on that really disturbed me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6405)|
| 1:46:53| and this was tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| that one of the councilmen asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| how can we expect this to work out and be accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6418)|
| 1:47:05| The answer from MPC was, we expect the applicant to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| Now, that might work in some areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| but I can tell you it does not work in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| And also, in closing, I'd just like to make one final remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| We did listen to Old North,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| and we did listen to a lot of other neighborhoods that had other concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| and we have over the period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| Over 20 neighborhoods have contributed to this since the beginning of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6451)|
| 1:47:38| And I think when it comes down to the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| and you have this many diverse neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| with their own unique problems and situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| and they agree totally on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| we hope and pray you will listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| Anybody else who'd like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| Anybody else who'd like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| I believe the next thing we were going to hear from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| and then have council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| Mr. Brown, you look like you'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| First of all, I want to thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| I think you made the motion to have this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| and MPC and the neighborhood organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| and people who spoke on behalf of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| I, as a new councilperson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| there are a lot of zoning classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| I'm listening, learning, and trying to put a good grasp on all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| But it appears from what I've heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| that most of the neighborhood organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| have some major concerns about this R4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| Also, I want to speak to Ms. Faulkner's comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| about some neighborhoods don't even have any neighborhood organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| to represent them and are not really paying attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| to these zoning classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| And I'm concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| as well as I want to see our inner-city neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| kept in place and progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| So I think it's been a good workshop up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| and that's all I'm going to say about it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Mr. Dellavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| Well, I'll join Dan in saying thank everyone for coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| and I know that everyone, both MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| as well as the neighborhoods, have worked hard on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| and long on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| It's amazing sometimes how these projects can draw out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| But I'm reminded of Alice coming out in the looking glass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6599)|
| 1:50:07| and finding the Cheshire cat and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| which way do I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| And the response is, it depends where you want to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| And I think that's what Ms. Faulkner was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| that in order to protect and develop both residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| and business zones and the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| and make them work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| that some idea of a broader vision is helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| to have as the measuring stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| And I'm concerned because the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| has a lot of old neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| that can be easy pickings for office use and for conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6644)|
| 1:50:51| and probably at an inexpensive price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| I mean, if you started out building an office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| you'd probably spend a half a million dollars in this day and age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| and if you can buy one of these houses for $100,000 or $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| and convert it, you're much the cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| Does that help or hurt a neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| I suppose it depends on the particular example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| but to the extent this R4 zone has the unintended consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6672)|
| 1:51:20| of eating into neighborhoods and damaging their fabric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| that's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| So stepping back and your suggestion of stepping back has some real value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| I'm also concerned about the comment that Ms. Malone made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| and that was to the effect that part of it seemed like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| is it an arbitrary standard if you can't put your arms around the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| when you go to enforce it and someone doesn't like your ruling or conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| and they challenge it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| And that was your point, I think, about what the legal side of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| and we'll leave that to Debbie Poplin or Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| if he's listening back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| But those kinds of challenges certainly do come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| when someone's unhappy about your results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| and you did it for someone else, and why not for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| And we have standards that are different than specific sizes and materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| We're going to use our judgment and our discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| in applying the protective devices to these conversions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6739)|
| 1:52:27| and so that lends itself to the argument that it could be arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| or capricious or certainly not following a uniform standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| So there's some concern about looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| but I think the dominant comment was that let's make sure that we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| preserving and protecting and helping neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| and not inadvertently facilitating damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| I think that's worth a second look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| So that's my viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| Anybody from the public would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| Technically, now is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| I don't think most people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| Mr. Blattner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| One very quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| I think as we've moved forward over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| we have seen a growth of stronger neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| more than we had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| We've got two neighborhood associations that are here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| that would not have been here a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| and I think Mr. Massey has done a good job in fostering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| I think he needs to be congratulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| and I think you all should also be encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| Again, I think the strong neighborhood associations are the best way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| David, thank you for the job you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| and I'm just glad that we've got two growing and prosperous new associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| that are here tonight to help us stay on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| Give us your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| My name is Beth Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| I live at 124 East Scott Avenue, and I live in Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| I want to thank you for making us all feel heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| That's something that we sometimes struggle with in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| It's an exciting time for us, and it's a period of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| I live very near the Central Avenue Commercial District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| and I'm really sincerely interested in seeing my property protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6865)|
| 1:54:31| my neighborhood protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| I don't know if you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| but 1,200 to 1,600 people come to my neighborhood every Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| to see the neighborhood homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| Not one of them comes to see our beautiful offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| And so I hope you can take this message back to the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| who weren't able to be here tonight that I think, in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| the neighborhoods of Knoxville say we're not ready for this R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| Any final comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| If not, Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| Simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| What kind of numbers are going to come for us if we stick to uniform zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| like we have with residential and commercial and office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| and we have individual cases come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| Mr. Donaldson, do you have any idea of how many of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| I guess, request for zoning changes to use the space as office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| or to use the space as commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Do we confront on an annual basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| And I assume that R4 was intended to alleviate some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| by having a specific vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| but are there a lot of examples where we're converting houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| by changing zones to office, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| Are there any numbers that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| We've had numerous rezoning requests over the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6956)|
| 1:56:04| but it's less than ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| where the specific purpose was to utilize a house as an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| along a major arterial road when the current zoning was residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6975)|
| 1:56:23| So it won't overwhelm you to take them case by case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| My recollection is that they were all defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| But we have areas within the sector plans now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| that we have designated as mixed uses for residential and office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| and without a tool like R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| we will have to pick from either O1 or R1A or R2 to achieve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7003)|

| 1:56:59| Do you see a delay as having a major difficulty for MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7019)|
| 1:57:05| if we delay the action on R4 to do this step back and broader work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| We might be able to work it into the work plan in 2011-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7031)|
| 1:57:19| I meant in terms of load coming to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| I think there's a large number of requests to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| To utilize an R4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| Don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7051)|

| 1:57:36| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| If not, I think we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100708?start=7061)|
