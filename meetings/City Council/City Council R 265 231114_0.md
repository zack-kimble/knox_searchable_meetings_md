| 0:08:37| A quick reminder that those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| or during public forum should sign up with the city recorder ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| Also, council rules state that up to three people each may speak for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| or against an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=528)|

| 0:08:55| So the people who have signed up for 11J and 11K, I reckon it's up to six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| people, and more than six people have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=540)|

| 0:12:02| Council members, I just wanted to note for your information that members of our Youth Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| served on the review panel for these grants, and many of them are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| So I want to thank these members for being part of the grant process and appreciate your time and insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| With any members of the Youth Council who are here, would you raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you so much for your work on the Youth Council and in this grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| We have a speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=747)|

| 0:12:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Constance Every, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Yeah, I do support this initiative because it's about the violence interruption that we have been addressing in our community for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| But we have to talk about the critique of the problem to the matter, which is going to be the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| The money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| We watched an organization, Turnip Knots particularly, get roughly about a million dollars in the last year and a half or so of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| And when we expressed the concerns about how some of the organizations that were identified to be so-called partnerships of Turnip Knots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| it actually turned out to be a lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Those are not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| These are the type of things we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| This funding could have been used for these organizations who are doing the real work in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| We have had this Turnip Knots program show its inconsistency and constant failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| We have had more murders happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| We are still continuing to deal with gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| We have had youth recently reported shooting at Knots County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| We had someone get killed in broad daylight on the east side a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| And yet we had this member stand here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| The director, Denzel Grant, say they work around the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Well, if you're working around the clock, then how do we have a broad daylight murder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| If you're working around the clock, then why do we still have youth bringing guns into schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| If you're working around the clock, then why are youth shooting at the police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Again, we have to identify the real issues and the real problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| And the problem is that you are giving pennies, crumbs on the dollar, to ten organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| I think those ten organizations could use this funding, plus the million dollars you gave to Turnip Knots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| for a far better and more endowed community effort to address the gun violence of our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| However, you continue to show the crab in the barrel mentality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| And more importantly, India, let's call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| It's a buyout. It's a buyout to make us shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| It's a buyout so people like Reggie Jenkins will stop sending you emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| It's a buyout so you think that by throwing us crumb dollars, it will make us be satisfied as black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| However, we are extremely dissatisfied. We're doing a 47 percent poverty rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| We have gentrification out of control. We cannot afford our utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| We cannot afford our rent. We cannot afford our groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| We have a health disparity in our medical dens of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| And you think $72,000 is going to be sufficient for ten organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| So I'm here to advocate for more money for these organizations, because these organizations do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| Yo, STEM, for example. We got what? The Golden Gloves. They're doing the boxing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Shorehouse Foundation. Did y'all go to Camden's Do Miracles? Amazing organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| And y'all hijacked Ms. Jackie and used her in multiple ways and treated her wrong as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| However, she has shown thought of ability and resiliency, because that's the credibility of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| We are resilient in our efforts, whether you support us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| And so I just want to bring that to the attention of the organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| Yes, I appreciate you. I am excited to see you're getting some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| However, you deserve so much more. And more importantly, you should demand more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| So put it on notice, Knoxville. I told you all, India plays games for days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| And most of her work was political strategic strategy to get her seat back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| However, she's still shown her true colors. Let's not forget the $20 million she got to Randy Boyd for a bridge as soon as she was reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| However, ignoring the housing crisis, the homeless crisis, the affordability crisis that that money could have went to instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| Let's not forget hard how they asked for a simple $50,000 seed money to start a task force to actually address crisis interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| Because we're done trusting police that we don't find that we got child pedophiles running through the apartment, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| So that's over with at this point. So, again, Knoxville, I want you to pay attention to who India was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| And for all the Palestine people, let's not forget she went to Israel. Let's not forget that trill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| And what does she say on that Israel trill? Oh, wow. They do a great job at the police state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| Oh, yeah. They're doing a great job addressing housing and homelessness. Let's keep it 100 who India actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| See her for who she is, know for what she is, but shame on you all for giving her seat back once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| So did you learn anything yet? I'm going to still wait on that one, too. And I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=992)|
| 0:16:42| Council members, that concludes the people who have signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Ms. Parker. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| I have one positive thing to share and one concern to share about this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1015)|
| 0:17:04| My concern is the funding amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| Last year, our Opportunity Youth Grants Program was awarding around $194,000 per cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1030)|
| 0:17:24| The program description said that the grants would be between $3,000 and $20,000 per organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1044)|
| 0:17:35| Now, this year, what's come before us, the grants are between $1,000 and $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| So much smaller grants, a smaller impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| I would like to better understand those changes, but I'll go ahead and share my positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| I am happy to see in the last two contracts that have come before us that the insurance requirements have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| So that is a positive, and I'm very appreciative of the city looking into that because I believe that was an undue burden on these small nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1083)|
| 0:18:12| But I feel like we're moving in the wrong direction in terms of what we are offering through this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1092)|
| 0:18:21| LaKenya Middlebrook, Director of Community Safety and Empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| And Emily Norris, our Youth Engagement Coordinator, apologizes for being absent due to illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1104)|
| 0:18:33| So for clarification, and I think in our fiscal note we noted, these funds are not violence interruption funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| These are not the Opportunity Youth Violence Interruption Grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| That is a completely different grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| This is a revisioning of what had been the empowerment grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| So in years past, there was not a clear application window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| It was traditionally very, very small dollar amounts as gap funding to organizations to help meet very specific budget needs such that arose as emergency needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1137)|
| 0:19:09| We have reserved some of the empowerment funding to continue to be able to do some of that gap funding through applications throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| But saw this as an opportunity to provide some more substantive support to some of our organizations who are focused especially in the areas of youth resilience and workforce development for our young people more generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1157)|
| 0:19:35| So this is not the same funding as the Opportunity Youth funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| And that's why you're seeing variations in the amount because this is a different pot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| They deserve more money, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Please do not interrupt from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Thank you, Ms. Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| It is a little confusing because the details of the program seem the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| Both are called Youth Opportunity Grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| How are these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Can you help me understand how much money is available through each program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| So in this previous budget, I believe we approved around $250,000 through the Violence Interruption Fund that's specifically focused around youth violence prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1216)|
| 0:20:29| These funds, again, are focused more around youth resilience and workforce development for a broader span of our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| So looking at young people ages 12 to 24 more generally, not solely Opportunity Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| And in our Empower NOTS budget, Community Safety Budget more generally, I believe there was about $85,000 in empowerment funding for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1242)|
| 0:20:55| And again, we are allocating approximately $72,000 for this program while still reserving funding for those small dollar gap funding that folks have been used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1255)|
| 0:21:05| So we didn't want to completely eliminate that opportunity because we realized that throughout the year, folks may have needs that come up that they did not anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| And they have had the opportunity in years past to be able to apply through what had been Community Relations and then Community Empowerment and now Community Safety and Empowerment to help meet some of those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1273)|
| 0:21:25| And so we wanted to continue to have that as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| And so that's the variation in the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| One is from the Community Empowerment and Safety General Budget where the Empower NOTS funding has traditionally come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| And the Opportunity Youth grants that are strictly focused around youth violence prevention is in the Violence Interruption Special Fund that Council approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1299)|
| 0:21:52| Okay, and can you just clarify that I do not see the agenda item that came before us in May, which is the Summer Break Opportunity Youth Engagement micro grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1312)|
| 0:22:07| I do not see the insurance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| So that is a change within that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| We were able to work with our law department and our risk management to really focus how we are putting out our guidelines to make sure that we make them as accessible as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1335)|
| 0:22:33| And I think that that's something that we talked about in previous council meetings with regards to these funding opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| That has been a focus for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I think in the initial cycles, the way in which these applications were structured were very new to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| And when we realized that there was a barrier that may exist, we worked diligently to overcome that barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| And so I'm really grateful to Christine and the risk management office and to the law department for working diligently with us to identify opportunities to remove as many barriers as possible for our applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1376)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Any other questions or comments from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1391)|

| 0:26:45| I have no place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| I have gone to every single apartment complex that I have, I mean everyone, everyone that Section 8 has gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| I've been in very good contact with Debbie Allen at KCDC, and she has a lady named Tiffany that's also been calling around many, many apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1615)|
| 0:27:09| There are nothing available, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| I have called places that I would be, going through what I'm going to have to go through, I would be scared to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1633)|
| 0:27:22| But right now, I don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| I've got two weeks, two days left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| I've already paid down payment for a mover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| I ain't got no place to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I don't know what, I think that the tax that you're trying to do, but it's up to the people if they want to join in with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1654)|
| 0:27:48| That really does not help us that I am on Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| I'm on disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| If I'd love to see you after this is over so you could see how much my face is swelling up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1677)|
| 0:28:07| My neurosurgeon is Dr. Galletti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| He will not do the surgery with me not having a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| So I guess I've been knowing about this tumor now for five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| And I can't get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| And I've asked, I've came and approached you before and stood up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| There is no apartments available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| If I had the money not to even be on Section 8, you still can't find an apartment available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1718)|
| 0:28:46| I do not know if there, you know, I'm trying to work with RAND.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| I'm letting them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Everything that KCDC is telling me, I've got all the recordings, voicemails on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| I just, I've already paid for movers or paid for the deposit for movers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| It's up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I can't find no place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| And I don't know what else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| So I'm coming to you pleading for you all again to please try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| Please try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| I mean, I'm on my fifth month now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| I don't know how much longer I'm going to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| And I also got more grand information about my health too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| I also have myasthenia gravis, which is incurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| That's really all I wanted to say was I wanted you to see my face one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| Because here I still stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| Well, Ms. Jones, I'm really sorry for your troubles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| Rather than wait until the end of the meeting to speak to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| there is someone here from KCDC who might be able to connect you to some other potential resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| So I'd encourage you to speak to them after you're done at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Okay. I yield the rest of my time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| The next person to sign up to speak to this item is Hannah Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| Ms. Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Good evening, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Happy Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| My name is Hannah Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| I think most of y'all know Randall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| I'm the director of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| And I'm here to speak to you all about KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| My name is Hannah Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I think most of y'all know Randall Tillery, formerly known as Tanglewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| You know, we've been here every two weeks to talk about the same things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| about housing, the need for rental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| And I really do appreciate those that have heard us and have reached out directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| because we're seeing those resolutions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| So from the bottom of my heart, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| We haven't seen housing resolutions at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| From August to October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| I forgot a whole month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| September, we didn't see anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| So really the past couple weeks are the first time we're really seeing something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| With all that said, you know, it's no secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| Like, we've been up here in anger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| We've been up in here in tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| We've been here in disgust for our property management company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| We're really tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| We're really worn as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| And to see resolutions that don't bear a lot of weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1890)|
| 0:31:38| as far as the planning, as far as the actual budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| as far as a timeline, is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Mayor, I know that we hold a lot of the same basic values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| as far as humans deserve basic human decency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| as far as humans deserve their basic needs met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| I'm sure you would agree with those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Those statements are especially important when it comes to issues of livelihood and survival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| So there's still a lot that needs to be addressed that we would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| not only as residents of these RAND properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| but as a broader Knoxville Area Tenants Union that we are now becoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| With that said, we do want to continue to work alongside you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| as much as possible to get that weight added to these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| But if we can't focus on basic needs as a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| then we probably need to refocus our own morals, our own values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Housing is a basic need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| It is cheaper to keep someone in their home than it is to evict them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| What you mentioned earlier, housing assistance, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| There's 4,000 people currently on a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| There's not housing for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| 200 to 300 people a week are being evicted in eviction court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| Over 230 on the docket today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| These are individuals and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| That's not 230 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| That could be upwards of 500 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| That's families, that's kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| All these people here tonight for Palestine, for ceasefire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| are also here for basic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| That's what we can boil it down for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| That's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| We need to solve problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| We need to solve problems that are coming from home right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| That's our focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| We're not sending money overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| It's a lot of money that's being sent when we need housing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| We need food security here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| There's food deserts in surrounding counties from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| I know that's not y'all's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| You've made it very clear what is your problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| It was, well, not your problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| I understand, like rent control, can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| But as we're seeing, all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| we are getting properties that are offering no application fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| We are getting properties that aren't doing miscellaneous fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| We are getting properties that aren't requiring certain insurances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| And that is so positive to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| even as someone who right now doesn't qualify for any of those things necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| I'm not Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I'm not on disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| I have health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| I still work two jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| And I'm the chairman of Knoxville Area Tenants Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| taking care of my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| becoming a nighttime caseworker with no experience on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| So really what I'm here to ask you all for tonight is your direct help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| We need individual support with this Rand Property Management Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| We need you all to help us get them to the table to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| I myself have just gotten a non-renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| I'm not the only resident that's gotten a non-renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| That is not an eviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| They are now just kicking people out for caring for their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| and caring for basic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| How long is that going to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| until we realize that 4,000 people on a waiting list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| becomes 5,000, becomes 6,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| And it's a policy issue, not necessarily a housing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2126)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Members of the audience, if they're run out of seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| there are more seats up in the balcony if you prefer to sit instead of stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| The next person signed up to speak to this item is Nikki Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Miss Lynn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Hi, Nikki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Is anybody else for 11E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| My name is Nikki Lynn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| and I'm a resident at Rand at Tillery, 4501 Tillery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| I am here to talk in favor of 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| I'm speaking in favor because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| it's supporting affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| but I do have an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| If we would have listened to Miss Parker earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| we would not be looking at the issues that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| We would have already had a solution on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| So I am in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| but I really wish that this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| would have taken her serious earlier on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| I know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| It happened in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I remember her bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| So we can't say that it's not been discussed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Also, if we're looking at properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| that are older than 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| by the way, that's 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| I know that's how old I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| If we're looking at those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| we also need to take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| that places like Rand Property Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| are looking at doubling folks' rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| because, hey, we have older properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| We have to work on rehabbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| So why, as an investment company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| would I be incentivized to take this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| if I have to spend millions to upgrade this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Why not double everyone's rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| and I can go ahead and get that money in my pocket now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| So maybe making some stronger language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| to go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| And codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| It took us asking codes to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| after two and a half months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| to take a look at our neighbor's roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| that had not been repaired since the storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| before we came in for city council in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| It took them two and a half months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| When they came out, they said they couldn't write them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| They couldn't write them up because they had bids out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| Remind me, neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| when they finally came out and fixed that roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| was it last week, week before last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| So we have neighbors who were going with leaking roofs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| for almost five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| So when we talk about giving tax incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| for properties that are older than 33 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| we need to start looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| how we can better enforce codes with those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| But again, I'm really excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| that we're offering incentives to these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| that can open up more affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| and keep that rent low for folks like myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| and my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| Council members, that concludes the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| who signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Mr. DuBose, would you give an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| of how this program works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| We've seen it work in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| like St. Paul and Minneapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Based on my research, we've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| this being a way within our state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| to keep rent as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Can you maybe give an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| of how the program would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| for a property developer who's willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| to take us up on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Sure. Kevin DuBose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Nationally, 64% of all affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| are properties older than 30 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| It is the bulk of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| In Knoxville, our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| 71% of our town is older than 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| the structures are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| and 47% older than 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| So we have a lot of older housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Traditionally, your newer housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| was market rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| and your older housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| has been more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| And what has happened here recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| now that we have a supply and demand problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| is that property owners are trying to push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| those older housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| to market rate units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| And we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| there's two groups impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| by the affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Those who are low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| and then those who are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| and have modest income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| but are still paying more than 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| of their income for rent and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| And so what this does is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| what we're asking for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| to have some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| to use some of our tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| that we've been able to spark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| new housing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| And from a new housing standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| we are going gangbusters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| We have partnered with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| to produce over 2300 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| in a relatively short time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| But there are not the same tools available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| to protect those existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| affordable housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| And so what we would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| is use those same tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| for property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| And yes, it is voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| but cities like Charlotte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| and you mentioned St. Paul and Miami,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| have shown that they have gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| some property owners interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| in working with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| to preserve those housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| And so I think this is just another tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| in our toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| It is a carrot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| We don't have many sticks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| that's been established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| but it is a carrot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| And a well-crafted development incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| will be attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| to some property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| So some property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| who take us up on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| will be willing to keep rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| at a certain percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| or a certain rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| for their renters to be able to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| and not be displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| And specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| let me point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| that we want to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| and make sure there are affordable rents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| for those right at the area median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Folks making $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| there are rents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| that are affordable to that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| If you're making $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| and paying $2,000 in rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| you're still cost burdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| You're still paying way more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| than 30% for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| And so what we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| is make certain that there is a rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| that is established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| consistent with the incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| it expands our territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| I would just add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| one of the reasons I like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| is because we talk a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| about incentives for developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| And I've always kind of been of the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| that if we give it to the big ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| we should give it to the small ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| And nothing's more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| than maintaining rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| at an affordable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| So I'll be supporting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| I am a bit confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| by what is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| We are not getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| an amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Affordable Housing Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| that tells us what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| is planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| to strengthen and expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| why we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| to strengthen the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| unless it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| created by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| And at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| we would need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| understand what changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| are being made to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| to change the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| So is there a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| more before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Yes, if this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| gets the support that I expect it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| then we'll be bringing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| concrete budget amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| and other things to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| probably in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| OK, so I'm not against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| but I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| to see the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| to know if I'm for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| There are no details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| For instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| there are aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| of the Affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Rental Development Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| that concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| A developer pointed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| out to me and I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| it in front of me at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| moment, but there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| different requirements for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| participation in that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| if we're talking about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| downtown property versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| outside the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| So if that's what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| city is defining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| expanding and strengthening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| by moving into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| market rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| development in certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| areas of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| and determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| that to be affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| then no, I don't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| So I need the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| In fact, I'll probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| just abstain tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| because I need the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| to know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| it's going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| us in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| direction or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Director DeVos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| when we are talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| about affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| we've been discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| that we're in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| we're hearing from folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| about the struggles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| the personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| their very personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| struggles that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2772)|

| 0:46:14| There's a word that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| always comes up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| that's supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| And what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| heard in the exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| you had with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Council Member Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| just a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| about the naturally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| is that under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| a normal circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| rents are generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=2794)|

| 0:57:31| Speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| where is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Gee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| There's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| person signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Y'all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| $25,000. We need to give that money to those ten organizations that we have on this agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| tonight because KPD don't deserve a dollar, not a single dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| You know, the biggest issue we have is that I find it ironic that this man has been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| the police force since 2007, has had this history of child pedophilia, so that was between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| Thomas and Paul being in charge, and the irony is that it took the Sheriff Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| Virginia, it took the District Attorney of Virginia to bring the federal charges against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| this cop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| But then let me talk about how they waste our money, because then he sat on a payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| of what was it, absence of leave, for two additional weeks for some so-called investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| I'm trying to figure out what you all were investigating exactly, because once it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| proven and he was federally charged, he should have been dismissed immediately and if anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| faced additional charges out of Knoxville, Knox County for his crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| But you know, this is the same police department that continues to tell us we're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| This is the same police department that brought in a police of chief under lying pretenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| This is the same police department that chose the police of chief from the worst police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| department in America, known as the New Orleans Police Department in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| And yet we're getting ready to give $25,000 through this department to another police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| department, which I have to assume is corrupted too, because why would you want to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| or even attached to a fellow corrupted department unless you're corrupted yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| So shout out to the District Attorney of Virginia for having the real integrity of what it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| to back the blue, which means it stands with honor, it stands with integrity, it stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| with truthfulness, it stands with trustworthiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| And instead of being in Knoxville where they do nothing but lie, cover up, murder children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| in high schools, run around our streets, committing additional crimes with their cop cars, unmarked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| spending millions of our dollars, and we get nothing in return except blame-bearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| excuses and self-defense analogies that supposedly are supposed to make us believe and trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Have you been paying attention to these Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| They put cameras on MLK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| But here's the irony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Wasn't it the white man out in West Knoxville that killed the cop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Then where's the cameras in West Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Why are you on the east side with those cameras in the black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| We didn't kill nobody, but they sure did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| So what you watching our communities for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Let's not forget the real-time crime center still trying to get answers today on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| that purpose is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| What is it doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| What is the data for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Who are you actually watching this with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Because as far as I'm concerned, the real criminals of our streets is KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| Where's the cameras watching them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Where's the police oversight of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Who's making sure y'all not committing crimes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| Because y'all got rapists, y'all got child abusers, y'all got murderers, y'all got liars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| thieves, and stealers all through the department, and yet today, Brooklyn Bell, cannot forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| her, the no racial discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| And this council has said nothing about it today, has not addressed the racism, has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| addressed the discrimination, has not even brought a single P on what was the final result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| and outcome of Brooklyn Bell's no public racism that she received when she got emails on her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| work email telling her, nigga, leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| What is this really about, Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| What are you all really doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| How is he any better than Chief Thomas at this point, Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| I'm really asking the real questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| What makes him better than Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Because at this point, I can't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| But you know, let me remind the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| See, this is the difference between me and India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| This is why I ran for power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| Because what I would have done is, one, I wouldn't have hired no liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Two, I would have not kept anyone on our payroll that's a child predator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| Three, a black woman would have felt protected when she told me she was receiving racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| through our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| And number four, I would have never visited Israel and never condoned the behavior of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| Israel's police department that is known for training American police departments who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| directly recognize black communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| So you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| This is why I say, pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Because we do have an option now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| We can reconvote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Did you know about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| We can reconvote India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Because the mayor holds the entire control of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| The council ain't got to say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| It's that mayor's seat that has to say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| So if you're serious right now, let's watch what India does when it comes to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| Let's watch what India does when it comes to Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Let's watch what India does when it comes to black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Let's watch what India does when it comes to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| And if she does not show up in 12 months, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| We're going to recall her right up out of here once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| So keep it real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| What we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| It's that time at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| No longer tolerating your inefficiency and your lack of capabilities or your no complacency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| and incompetence will be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3737)|

| 1:04:23| First person to speak in favor of this item is Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3863)|
| 1:04:33| Mr. Durham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Dustin Durham, I live in Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3874)|
| 1:04:53| I would like to say that I am speaking as a citizen, as a renter, and also as the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| director of a new non-profit called Yes Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| We stand for more choices and freedom in the areas of housing, transportation, and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| So let me say, I appreciate what the city is doing with Missing Middle, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| that the initial proposal was a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| I spoke in favor of it at the planning commission, but since it was delayed for two months, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| think that's just a chance for us to make it even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| So one of the things with this resolution, the reason I support it, is that if the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3928)|
| 1:05:35| for this is already traditional neighborhoods where there are sidewalks, there's walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| if you look at these areas, there's actually more parcels that are Rn1 than there are Rn3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| So if we're really trying to tackle this housing crisis and allow multifamily, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| illogical that we would exclude a zoning type that has more empty parcels than a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| type that is already included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| Another thing to highlight is that this is not a proposal to allow Missing Middle in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| Rn1 citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| It is just in this existing area that the consultants have identified as being prime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| for Missing Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Also, there's no difference substantially between Rn1 and Rn2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| Rn1 already allows duplexes, you just have to spend extra money getting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| It's actually kind of absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| So if we're allowing Rn2 to have Missing Middle, there's no reason to allow Rn1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| The reality is that we cannot keep excluding renters like myself who have no desire or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| money to live in a single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Continuing to allow zoning that excludes multifamily housing types by right, even if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| that's just a duplex, it does not take into account the 50% of people in this city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| are renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| We are the majority statistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| And the 40% of us that are singles like myself who do not have, again, the desire or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| money to own a single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Our zoning affects our housing stock and our housing stock should reflect the preferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| of the people in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Some 80% of people under 45 and over half of people over 65 want the option of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| in a non-single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| If we truly care about the housing crisis in Knoxville, we will let this city develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| in a way that matches our existing preferences and not those from the 1950s, which treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| a single family home as the only viable housing type for an adult to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| Lastly, I often hear the argument of neighborhood character thrown around in regards to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| But from my perspective, the character of a neighborhood is the inclusivity of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| living there and the opportunities the housing provides to live a comfortable life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| By restricting multifamily housing out of RN1, we make our neighborhoods more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| and we make renters like myself that don't desire or have the money to afford a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| family home in large swaths of our city feel unwelcome in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| This resolution, again, does not address RN1 citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| It only addresses some, I believe, 51 parcels that are already in these areas that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| been dictated as being able to have multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| I'll also say that as a commissioner on the Transportation Authority, I'm very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| with what we're doing with our buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| We're about to get 15-minute service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| We're going to have service on Sundays like you've never seen before because, quite literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| we barely have any right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| If transit is going to work for the people of this city, we have to have higher densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Density is not a four-letter curse word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Density can be something as simple as two homes that are attached together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| Again, I love what the city is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| I appreciate what the mayor and the staff have done with Missing Mental, but I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| we have a prime chance to continue to make it better and make sure voices of folks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| me who are renters who have been here for 15 years in this city and who love and care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| about this city to have the same rights and the same hopes as people who own homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4155)|

| 1:09:42| I'm speaking in support of the resolution, echoing what Dustin says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| I believe that housing is a human right, and therefore every effort that we make to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| housing supply and utilize our land more efficiently and sustainably, even a small incremental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| progressive reform like this, like Dustin said, 51 parcels, is a move toward expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| housing accessibility to more people and the basic need of shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| I wanted to talk specifically about the RN1 issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| As some of you know, I knock on doors to try to get people to turn out for elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| That takes me everywhere in the city, dents and low dents and everywhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| Something that you can feel when you're walking around some RN1 neighborhoods is that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| feel like they have purchased their way into an exclusive place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| They've bought their way into not engaging with their neighbors, not engaging with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| community, and in my case, not engaging with politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| I think that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| We shouldn't prioritize those people's needs above everybody else's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| Just because you bought a home in a single family exclusionary zone does not mean you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| get to control the land use of your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| Homeowners are not somehow superior to renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| People who live in single family houses should not have their opinions privileged above those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| who live in apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| I believe in welcoming all neighbors, full stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| RN1 districts are not sacred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| Ownership status, wealth and age, which we know people who live in RN1 are older than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4286)|

| 1:12:24| First of all, I want to say thank you for the time and for the work that you all are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| doing and the debate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| I'm grateful to be here to hear everyone be able to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Thank you for the words that were said earlier from everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| I'm proud to be able to experience this and be in a place that allows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| I'll start with that and then this will be kind of a prepared speech in behalf and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| favor of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| I'm speaking as a resident of Oakwood Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| My name is Caleb Fristo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| I live in one of the traditional neighborhood residential areas, the TDRs, that are included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| in the missing middle proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| As a longtime resident of Knoxville, my family and I understand the tension between our specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| historical experience and the growing needs of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| While we have reservations about the missing middle proposal, we are open to the varied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| and diverse types of housing and people that may soon join our community and become our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| However, we insist that any proposal to have a positive long-term effect must provide additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4406)|
| 1:13:34| infrastructure and must accompany support to those who end up taking residence within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| We oppose the exemption of specific neighborhoods, many of whom have the necessary infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| to accompany such growth, such as sidewalks for walkability, adequate bus routes, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4427)|
| 1:13:57| from participating in the same changes the neighborhoods all around this community are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| expected to embrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| We oppose class-based gerrymandering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| If the city seeks to be more welcoming to new forms of housing and to those who inhabit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| it, the size of one's yard should not be the deciding factor of inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| Simply put, if all are in two neighborhoods in the TDR area are being asked to welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| this change, we ask that all in one neighborhood join us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| The accommodations and sacrifices that accompany growth and that have led not only to the flourishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| of Knoxville should be equally asked of all Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| I lend my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| The first person signed up to speak against item 11-J is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4487)|
| 1:14:56| Mr. Roach, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| He's not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| The second person signed up to speak in opposition to 11-J is Ms. Everey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4502)|
| 1:15:10| Okay, so, Tommy, man, we had a whole conversation about this, and I'm going to be honest with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4510)|
| 1:15:19| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| I'm disappointed because it's missing teeth, lots of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| You know, when we spoke, I told you directly that if you wanted me to take sincerely Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| being serious about housing, I wanted to see things like community land trust in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| I wanted to see things like slumlord control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| I wanted to see things like what you got now right of council coming directly from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| the state, but there were still other things that you all could have done, and we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| seeing real teeth to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| More importantly, let's give Ms. Parker her roses and thank her for getting reelected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| real quick because we need her right now because my question is, we need her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| My question is, this is still a hijacking of her ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Like Nikki said earlier, she had been dropped this concept months ago, and it's ironic how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| you all, as always, ridiculed her, scrutinized her concept as if somehow it was incredible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| and then like Andrew did with Hart, you're technically doing the same thing with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| housing initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| So, that's why I said thank Amelia Parker for reelection because my question is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| had she not won, who was y'all going to get y'all ideals from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| I know not amongst yourselves who we're going to get it from, so where was you going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| get it from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| And that's the irony, is that this woman won a national award for housing and homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| advocacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| So, her name should be on everything when it comes to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| And more importantly, a verbal commitment is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| It needs to be in writing that these landlords will commit to these reductions of rent or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| freezing of rent because they are taking a deal with you all on TIFs, TAS, and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| Because let me give you a quick reminder of how we've been given a verbal commitment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| it blew up in our faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Randy Boyd said, hey, Knoxville, if you pay for the baseball stadium, I promise you, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| won't charge you any more overhead costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Then let's fast forward to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Hey, Knoxville, I've got to give you all a $20 million loan for overhead costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| See how that backfired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| That's why we can't take verbal commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| We need things in writing, Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| So, let's take this initiative back because I'm going to have to request someone drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| an amendment at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| An amendment is that we need to revise these particular resolutions to add number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| community land trust options, number two, slumlord controls, and number three, commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| in writing to the landlords to freeze the rents due to the TIFs, TAS, and pilots incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| that you are offering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| That needs to go in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| That's how we know it's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| That's how we know we're making a commitment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Because I cannot forget Tim Hill, who is the board of the Planning Commission, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| told us at the first middle housing meeting that this ideal that the city was offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| was unrealistic and it was not going to pass through his actual legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| So that's the part we've got to keep in mind, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| The board told us directly this is not going to happen for several various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| And so at this point, I'm still not convinced, Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| I'm not convinced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| I have not seen the teeth to the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| And we need teeth, because Knoxville, you've shown your credibility, and it cannot be trusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| in any of its format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Like I said, the bridge, the baseball stadium, those projects that have unfolded with Walter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| P and the Austin homes communities and those displaced neighborhoods today, those are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| problems that are still dealing with currently in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| And so this is why I said that I like where we're starting, but we are nowhere near the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| And again, Councilwoman Parker should be taken serious to her ideals and her instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| because she is the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| She has been the ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| And you all, instead of hijacking her, need to listen to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| And I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Council, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| People have signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| There's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| In addition to item 11E, there's a lot we can do, and we're going to chip away at housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4743)|
| 1:19:15| as fast as we possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| We're behind, but I took a thoughtful view of all of the comments that I've heard over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| the past few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| And I took a look at the code and thought, what do we have ongoing that we can make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4764)|
| 1:19:31| we add as much housing potential as possible while preserving the neighborhoods that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| all care about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| These next two resolutions particularly are in support of renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And so my goal is to give access to all residential neighborhoods, as one of the speakers mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| earlier, opportunities for renters to offset increasing housing costs, and urgent action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| where possible to stabilize rental options with existing housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| I think the NOAA resolution earlier is going to take some time, but I think it's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| I think we're all aware of the missing middle strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| I think that it has potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| I think there's promise there, and I think we should all kind of, we'll all reconvene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| on that when it comes back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| I would simply ask that we include R and 1 for planning's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| They're discussing this recommendation in December, and I don't think there's any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| to exclude R and 1 from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| I think some of the speakers already mentioned that there's a TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| We're all familiar with that area, and there's no reason to exclude any of the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| neighborhoods in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| I think one of the speakers earlier mentioned that R and 1 provides more housing availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4841)|
| 1:20:48| than R and 3 and R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| I think that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| There's no principal use difference between R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| This shouldn't be a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| I mentioned this in detail at our last workshop, and I think that we should have planning consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| this with the rest of the missing middle strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| I've asked Mr. Johnson to hand out a graphic of the TDR area that you're all familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| I don't know if we can pull it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Essentially, for those of you that are new to this, the yellow areas are the areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| are being considered for missing middle housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| With lack of graphical skills, I circled and read the R and 1 neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| As you can see, these areas have been designated walkable, close to public transit, and good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| spaces for additional housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| Again, firmly believe that if R and 2 neighborhoods are willing to add duplexes, triplexes, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| fourplexes that R and 1 neighborhoods should be as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| You can see they stick out like red thumbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| Sore thumbs is maybe not the right one, but I just think that R and 1 is very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| to R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| The only difference is lot size, and I sure would like to include it in all the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| availability options so that renters particularly who are most likely to want to live in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| neighborhoods save money to buy homes, or maybe never buy homes, but at least be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| to have options for access to these wonderful neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| I guess I'll just close by saying this, and I'll kind of pause for questions or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| The missing middle proposal is inclusive in nature, and I don't think we should start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| with that with some exclusion built in, and so that's why I'm asking for all of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| to have access to R and 1 just the same way they do other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| With that, I'll yield to some questions my colleagues might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| I appreciate Councilmember Smith bringing this and his thoughtfulness in his rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4969)|
| 1:22:57| for bringing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| I guess I have a question based on the comments that you just made and that the speakers made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| and that is, is this resolution talking about R and 1 citywide, or is it talking about in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| the TDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| Because your comments just then made it sound like it was citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| The speakers made it sound like it was in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| When I read the Section 1, it just talks about R and 1 zone districts, and so could you offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5004)|
| 1:23:33| some clarity on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Yes, just within the TDR associated with the missing middle proposal, so not citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| The proposal that's going before Planning Commission only includes TDR, and that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| I'm referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| I really appreciate you clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Would you, since the language in Section 1 is not really, I think it could be misread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| would you be willing to accept a friendly amendment to add in after districts within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| the TDR area, and then it would continue as a part of the missing middle housing proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| Yes, he's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| I'll make that a motion as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| Wait, we've got to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| The motion, there's a motion to amend as described by Vice Mayor Roberto has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| and seconded by Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Are there any questions about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| No questions about the amendment, then all those in favor of this amendment, please say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| The amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| I appreciate Council Member Smith for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| I think the thing that I wanted to talk about in the little bit of time I have left here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| is again, this is about supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| I don't have a problem with planning, looking into whether or not within the TDR, looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5101)|
| 1:25:09| at the R and 1 opportunities there, whether or not that would be a helpful thing for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| Director Brooks, it is my understanding, though, that within the target as it is seen in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5117)|
| 1:25:25| missing middle proposal, there are 51 properties that would be in the R and 1 that we'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5125)|
| 1:25:34| adding on because of this, if we were to make this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| Keeping in mind this is just a resolution for you to look at, but if this change came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| to fruition, is that correct, there would only be about 51 properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| There are 51 vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| And since the missing middle is targeting not conversions, but looking at vacant properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| we're really talking about an addition of about 51 properties by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| The current version...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| If you could speak into the microphone and just say for the audience who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| Amy Brooks, Knox-Wilnox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| The current version of the missing middle housing proposal does include a section on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Well, but you just identified 51 properties, and when we had our workshop on this, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| discussion was a lot about vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| So the target for missing middle is about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| You would add 51 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| There's 51 vacant properties zoned R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| That is not necessarily a problem that we're adding some properties, but I think overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| what we've got to be looking at is where are we going to be making sizable impacts to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| with supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| We're seeing folks dealing with, and the discussion that I had with Director DeBose earlier, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| issues we have are with supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| And if we don't increase supply in a meaningful way, then we're not really going to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| the issues that we're hearing from people about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| And so we've got to look at dealing with that and where we can address supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| And I think, again, that's along the corridors where we have the greatest opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| We should do all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| We should address the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| We should address missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| We should throw everything we can at this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| The other thing that I think is really great, and I really appreciate the speakers for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| highlighting this, was discussion about infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| Wherever we put these things, we've got to consider infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| If we don't have infrastructure to support the missing middle, it's not going to be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| So we need to make sure we're looking at infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| So saying this passes in its amended form, what I would suggest for planning to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| make sure that in R and 1 we have the infrastructure to support missing middle if you are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto, Councilmember Parkers, and Councilmember Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5285)|
| 1:28:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| So there are 51 vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| For the occupied properties, the zoning on those properties would not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5301)|
| 1:28:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| So the zoning wouldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| For the missing middle housing proposal, your zoning isn't going to change unless you request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| it as a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| The middle housing proposal is an option for property owners to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| It's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5327)|
| 1:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| A few concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| One, just to address that one concern, is that we are talking about what the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| of the program is, but we're not talking about what the actual implications of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| change could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| So as a program, we may be focused on the vacant properties, but as a policy change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5362)|
| 1:29:32| any property in the TDR would be able to apply for a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| A property owner can request a change in their zoning at any time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5380)|
| 1:29:48| And this would be allowed zoning uses in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5388)|
| 1:29:56| We're expanding the uses possible in the TDR that properties can then change their zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5396)|
| 1:30:07| to, whether occupied or vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| So if the middle housing proposal were to go forward, it expands the types of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| that may be permitted in a particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| Types of housing, not uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| So I have a lot of concerns about this proposal because, again, I have to go back to the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5428)|
| 1:30:45| Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| We're not learning lessons from the South Waterfront, and we're not listening to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| residents of the South Waterfront on the changes that were made to our form-based code, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| is coming up in a little bit, and how that impacted, essentially, the R and 1 neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| along the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| And we're moving full steam ahead to do this to other neighborhoods through a very confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| conversation where I feel like we're confusing the community on how much this will impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| a certain neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| I'm very uncomfortable with how unclear these conversations have been around Missing Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5482)|
| 1:31:31| What gave me pause around the R and 1 discussion was that the proposal before us was to pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5491)|
| 1:31:45| a program as recommended by consultants in a smaller footprint area so that we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| on top of it as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| We don't have infrastructure needs that we're not able to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| We don't have code enforcement needs that we don't have the capacity to address as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5519)|
| 1:32:07| are increasing density in a way that we haven't done before in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| And with the R and 1 lots, we know those are larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| I don't know what all of these lots look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| I can't say whether this is a walkable area or not, or whether it fits into the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5538)|
| 1:32:28| idea, not that I'm a super fan of the original idea either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5548)|
| 1:32:40| I could support sending this to planning, but I'm concerned to send it to planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5560)|
| 1:32:48| to be honest, because I don't know if we will get the infrastructure study that I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5568)|
| 1:33:00| mentioned and all of the details needed to move forward with a plan like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5580)|
| 1:33:10| So I'm a little undecided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| There just are so many confusing aspects to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| And then the main piece of it is that this is all separate from the incentive programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5596)|
| 1:33:24| This could move forward and only produce market rate housing, and only drive gentrification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5604)|
| 1:33:33| and not actually produce any more affordable units in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Ms. Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| I've got to find my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| So I, too, have concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| I understand the intent is 51 lots, but once you say, by right, this is available to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5631)|
| 1:34:02| lot in RN1 in the TDR, that means any house can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| The intent could be vacant lots, but people could tear down houses, build two, build whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5649)|
| 1:34:18| new structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| I appreciate the intent of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| I think this is a little too soon when we haven't even done the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5664)|
| 1:34:32| for the missing middle proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| So I think I agree with Ms. Parker in the sense that this is a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5676)|
| 1:34:44| We haven't done any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| If we want to study it, we can study it, but that doesn't mean I will support it when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| comes back because I think it's a massive zoning change that to imply it will only impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5693)|
| 1:35:06| 51 lots in the TDR is misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| It impacts every lot in the TDR that is RN1, and that could have a massive change in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5709)|
| 1:35:19| way neighborhoods look in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| So I appreciate the intent, but I don't think I can even support sending it to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5722)|
| 1:35:29| because they have a huge scope of work already to be done, and I'm not sure that this needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| to be added as a priority on their workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| I don't know if this is something that can be determined or just out of curiosity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| the vacant lots, and I don't know if this is a question for Director Brooks or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5753)|
| 1:36:01| Ms. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| What of these lots do we know are a part of any active HOAs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| I don't have that information readily available, but that's something that we could look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| I would just be curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| I mean, I do, listen, I very much support housing, diversity in housing, but I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5782)|
| 1:36:33| that this becomes far more monumental than just focusing on the 51 vacant lots and agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5793)|
| 1:36:43| that the initial proposal that's, while I'd like to see certain parts of it expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5803)|
| 1:36:50| I'm not entirely comfortable with this, although I appreciate the spirit and the thoughtfulness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| that's gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| I would love to know, though, again, HOAs can dictate what their neighborhoods look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5817)|
| 1:37:05| like within their covenants, and that may or may not impact the ability for these vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5825)|
| 1:37:13| lots or other R and 1 neighborhoods within the TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| I would just be curious on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5840)|
| 1:37:27| I'll toss that out there, and I would love for Ms. Sharp or Director Brooks to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| to share that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| Ms. Sharp, do you happen to have that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Debbie Sharp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Debbie Sharp, I'm sorry, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| I don't think she would have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| The Office of Neighborhood Empowerment doesn't keep track of where the HOAs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| Ms. Brooks, do you have any information on that, or can you get back to council later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| by email, or is that something that planning has information on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| I mean, it's not a land use thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| No, we don't track HOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| HOAs are private property things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| We don't have an inventory of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| Council Member Ryder or Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| I'm not sure who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Okay, Council Member Ryder and then Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| I don't think I was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| I think as the maker of this motion, he wanted to hear from his colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Can I have Council Member Singh go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| What I hear with this is a whole lot of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| If this happens, then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| If we start doing this, then there's the domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| These are all fears of what could happen, whereas at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| we have a reality of what is happening, and that's a housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| I agree that we need to be careful about how it unfolds as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| incentivizing to keep it from being market rate, just luxury houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| or, yeah, market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| That is very important, but the part of this treatment of R and 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| as sacred space when we have such a need right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5967)|
| 1:39:36| that's why I signed on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| A list of addresses would be helpful versus a tiny map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| because I am very challenged trying to figure out where some of these places are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| I can say some of them look like random circles in the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6000)|
| 1:40:07| and I would also question ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| I would say that I would support having Planning Commission look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| because I have to wonder if a few of these aren't spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| although I cannot find an R and 1 to match with this red circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| I just want to point that out, but over here, yes, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| I'll help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| I would love a list of what these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| My question to the Planning Commission, Ms. Brooks, would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| is it possible ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Quite often, sometimes things get up-zoned or down-zoned by Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| by the Council District Rep, by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| I think some of these may not be accurately zoned R and 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| because R and 1 is LDR, which is another sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| It doesn't match with TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that there are R and 1s in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| I would support the request to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| is it accurate that these should be R and 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| Let me just say, during recode, there were large swaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| Everything got rezoned in a map process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| and the bulk of the effort went into the text of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| not into the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| No dig at the staff for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| I'm just saying, in the two-year process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| that's where the time crunch ended up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| In some places, some things just got zoned ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| Everything on one corridor got zoned one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| whether they were similar or not, or whether they matched the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| We've had that conversation around CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| and some of our corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| so I would challenge as to whether some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| should actually be R and 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| and that would be my curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| and having them look at that as part of TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| and part of what is being considered at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Council Member Fugate and Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| Mr. Frost, this may be a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Well, it is a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson, either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| if you want to put in your zoning law hat for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| I appreciate what Councilwoman Singh was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| about the desire to limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| The intent of this is to make it affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| but there's nothing we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| unless the city provides some sort of incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| tied to a housing project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| to restrict the cost or rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| or anything that is done with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Briefly, that's correct, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| If the property is zoned, there's no way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| I mean, it's up to the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| how they wish to develop or leave fallow their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| So, doing this, if we made this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| to benefit the missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| there is nothing that says it would stay affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| There's nothing you could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| because it would be arbitrary and capricious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| to mess with somebody's random property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| unless they were to get some sort of subsidized financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| that required it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Sorry, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| Yes, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| If I may, I'll take a pass at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Okay, you've been waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| I want to clarify a couple things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| just to make sure I don't want to overcomplicate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| So, there's a missing middle proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| that's been sent to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| I'm suggesting we include R and 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| because they shouldn't be excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| They're obviously in a TDR designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| I'll help with the list of properties later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| but that yellow area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| is what the missing middle proposal includes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| And what I'm suggesting is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| for the people who are of modest income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| renters, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| those R and 1 properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| are no less transit-oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| or pedestrian-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| than their adjacent R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| and R and 3 neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| I don't know where the 51 number came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| I don't want to overcomplicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| That's not what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| whether there's an empty lot or a full lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| All I'm saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| if we're going to have an inclusive strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| be reviewed by Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| then it should be inclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| so people don't have access to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| at least for the consideration at Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| We're not talking about incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| We're not evaluating or debating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| the overall missing middle strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| or whether it comes back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| and what pieces and parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| What I'm suggesting is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| if the TDR area is good for a medium-sized lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| or a resident that lives there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| or a renter that lives there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| it's good enough for a bigger lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| We shouldn't exclude folks from neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| based on the size of the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| That's what I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| I'll remind this Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| I think it was unanimous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| but we included RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| in a recommendation for duplexes by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| I'll think unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| There were no questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| whether there were 51 or 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| or what many properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| We just said that those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| should allow for this type of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| What I'm suggesting is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Planning and Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| consider this as part of the overall study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| that they're going to do in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| which is why I wanted to bring it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| from their perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| on their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| I hope that clarifies if you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| This question is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| either Council Member Smith or Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| When we look to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| it's really hard to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| even on this paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| but it looks like those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| are adjacent to West Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| and they seem to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| a bigger proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| Are we looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| because of the size of those circles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| that there are more vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| or bigger acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Just the area of land is bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| Not necessarily the lots per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| but just a bigger yellow area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| on a map to draw a circle around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| That would potentially be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| available for the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| to have the various types of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| that could be missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| Again, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| the majority of the missing middle proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| I think over 70%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| is R and 2 neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| If R and 2 neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| are the exact same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| as R and 1 neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| except for the lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| there's no other characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| that are different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| why would we intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| exclude R and 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| That's an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| I also want to go back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| and I know you've said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| but even with this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| and however it comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| we as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| we have no authority to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| how much these rents will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| For any of the missing middle proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| this one, R and 2, R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| R and 4, incentives, regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| none of that is related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| I wanted to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| why should we preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| some single family properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| As was brought up, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| by Council Member Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| at the previous meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| we are initially targeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| areas of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| that do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| the political power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| of other parts of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| They're not as organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| as other parts of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| They haven't shown up to these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| as we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| And it's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| the housing prices all over the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| are increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| but more slowly in some parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| of the city than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| And so I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| yes, there are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| who have no interest in buying a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| but there are lots of folks who are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| I have a tenant in my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| who wants to buy a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| And I believe to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| a healthy housing market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| we also need affordable houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| that people can buy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| We don't want our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| to become one big investment property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| for investors to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| and just build and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| and build and build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| And we don't have local people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| who own their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| There's no way I would get behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| Now, the idea that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| as a country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| put too much of our wealth-building strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| into property ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| is that problematic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Are we going to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| as a city today or tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| How do we remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| those opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| for folks in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| And these are the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| because my house that I bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| my one and only house that I bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| is one street away from this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| in that whole missing middle TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| And it wasn't in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| I wanted to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| I wanted to be in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| I thought it would be affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| when I came back from law school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| I looked in the Park Ridge neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| I looked in Park City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| I looked all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| I could not afford those houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| So I looked further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| outside of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| and I found a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| for me with my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| debt coming out of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| which has been forgiven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| I'm celebrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| Anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| it had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| a $100,000 mortgage for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| So what folks are doing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| they're not buying houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| because who can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| these $300,000 houses on the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| So we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| provide more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| rental options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| and we can create policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| to help further that in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| but we have to have affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| home ownership options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| If we can't do that in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| and we can't start going into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| these lower income neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| putting policy in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| that's just going to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| gentrification in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| where we haven't seen it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| Just a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| could you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| help everybody understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| duplexes, quadplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| sixplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| do those decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| who gets to buy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| Can someone buy a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| that's a duplex for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| Zoning doesn't dictate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| whether or not it's a rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6705)|

| 1:51:57| about we cannot control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6717)|

| 1:52:07| that was affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6727)|

| 1:52:47| that kind of stuck with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| that we're overregulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| some of these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6771)|

| 1:53:24| that they can rent or buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| This is fully intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6806)|

| 1:54:26| the argument I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| coming from the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| is supply and demand is supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| We just need to build, build, build, build, build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| and prices will go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| Well, prices keep going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| It's four years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| I'm serious when I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| the only thing I'm led to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| at this point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| that we are taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| a fiscally conservative approach to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| where we do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| as a government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| want to interfere in the market too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| We're going to give a little incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| When we could be out there competing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| we could be growing our land bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| We could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| actually acquiring properties at a rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| turning that over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| into our Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6907)|

| 1:55:14| property developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| to develop these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| We can actually work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| to intentionally develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| the housing market that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| Or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| we can pretend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| that we have to rely on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| We can pretend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| that we have to rely on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| And our not-so-housing authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| giving money to a bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| rather than acquiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| property for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| It's so simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| It's so simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| It's so frustrating to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| that we're actually pretending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| that the only thing that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| is just open up our zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| invite all the investors in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| to build whatever they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| and hope one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| that that results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| in some affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| for our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| when we actually have tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| that we could be using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| I find it frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| And I don't think it's going to be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| for us long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| But for the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| who just care about the bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| how much tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| are coming into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| and that's all they care about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| it will be fine to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| It will be fine to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| They will be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| with the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| But if we actually want to protect folks right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| if we actually want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| the housing stock that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| we have to take aggressive actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7005)|
