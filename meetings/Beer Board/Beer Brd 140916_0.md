| 0:01:01| you'll need to come to the business tax office to get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=61)|

| 0:01:36| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning from MPC, fire prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=97)|
| 0:01:44| building inspection, health department approvals, and the former permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| Okay, now I understand you're not opening until November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Okay, we'll have plenty of time to get these things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=118)|

| 0:02:00| You have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| I move we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Okay, Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Yes, I was just talking to our counselor, but I noticed that the West Valley Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| or Huntington Learning Center is within 22 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| It apparently is not a school within our definition, but I just wanted to be sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| I've talked to Mr. Frost about that, and he has advised me that it is not a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| It's a retail event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Well, that answers my question, and it tells everyone else the same answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Now we have it in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Are you going to tell us about the pizza place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Yeah, do you want to tell us about Blaze Pizza?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| It's a different concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| So it's a concept from Pasadena, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| We're going to serve artisanal thin and crisp pizza fired in an open hearth stone oven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| You sort of build your own, sort of Chipotle-esque style, and they're all under eight bucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| one size pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| It's going to be a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| And no matter how you slice it, it's good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| And we hope to have many Knoxville locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| Thank you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=194)|

| 0:03:27| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| All those in favor, moving to the heel of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=212)|

| 0:03:55| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=235)|

| 0:03:59| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=242)|

| 0:04:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Yes, it's happening on October 18th, which I know is a weekend that has a lot of stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| However, this is to help people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| We're going to take people from Market Square and down here and encourage them to vote no on Amendment 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| so it has the women to have the rights to what can be done to their own body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| So I just want to get awareness out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Hot Rod Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Hot Rod Incorporated on Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| Councilman Brown, do you know anything about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| I don't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I think they have not been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| About three board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| It doesn't appear that they're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Has anyone, Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| No, I haven't, but I did send her a reminder letter, certified mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| and she did sign the card, the return card that I got back informing her of this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| This is the third time that this group has not appeared before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| They're missing a background and fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| The license holder at that address is the broker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| and it's my understanding that the TABC application has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| So we have some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| We can defer it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| We can have no motion, which means they'll need to start over, or we can deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| So any discussion on those options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| I will not make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| You will not make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Does anyone want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| Going once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Which lets it go to sleep, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Hearing no motion, this matter is now closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Next is the Hurricane Grill and Wings on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| Kareem Boghani, 708 Melford Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| The other owner, Safan Sadis, has not been in for fingerprints or the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| We need building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| This is in Councilman Greaves' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| When are they planning to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| First week of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| So we can postpone this until everything's in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Well, I move we postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Okay, second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Do you understand that the other owner must come in and take the task class and get the records checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| because this body does not approve permits until that occurs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| According to my understanding, his fingerprints have already been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| And he doesn't need to take a task class because I've already taken the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| The task requirement has been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| Depending on how long ago the fingerprints were taken, we may or may not have them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| If the business is no longer active, then we wouldn't have the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| And according to my assistant, we need his fingerprints and the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| So we'll get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Now, one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| If by any chance, if we are ready by the 20th of October, then, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| The 28th of October will be the next beer board meeting when we'll consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| This beer board meets once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| The restaurant can open, but you won't be able to legally serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Would it not be any way possible you could approve it contingent on me getting everything else done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| you know, building, fire, and everything else done before the next beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| We don't have enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| I think that part's an option, but is the issue the Mr. Sedis, however he's pronounced, I apologize, he's not been in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=496)|
| 0:08:28| Well, if his fingerprints are not done before the next beer board meeting, of course it won't get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| But if they are done within the next week or two, then, you know, if we meet all the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| then, you know, we cannot kind of open the restaurant without having the beer permit because it's got bar and grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| So, you know, it kind of killed the purpose of, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Well, October 28th would come before your November opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| so you would, if everything's done by that date, you would have the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Now, this is just in case, you know, if the construction, I thought, might take a week or two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| But if it's done before 28th of October, you know, would you guys please consider doing it contingent on meeting all the requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=545)|
| 0:09:14| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| No, I think it's really important that we at least follow the fingerprinting and background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| To me, that's extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=565)|

| 0:21:03| And I can actually open by October 1st and have the rest of my stuff finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| Well, I understand that that may be what you're wanting to do, but we require on the beer board that you have completed the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1273)|

| 0:23:38| We'll need, then, a motion to defer this to October 28th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| No, not defer, just an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1421)|

| 0:23:58| To not postpone it, just delay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1438)|

| 0:24:11| We're not going to have a tasting room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1451)|

| 0:24:50| so they're working through that, still want to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| make the investment in the first district, which I appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1493)|

| 0:26:40| We have two administrative hearings tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| The first will be Speed Mart Deli on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| They paid their $500 fine on August the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| and also submitted a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| Curtis Isabel for Speed Mart Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Could you speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| I'm Curtis Isabel for Speed Mart Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| This is Mattel Caliwalla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| I was going to say, I believe last time we were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| the board requested that my client complete the task class again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| and he's done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Sergeant Hunter, anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| So they have complied with our requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Are we satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| They've put in this terminal that they've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| So we need to send this on for further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| We hope to not see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| The next is Latitude 35 on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| I'm Jimmy Buckner, lead partner with Latitude 12773,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| Highwick Circle, Farragut 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Latitude 35 had their permit issued in May 22nd, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| They were cited on February the 3rd, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| December 16th, 2011, administrative hearing was scheduled and postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| They paid a $500 fine, submitted a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| so the beer board took no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| On September 5th, 2013, they were cited again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| There was an administrative hearing sent to suspension and revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| There was a pre-hearing held in front of the hearing officer in April of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| They agreed to an assigned order on July the 14th, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| Their license was suspended for 20 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| They paid a $1,000 fine plus the cost of the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| Then again on August the 23rd, 2014, they were cited for underage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| What are our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Mr. Frost, would you advise us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| This is under Section 4-78C Part 1, the second sale within a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1749)|
| 0:29:20| Much like Speed Mart, Deli that preceded Latitude 35, this board has two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| One is to accept their remedial plan and that ends the matter for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| or the second would be to send them on to a hearing with the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1774)|
| 0:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Yeah, I'd like to hear from the applicant what they're doing different to avoid this happening again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| because it seemed like you had set about to have some corrective action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| but it didn't work, and maybe you could explain how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| My name is Gary Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| I'm the general manager at Latitude 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Latitude 35 is a restaurant, and we know it's a privilege to sell alcohol in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| So the first plan of action that we have is me and Jamie Buckner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| has reached out to people that are teaching the ABC classes like Kim Pouncey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| David Crockett, and this is to get us on scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| We really need scanners to check IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| That's one of our first plan of actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| The second plan of action is to let our employees be more aware of the date of own aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1832)|
| 0:30:41| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Let our employees be aware of the date that we can sell alcohol to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| What we're doing is now, before every shift, a manager on duty goes over the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| The server, bartenders, bar backs all have to sign in with the date that is the correct date to sell alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| before they are allowed to take the tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| We also have born on dates at every bar and at every POS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| which is the system that the employees use to put in food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| And we're also one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| I'm sorry, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| The team huddles on your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| And also, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I got a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Usually our kitchen closes at 11 o'clock on the weekend, and that's when we turn to 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| We found out in the last couple of years that because of that, that is leading to some of our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| So at 9 o'clock, we're changing everything about our service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| At 9 o'clock, we're going 21 and up, not 11 o'clock, not waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| The only way a person is underage that can get in our building after 9 o'clock is if they're with a parent or a guardian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1912)|
| 0:32:00| They don't even get in the door, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| They don't even get in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| We usually allow them to get in the door because we are selling food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| And it's going to be hard, and the customer is not going to like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| but we have to change these plans so we can serve alcohol to the right age people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| and people are not walking our door telling us that we're just going to eat food, and they go straight to the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| So as of last week, we have started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| We actually have a guy that comes in at 8 o'clock, checks everybody's IDs that's on the floor, that's eating dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| and then at 9 o'clock, it's 21 and up, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| We have to turn down people that's groups of five and stuff that are 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| They cannot be in our building because we don't want to put that stress on our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| and I think scanners, when we get them this week, is going to help us out even better, even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Councilman Della Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| I had asked a question, I guess, and I just wanted to find out what they had done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| and what they were doing and how they were changing their practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Well, it seems the last day, if I understand it right, these last two were carded and were still sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| So how is the scanner going to help you on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Well, that was the timing when that individual came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| We had a guy checking IDs at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| but when people come in with their families and say they just want a table, we just sit them at a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| This individual said to our door guy that she just wanted to eat food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| so she was allowed to come in because it was between the hours of 8 and 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Now that will not happen because at 8 o'clock we're checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Nobody can be in our restaurant that's not of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| That's our problem is we were allowing people to come in to eat dinner that is underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| because our kitchen doesn't close until 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| So we're changing that time in so we can get more people that at this certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| at 8 o'clock, it's 21 and up unless you have a guardian with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| What if you're in the middle of your dinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| That's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| In the middle of our dinner we do have stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| We stamp the people that are of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| That's the between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| On their wrist or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Yeah, we do a little stamp because we don't want to offend our guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| because especially with our older guests, they don't want to have stamps on their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| They don't want to have wristbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| So if they're of age of 40 and above, we don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Anybody else that has a drink is ID'd a second time at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| from 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| I have a question for Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| You said it's just like the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Does that mean that we can't consider the two offenses that they had in 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Well, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I meant the last one as in Speedy Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| They had two citations within a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| For this, under the ordinances, I think Sergeant Hunter just simply provided you a greater history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| But what is to be considered is the citation September 5, 2013, and August 23, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| So we can't take into consideration that they've had two other offenses and we can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| We do have the option of accepting this, seeing if it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| and hope that we never see them again under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Or we can send them to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| We still have the administrative hearing option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| He just referenced the Speedy Mart Deli, and I guess that's kind of where I'm hung up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| Well, no, the Speedy Mart Deli had two within a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| And you're saying these do, too, and we can't really consider that they've already been here in 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| That's correct, because they're outside the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| So as Chairwoman Palmer stated, the board can accept their plan, and that's the end of it for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2154)|
| 0:36:04| Or the board, someone can make a motion to send them to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| I'd like to move, if I can, to accept this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| By going to the administrative hearing, give us a rundown of what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| I mean, not councilman, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| Allison Ebertine and the law department will prepare a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| A hearing officer, which is a locally licensed attorney, will be selected to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| And the permit holder will be given the opportunity to respond and have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2201)|
| 0:36:50| Then it will be within the discretion of the hearing officer what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| It could be fine, suspension, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| Or accept their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Things will be amicably worked out without the necessity of going to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| I make a motion we send it on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Before we hear a second on that, Sergeant Hunter has something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Since it hadn't come up, I did want to point out that Latitude 35 just completed a 15-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| of the beer permit in August from previous, I think from the TABC suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2245)|
| 0:37:33| So that suspension was just completed prior to this sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Was that prior to the last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| They've had this last one since they did that 15-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| The last sale was on August 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| After they'd had the 15-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Mr. Frost, you know there's been a lot of change since I first started on the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| but I was under the impression at any given time we could move to a suspension revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| and or the hearing officer, and maybe it's changed since 95,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| but I was under the impression that there were other options other than just what I think I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| Councilman Wallace, how it was explained to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| You sent it to the hearing officer for a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| So it's one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| It's one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| I guess just using different terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I just want to make sure that I understood what we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| What I believe Sergeant Hunter was referring to was a TABC issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| which under the law that recently sunsetted was that when they were suspended for their liquor issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| they had to have a matching beer suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| But, and I'm not necessarily recommending this, just for a point of clarity here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| because this is a pretty serious hearing that we're talking about, case that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| but correct me if I'm wrong at any time during the process, if they have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| if an establishment has one violation, you can send them to a hearing officer or to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| With two violations within a two-year period, they will automatically come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| If they pick up a third violation within a two-year period, they don't come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| They go straight to the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Under one violation, I believe it's a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| It is, but I also understand, according to the law, that with one violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| we could send them directly to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| That has been my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Well, and there's also certain circumstances that are very rarely taken where the chair of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| with consultation with the city law director on an emergency basis, can temporarily suspend a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| That's happened a few years ago, or a number of years ago now, when an officer was hit on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Vice Mayor Pavlis, and then we'll go to Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Well, I'd like to move for a five-minute recess, if I can make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| Is there a second for the five-minute recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Five minutes would bring us back at 645.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2438)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2466)|

| 0:43:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2593)|

| 0:43:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| It seems to me that while this is not a great result in terms of being cited again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2609)|
| 0:43:37| they speak as of September 10th that they're putting in ID scanners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| that they're in essence turning people away at the door if they're not 21 by 9 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| that they're starting to walk through at 8 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| and make sure that everyone's identified as either of age or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| It seems like a somewhat serious attempt to avoid this happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| Now, I'd be inclined to give that a shot and see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| I'm not sure what they're going to do with the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| but I realize that some of my colleagues are saying this is pretty severe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| to have fallen back again so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| But it strikes me that there's a genuine effort at least to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| even if it hurts their business some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I'd be inclined to give them a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| They have been before us three times with remedial plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| and each one has been in good faith that we have not addressed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| I thought there was two, but there's a third one going back to 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| So this is something that the Beer Board takes very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Well, just to Nick's point, I think that might be well and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| He just had served a 15-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| So 15 days to over two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Right, Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| They've gone without serving anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I mean, if that didn't get their attention, I don't know what else will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| And so I think for that reason, and that makes it to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| that makes it a lot different than the one, the Speedy Mart that we just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Is it possible to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| You have no more than five minutes, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| First of all, we respect the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| and there's no intent at our restaurant to do anything illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| We have many practices already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| The last two times our employee, well-trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| we've sent our entire staff to two advanced classes for continuing education on carting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| The past two times, we brought the employee here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| It was a human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| She looked at the cart, as you may be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| We're doing everything that we know how to do within the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| The difference with the scanners is it takes the guesswork out of human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| And believe me, we understand the seriousness of this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| And if you're in our shoes, you want to do everything you can and more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| and we feel that we've done what we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| but we have made an innocent mistake with the young lady here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140916?start=2768)|
