| 0:01:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Once again, I just want to say that Ms. Palmer is sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| She is going to be watching by TV this evening, and she will, if we have any straw votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| she'll call in and also call in if she has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| So let's go ahead and continue with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| And Mr. Williams, are you here with 21st Mortgage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Oh, here he comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| I didn't see you over there, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| You have five minutes, and if you'll state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| My name is Tim Williams, 2028 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=124)|
| 0:02:17| I'm a concerned citizen, really, and just sort of representing the business community on this issue of the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=137)|
| 0:02:26| And first let me say that I have a strong feeling that our uniformed officers especially should have above-average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=146)|
| 0:02:34| benefits because of the risks that they take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| But as a business person in Knoxville, we deal with the same issues of retirement plans for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=158)|
| 0:02:47| And by and large, companies such as ours and most other companies in town have to pay as they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=167)|
| 0:02:57| And they have to know what the cost of the pension is going to be to our companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| And we can't pass it on to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| So most companies, like ours, has a 401K plan that is funded by the employees and then matched by the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=186)|
| 0:03:19| And in our case, our employees can put in up to 50 percent of their pay, so it can be a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| But then the company matches the first 4 percent of their contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| And that is real typical of business today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| That is the way most companies, private companies especially, run their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| And that's what I would urge the city council to do in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| The other thing I want to point out is there's been some notes in the paper that it's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| to retain employees in the city to have above-average benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| And this is no different than the issues that the private industry faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| And, in fact, in private industry, we have to compete with the benefits and services provided by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| So we're a company in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| We have 600 employees just a block from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| And we have to compete in the same employee pool for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| So it really puts business at a disadvantage when the city's providing extremely generous pension benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=266)|
| 0:04:35| and they're not accruing the total cost of those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| And then there's one other issue that I'm concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| and that is the cost of the pension that's put on the backs of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| In reading some of the material that was distributed, the cost or the investment return had been estimated at over 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=292)|
| 0:05:04| And then in a stressed manner, it was estimated at maybe as low as 6.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| Well, I'm in the mortgage business, and we make mortgage loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| And after our service cost and origination cost, we don't have anywhere near 4% return on the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| So how can you reasonably expect to have a 6.5% return on this pension fund for the next 30 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| I mean, if that's a reasonable expectation, the city should borrow all the money it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| and turn it over to these investment managers, and it will fund the pension plan forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| But it's not a reasonable expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| So when you do your actuarial studies, you really should use something, and I would say closer to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| I mean, I'm not the best expert in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| There's better people than me, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| But use something more reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| and I think you'll see that the hole that's got to be filled is going to add closer to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| or $400 to every average homeowner's tax bill in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| I mean, it's a much bigger number than you've been looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| And I just urge you to take another real hard look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| and figure out how you can avoid putting that burden on the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| I was just going to say thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| I apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Traffic coming out of Blount County was rather heavy this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| Rick Zebe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=396)|
| 0:06:47| I hope I said that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| You said it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| That's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| I'm here as a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| We've got an accounting firm that has about 20 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| Could we get your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Rick Zebe, 8501 Barbie Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Like Mr. Williams, we've got a 401K plan, a pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| We match three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| So his benefits are a little richer than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| I think that, in general, that's what you see in the private sector is, at best, three or four percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=447)|
| 0:07:36| And a lot of folks, a lot of businesses have no retirement plan at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| My main point that I want to kind of get across, it's pretty clear from the current plan that we've got this huge shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=462)|
| 0:07:53| And that's caused by the actual market returns being less than the projected market returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| That's what happens or can happen in a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| So when you're looking at these new options, it seems to me, given your actual experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| you can't go with another defined benefit plan and subject the taxpayers to more risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=490)|
| 0:08:18| The hybrid plans have less risk, but they still don't eliminate the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| And a defined contribution plan would eliminate the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| You'd know exactly what the cost would be as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| As I said, most private businesses, I think, have three or four percent pension plans, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| Eight percent is virtually unheard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| So one thing I think that you ought to do, if you do go with a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| is put in place a provision that you can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| Almost all private plans allow for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| Not retroactively, not for the people that are there and the benefits they have, but going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| And I think if we had that provision in the current plan, maybe things wouldn't be quite so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Mr. Zevi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I wonder if I could ask you a question while you're still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Does your accounting firm look at other businesses' benefit plans as part of what you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| In other words, do you have direct experience with looking at people's, you know, their finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| as you help them do taxes and other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Do you see their benefit plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| We also actually have an investment company as part of our accounting firm where we manage people's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| including pension plan money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| And so you're saying, based on what you're seeing in the marketplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| you're seeing defined contribution as the way most people are doing their business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| I can think of a couple clients that used to work for Ford in Michigan that have defined benefit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| But I can't think of anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| And I probably have, well, our firm as a whole probably has 800 tax clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| I don't know of anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Unless they work for, like, UT or the city or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| The government plans tend to have more of that type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| And look at governments around the world, from Greece to California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Look what's happening because of defined benefit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| Well, we call those legacy benefits or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| But they're burdens, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Let me ask you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| I don't see our actuary here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| I think he's coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| He had a schedule, and I should have asked Mr. Williams this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| He had a schedule that showed that the real returns were in the four or five, maybe even six percent range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| There was a second column where he subtracted the cost of administering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| We have people who administer the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| That costs you half a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| So that reduces the return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| And then he added the rate of inflation of two or three percent to get this seven and a half, seven and three quarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| eight percent return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| And I didn't understand why you add inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Do you have the economic or, you know, financial background to explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| Well, I've heard that that's what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| And I don't understand why that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| I don't think it makes sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| If you look at your actual investment returns the past 20 years, I believe it's been 5.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| So he pulls out the real rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| He refracts the cost, but then he adds inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| And I'm trying to figure out, is he paying with future less valuable dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| What is he doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| I guess that's what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| But, you know, look back at that 5.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Is there somewhere you can go to get that extra two or three percent for the inflation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| Can somebody mail it to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| I mean, I don't think it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| So I think you have to look at actual returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| And the fact is, when I do a financial plan, I do a lot of financial planning for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| And probably 15 years ago I used seven or eight percent as the assumed rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| I use five or six now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| And I think six and a half or seven or eight is totally unjustified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| I was hoping that maybe the accounting side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| I know actuaries do some special magic that no one else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| I don't understand the inflation thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| I'd love to hear him explain it because I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I didn't know what the answer to that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Just for clarity, we're meeting Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| Oh, Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| I'll ask him then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Moving on in the agenda, you know, there's been two questions that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| the goal tonight for me anyway is to try to, you know, to whittle away at issues and get to where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=772)|
| 0:13:01| And there's two questions out there that I think that we could answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| And we've talked about straw polls all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| And I want to do that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| And the first one deals with, I'll just read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| The council acknowledges the Blackwell decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| and furthermore we will not pursue changes to vested employees or retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=797)|
| 0:13:26| Now, this is a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| And it's somewhat unofficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| But hopefully, you know, we'll run through this and see where it lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| But I think it's something that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| So, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Are you including new employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| That's the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Oh, that's the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| I'm ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| When you say changes, is there any special definition of that term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| Or just no changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Well, as it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| But, you know, here's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| If I work 25 years and have the right age or 30 years and the right age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| I get a certain percentage of my salary based on my last two years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| And that's my pension going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| If I understand that as the core of the pension, then there are side pieces like, one, cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| How much is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| We've had some discussion with the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Can we ever look at that as a way of them helping us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Is that included in your question or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I mean, in other words, are we talking about the core benefits, which are clearly spelled out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Are we talking about any conditions related in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| I would like to know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Let me call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Well, perhaps that question should be directed to either Rob or Charles Swanson, who's out here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| He's over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| We'll go with Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Well, the first question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| and also Pension Board Attorney Bud Gilbert's here in case he wants to say anything or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| It's really addressing the Blackwell decision that, you know, the gist of the Blackwell decision is once an employee has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=907)|
| 0:15:18| met all the requirements laid out in the pension plan that their benefits cannot be diminished in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=918)|
| 0:15:29| That's the core of the question that's being asked right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| as it pertains to current city employees who are presently vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| and to the current retirees who are receiving benefits under the pension, the various pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=941)|
| 0:15:52| I guess that answers the question, unless Bud Gilbert can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| I read something Bud Gilbert presented to the Pension Task Force where he said unanswered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| and maybe here he can address it, unanswered by Blackwell were things like COLA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| like other aspects that are fringe related to the benefits, but not the benefit itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| and Blackwell just doesn't give any guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| So if you're here, Bud, would you tell us your interpretation of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| since you have been living with pension law longer than any of us have ever touched it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Maybe that's a curse, but, you know, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| this goes back to the part in Blackwell that says actuarial analysis is sort of a sophisticated guess that requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=989)|
| 0:16:39| periodic adjustment, and it's prudent that we recognize that legislatures have to address the cost based on changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=999)|
| 0:16:50| analysis of that target that the actuary comes up with, and that that's something that's open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| And Blackwell also says, if I read it correctly, that employees do not have a guaranteed wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| but employees have a wage that they receive sort of on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| and their tenure with the government is wide open except insofar as civil service has rules that change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1028)|
| 0:17:17| In other words, like every employee in Tennessee or an employee at will, subject to the rules of the civil service thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| there's a cause and everything else before actions can be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| So the question goes back to what is the piece that Blackwell carves out as clearly protected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| And, you know, I understand the age at which you can retire, the rate that they have to pay you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| the years of service that they calculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| That seems to be clearly talked about in Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| What's the piece that's in the fuzzy zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| My name is Bud Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| I'm with Kennerly, Montgomery, and Finley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| We serve as general counsel of the City of Knoxville Pension Board, 550 Main Street, 4th Floor, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1071)|
| 0:18:00| Councilman, that question is a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| I don't know that any lawyer who makes his practice in this area can give you a definitive answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Blackwell is a 1981 Supreme Court decision in the state of Tennessee that dresses a set of facts that grew out of Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1090)|
| 0:18:21| And a pension system where the city council had amended that plan 37 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| They changed the formula by which you calculate the defined benefit that was awarded under that plan to vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1108)|
| 0:18:39| And I guess what they did is they went a little too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| They changed the calculation that had to do with the average annual salary that you use in calculating the defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1123)|
| 0:18:52| And at one time it was a five-year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| And for various reasons they gave employees a choice to either use the highest yearly average or another calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1135)|
| 0:19:04| I guess they found that that cost them a little too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| So they went back a little bit later and they reversed themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| They generated the lawsuit in which the employees brought the suit saying that their vested benefit had been changed or diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| And the Supreme Court of the state of Tennessee ruled in 1981 that indeed it had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| And that particular line of thinking or case has been present in many states across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1166)|
| 0:19:34| And as you can imagine with the —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Pennsylvania rule they call it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| And Tennessee follows a number of states in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| There are other states that hold a different holding in that arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| And it can depend on a lot of different factors that can be at play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| What I'd just say to the Council on this is there are many current decisions working themselves up to the state Supreme Courts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1192)|
| 0:20:01| various states in the nation right now because of the issues that are caused by the lack of funding of defined benefit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| I don't know that anyone can predict what the state of Tennessee's Supreme Court would do if faced with a scenario like you're describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1208)|
| 0:20:17| I think any lawyer worth his or her salt would be duty-bound to tell the client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| at this time we have this Supreme Court decision that was decided in 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| So to the extent we believe that the benefit you're changing is an essential element of that benefit, there's going to be a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| And lawyers are charged with giving advice, as you well know, based on the rulings of our courts and the statutory framework that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1237)|
| 0:20:46| So any lawyer who is doing his or her duty to a client would have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| if you materially alter the benefits of a vested employee of the city of Knoxville, you will invite a Blackwell lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1251)|
| 0:21:00| As to whether the city or the employees would win, I would assume that the court would continue to honor their prior decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| But it may be that we're at such a place that arguments can be made and the court would be convinced otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| I'm not smart enough to figure out what the Supreme Court of Tennessee would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| None of us are, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| And so you'd be fighting about what is a material alteration, in essence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Is that tinkering that's permitted or is that tinkering that's not permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Well, we are seeing different court opinions come down in different states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| For instance, some states are playing with the COLA formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| How much of a COLA do you give in your retired benefit planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| And that has automatically caused some lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| And they're right now in the course of being decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| I believe that there are three states that have pending litigation on that very question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| But just because one state decides it one way, as the lawyers on the panel know, doesn't necessarily mean that Tennessee will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| decide it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| That is a uniquely state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| It's not a federal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| It's not the United States Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| We make our own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| And let me just say, I think there's wisdom in what the mayor has announced thus far, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| that she's chosen not to take on a Blackwell situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| I think there's wisdom in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| And we have been around and around that question, trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| And there's no absolute certainty anywhere other than Pruden says don't touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Now, could I ask you one other question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| We need to move this on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| We've got to move this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I mean, we could debate this all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I wasn't going to debate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| I was going to ask him to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| But we've done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| And I think that at the end of the day, the question is, would we uphold or would we not diminish any of the current plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1369)|
| 0:23:00| It's the core of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Current benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Would you say current benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| I can understand that, and I can vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| And that's what he talked about was benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| I've read Blackwell probably not as many times as Mr. Gilbert has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| You know, I'm of the opinion, you know, the court clearly says an employee follows through with the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| They become vested in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Changes to the plan can occur, but they cannot diminish the benefits that the employee has vested at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1411)|
| 0:23:41| That's the essence of the holding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Nick, can we just get away from Blackburn and just say that we as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| Sunburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Sunburn, Blackburn, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| And just say we as a council are not going to alter the present-day benefits, our retirement benefits of those vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| and non-vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| And forget about Blackburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| I've had enough of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| I think we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| I think we all know where we're going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Well, let's just do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| I mean, I'll adopt his statement of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| If you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| We'll get this behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Do you want to repeat what we're saying so everybody understands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| You repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| If you're changing the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| I'm not changing the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| I'm saying that we as a council will not affect a city of Knoxville employee's present pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1470)|
| 0:24:39| whether vested or non-vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| The vested and non-vested is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| Oh, you want to just say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Yeah, do it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| And retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| And retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| And retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| I think that's even more certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Retirees, I don't think you can touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Oh, we do all three at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| I'll take that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| To do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| I'm agreeable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| One vote for and the 364, 365, whatever that magic number is of those that are not vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| The current employees are not vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| So that everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| So we're clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Do you agree or disagree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Is that the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Vice Mayor, are you talking about vested, non-vested and retirees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| And you're talking about benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And I want that word in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| We're talking about the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| We'll call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| I just want to do a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| And, yes, I recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Council Member Palmer called me a little while ago before the meeting, about 45 minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| regretting that she couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| She definitely wanted to be here, but illness is keeping her away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| She did want me to express publicly her position that she firmly believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| and agrees with the vote that was taken that addressing current retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| current members who are vested in the plan and current employees who are not yet vested that she supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| And retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| And retirees, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| I'll turn it over to Mayor or Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1605)|
| 0:26:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| What we want to do is move very quickly through here and hope what we can do is help focus the discussion from our point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| and then explain some slight changes we've made to the plan that the administration strongly feels is the correct way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1623)|
| 0:27:11| or the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| As you know, we started to receive the report of the pension task force on February the 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| and by March 28th we issued a report to council which displayed five alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| that we thought represented the lay of the land on possible approaches to changing the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| All of those plans involved a reduction in benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| and they varied to the degree that they allowed or apportioned risk between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| and the employee ranging from full defined benefit with all risk on the city to full defined contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| to all risk on the employee and three hybrids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| We think the issue clearly is joined between two competing plans that have had interest and people have spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| So we'd like to suggest that we focus our interest on the hybrid that Mayor Rojero has said that she prefers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| that we're recommending as the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| which is the one that has a $40,000 cap in the defined benefit that an employee would receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| with a defined contribution plan for everything above $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| That, on the other hand, there is also clear interest, and we've heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| and we heard the other day with the defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| So what we would like to put forth is where we think the major issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| and major point of departure between those two is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| and hopefully focus our discussion on what we think the key question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| And that is with the hybrid plan, the city assumes a portion of the market risk clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| That portion up to $40,000 of every employee's salary and does so in exchange for the recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| and retention advantages that come with this and providing the certainty to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| And we would emphasize to uniformed employees in having the defined contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| and defined benefit plan, but to all employees, not limited to uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| You heard from the chiefs the other day on what those advantages were in recruitment, retention, and savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| and not having to continually retrain folks who were going to go out into the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| We think the issue is joined on whether it is worth the benefit enjoyed by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| and having no market risk traded off the benefit of having that ability to have a defined benefit portion for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1767)|
| 0:29:35| especially at the first $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| And, obviously, our position has been and is that it is worth having an assumption of some of that market risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| clearly reduced from what it is now, to provide a portion of their retirement as a defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| We agree and are glad to hear that the recommendations are only for new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| And, obviously, that decision has already been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| We also want to address one other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| We feel that it's very important for the voters to consider a very clear choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| and that is as to what the nature of the pension plan will be for new employees and to close the present plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1811)|
| 0:30:19| And we -- there's been some discussion we want to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| and seeing more of today about taking the pension from the charter and putting it in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| We would strongly suggest that that be tabled for now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| and that we concentrate on preventing the voters with a clear alternative to what the present plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| for a clearly understood vote that avoids ballot confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| We're working on a draft, a ballot-ready draft of the hybrid plan, the mayor's recommended hybrid plan right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1843)|
| 0:30:52| and have the law department working on that, and we'll be ready with that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| I'll emphasize again, this hybrid represents reduction in both benefits and risk from where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| Now, what we've handed you in the table, we handed out around before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| summarizes this plan, I think, and clears away a lot of the brush from many of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| that were presented to you with the five alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| We have made, after discussion with the employees, a couple of adjustments to the plan that we're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| One is a ten-year vesting period rather than a five-year vesting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| This has obvious advantages in the future of giving more discretion to the -- to consideration by future councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1886)|
| 0:31:35| or future voters relative to court decisions, and we don't have to get into any more detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| Otherwise, the other difference that we have is we have moved the retirement age from fire and police from the 57 that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| before you before to 55, and the retirement age for the general government kept at 62, which it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1909)|
| 0:31:57| We had discussed changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| The retirement age is for general government 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Retirement age for fire and police from 57 to 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| Briefly, and I'll go over this very briefly and then turn it over to Mayor O'Hara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| what we're talking about is a divine benefit portion up to $40,000 with a consumer price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| CPI adjustment over time to that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| The yearly retirement benefit for all employees would be 2% times the highest five-year average pay times years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1939)|
| 0:32:28| Retirement age 62 and 55, general government and fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| And overall, a big change is the cost of living is based on consumer price index capped at 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| Presently, it ranges from 3% to 4%, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| We also recommend the defined contribution account for each person with the city contribution being 8% for general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1963)|
| 0:32:53| and 10% for fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| This is of the amount over $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| And the 6% employee contribution throughout that account would accrue that employee contribution over $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| So there's been some slight alteration in the plan that we're still recommending to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| and we urge that the consideration, we hope the consideration can focus on what we think the key question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| and what the key value point is between the two, which is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| the city's assuming some market risk as a tradeoff for having the benefits for recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| and retention and benefits for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| And, Bill, thanks for making that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| It wasn't too many months ago that four of you and I were on the campaign trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| And we were consistently asked, what is our position on pension reform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| And what I consistently said was that my goal would be to reduce risk to taxpayers, future taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2028)|
| 0:33:59| and to remain competitive in terms of our salaries and our benefits to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| It was a balance act, a balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| And that's what I believe we are presenting you with today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| It does reduce the city's risk and our costs going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| But at the same time, and it increases the risk to employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| and they don't have the same risk now and just in this total defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| So what we've tried to do is hit that sort of sweet spot, you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| where we are reducing future liabilities, future costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| but at the same time remaining competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| And you all heard from the police chief and the fire chief last week, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| about what it costs to recruit and to train and to equip our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2090)|
| 0:34:59| and the importance of having that experience when you get to a situation that police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| and fire deal with, you need that expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| And my job as the chief executive of the city is to make sure that, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| that we hold the line on expenses and on risk, and at the same time that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| that we can deliver the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| And public safety is the biggest part, really, of our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| and of our responsibilities, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| And so we need to make sure that we can deliver those kinds of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| And so I'm always struggling with that balance on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| And so that's why, after looking at all the possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| and what other public sector, what other cities in the public sector is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| this is not the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| This is the public sector, and we have unique responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| and services that we offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| And in looking at that, we came up with this stacked variety of a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| And that's why we continue to present it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| and I recommend that you seriously consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| Now, this doesn't make anybody really happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| and that's why I think we're at a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Because the employees, those that are representing future employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| they don't really like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| They would like to have the benefits they have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| And we've met with our employee groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| and I give them a lot of credit because I know the representatives will get a certain amount of heat back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| you know, with their membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| And I give them credit for recognizing that they have to give, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and the future employees will have to give on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| And on the other hand, as you heard from some of the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| they don't think there should be any risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| They don't like this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And so we've got the two sides, and we're trying, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| to find that balance that will address these, you know, both of these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| And I submit to you that that's what we have done in this hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| And so as you all vote on this or decide which way to go, you will hear from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2221)|
| 0:37:10| But this is what we're called upon to do now is to make a decision, to show leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| and try to balance those competing demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| So that's why we continue to put this before you and why I will continue to encourage you to select this method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2237)|
| 0:37:26| this hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| And as has been mentioned, we think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| I'm concerned about ballot confusion in November if there's a lot of different things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| I think a plan like this, I think we can get support for it from both sides of the issue right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2255)|
| 0:37:47| Again, nobody's really happy, but it's the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| And we want my goal is to go in for the, you know, in November without a lot of confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| without a lot of fighting about it, by saying, you know what, this is a good change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| It will meet our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| And hopefully we can get something passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Otherwise, if you come up with something where there's a lot of dissension about and it doesn't pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| then we have the same existing plan, you know, for another two years, adding, you know, to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| And so I'm trying to weigh all of those factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| and that's why I'm bringing this to you and submitting it to you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I guess Bill Lyons must be the one I have to ask this question to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I see several changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| One is you had 57 for the uniformed and you made it 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| Why did you change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| We looked more carefully at other cities and the changes they had made in response to similar conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| and the most went to 55 and not 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| We also discussed at length with representatives of fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| and it seemed that 55 was a reasonable place to go for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| and especially when we were going to increase the vesting to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| So we made that as a judgment after more consultation with uniformed officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| and with a little more looking at what some other large comparable cities were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| And then the second question is on the defined benefit portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| the portion that Mayor O'Hara was talking about that was for the lower income folks up to $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| that was a defined benefit analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| You've added the phrase with CPI adjustment over time, which I interpret to mean it's $40,000 now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| and it's $50,000 in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| That's added and that's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| How do you change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| I thought we were talking about the lower paid employees who couldn't be in a position to afford risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| and now you're saying, well, it's a cost creep thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| We're going to keep going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| So it's really not just the lower end of the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| It keeps growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| Well, people's salaries will be increasing over time, and, of course, there will be inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| 40,000 in 20 years isn't going to mean what it means today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| So we think this point is at a certain point in the pay scale that the CPI will keep relatively stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| and still begin to pull on that lowest portion of employee's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| And, by the way, this was all we may have not been as explicit about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| It was always our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| It wasn't in the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| It would be a CPI inflator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| So I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| But that was always our intention to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| And then if I could ask, I guess, the question, well, the question comes up is how many employees fall on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2431)|
| 0:40:43| of the defined benefit or the combination defined benefit and defined contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| In other words, is that the midpoint in our employee body of 1,600 people, or is that the of course we're talking only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| But where does that sit in the normal sampling of our employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| Those under 40 versus those over 40, I guess, is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| We're going to have Vicki Hanfield address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| She's got the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| I can sort of give you an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| That's going to vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| But just looking at today's information, on average, and just kind of going back and looking at a few years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| it looks like about 35 percent of our employees at retirement would fall below the $40,000 mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| About 35 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| People that are eligible to retire, not what they make today, but what they would make when they retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| That's what the focal point is at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| About 35 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| About 35 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| What does that mean again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| You confuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| When they retire, they're going to be getting $35,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| If you look at eligibility to retire, salary when someone is eligible to retire, about 35 percent of our employees when they retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2501)|
| 0:41:50| will be making below $40,000 as salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Was that your question, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Yeah, I was trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| In other words, we were saying the lower paid employees should have a benefit package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| if I understand the mayor's presentation, such that they don't have this market risk aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| But as people get larger salaries, they would have part defined benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| and part defined contribution without the market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| And so I was trying to figure out, is that a lot of folks on one side of the line or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| Or is that the midpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| I didn't really know where it fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| I guess I understood the question differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| How many currently make $40,000 or less that are active employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| It's probably right around the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| If you just looked at today's salaries, people that aren't eligible to retire at any given time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| our average salary at the city is approximately $41,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| Okay, that's more what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Bill, what does this program that you're looking at, what's it going to cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| What's the projected cost of this versus what we do have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| Well, the graphs that were handed out in the presentation Mr. Pennington made displayed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| This was one of the lower cost plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| It's not, I think the key to that question is that is going to cost us based on 6.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| The estimate is it's going to be, A, much lower than we have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| and fairly close to what the cost for the defined contribution plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| Now, obviously, that is dependent on that assumption as to what the actual cost will be later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| But that is based on the 6.5%, which is what Mr. Pennington recommended using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| The cost will be, well, it was in the earlier handout, it'll cost, you know, each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| But you can see once we get through the unfunded liability and everything kicks back down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| once we have that eliminated, its cost is now comparable to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| And without, actually a little lower, without the market risk of what we have today, but with some market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| So there's some unknown based on the market, less unknown than there is today or with a defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| And really, all the plans, I mean, we're having difficulty because we really don't know what's going to happen with any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| The problem, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| I mean, basically, you have an unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| The unknown falls on the employee and the retiree for the market in the future with a pure defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| That unknown is split with the hybrid and falls all on the city right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| How did you arrive at 8 percent city contribution, 6 percent employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| This was, again, in conjunction with comparison to other cities and Mr. Pennington's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| We did think that to keep comparable the understanding that fire and police would have an earlier retirement date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| That kept consistent with the reduced retirement age and the defined benefit portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| Did you, and I realize what Madeline had said about the difference between government and private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| but did you look at what the normal private is in terms of percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| No, we were used as our base for these when we looked at comparable percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| with comparable cities we're doing facing this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Yes, I just have a general question for, I guess, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| If this plan, this hybrid plan is adopted and we maintain the present pension plan that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2725)|
| 0:45:33| and have this plan for new hires, basically you're saying that the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| as we go to the future, would be sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Once we think the --if you look at the graphs we handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| those levels are substantially less per year than we're paying now even with, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| without having to carry the burden of the built-up obligation to the retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| We're now amortizing that, and it's way higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| We, yes, we think it's definitely sustainable under more reasonable assumptions with less risk borne by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| It is a sustainable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Vice Mayor, could I ask Attorney Gilbert a question, if you don't mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| I'd like to ask you a question if you come back to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| It's a very simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Oh, well, maybe it's not that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| But since you are very knowledgeable about pension plans and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| what is your opinion of this hybrid plan, if you can tell us that, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| Councilman, that's a fair question, but I really defer to the mayor and the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| That is uniquely your province.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| I will add that whatever is proposed will come to the pension board under Charter Section 1355 for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| and the pension board will issue its report as to form and effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| So the board will have a role in giving advice to council on whatever the final proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| I tried to tell you what to do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| I mean, your life is on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| Bill, I guess you're going to get this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Your projected cost, I don't understand if we went with this, why the cost of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| and I guess maybe I don't understand all these charts, goes way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| Is that the combined cost of everything, the current plan plus the new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| And if you want to know, basic reduction is the very top line there is if we kept the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| if you're looking at the graphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| So over time, it goes up less than the current plan, and that's the savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| if you want to look at it, that increment between those two lines is the amount less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| It continues to go up because we're going to be in an overlapping plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| Oh, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| I thought that if we showed the new cost, it would be pretty much a flat line across the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| But I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Okay, so that reflects the total cost of the combined plans, the existing plan plus whatever this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| Well, I will tell you, I'm not real comfortable, and I'm not going to pick at these things individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| I just am not real comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| What happens is it still brings a defined benefit portion, and you know my discomfort with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| and that we cannot know our liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| We don't know our current liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| We know what our actuarial expert has told us, but that's with an assumption of 8% or even 7 3-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2919)|
| 0:48:48| We still don't know our liability, and we can't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| If the market were to do anything close to what it did in 2007 and 2008, I think we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2931)|
| 0:49:02| I'm not sure that the taxpayers, I have trouble going to the taxpayer and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| we need to continue to take all this risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| I'm really uncomfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I think our answer to that is we're not asking the taxpayers to take all this risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| We have had to have limited risk in exchange to take with a lower assumption than we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| Admittedly, 6 1-1 is still healthy, but lower than both we have had that got us here, which is 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| and then the lower 7 to 3-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| What we're presenting is that limited risk we think is worth the benefits you get with recruitment, retention, training, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2972)|
| 0:49:40| I mean, that is a value judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| That is the -.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| You know, that's what we're engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| I guess we might differ on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| The way I see it is we've taken a straw poll to leave alone any current vested and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=2994)|
| 0:50:05| I think we have a decision whether we're going to vote to freeze the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| If we're going to freeze the current plan, then we can look at two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| We can look at a hybrid plan or we can look at a straight, defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And we can take this hybrid plan and we can tweak it more if that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| Or we can talk about what the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| And really, you really need to hear a presentation from someone that knows that's not biased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| My problem is that most of the people that we heard from are extremely biased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| It's their pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| They are benefiting from this plan and will benefit from this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| And that's one of my main concerns about the pension being in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| It's run and it's oversight by people that have a vested interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| And if you could take it outside the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| and then you can modify the people that are on the pension plan to people that are completely non-biased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| that are not, don't have a vote in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| If I vote on something, I can't, there's no way you can tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| that you're completely unbiased when you have a direct benefit to the plan that you're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| and why you should, why it should be an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| And that's why I suggested and I still say that the city council ought to remove themselves from the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| And we ought to take ourselves out of it to remove any and strip away any hint of that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| that we would have any impropriety or an oversight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| But I think if we took a straw poll and you wanted, and everybody wanted to do a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| then we'd take this hybrid plan and we would, and we could tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| We could, you know, I mean, I think it's still a very rich plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| It's still way more than the public's, than what the public's getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| You've heard from two big corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| I've talked to a number of people over this last week, my own company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| I mean, this is way generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| I mean, it's very generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| It's still very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| And I think that's what we've got to balance is competitiveness and affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| And I think those are the two things that we're charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| And this is still a very affordable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| But, I mean, if we're going to, and I don't know, but I think that the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| is whether we want a hybrid plan or whether we want to define a contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| And, you know, I think that's the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| And what information do we need to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| You know, I would say I'll follow up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| I mean, I have no problem coming out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| I mean, I fought it when we went in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| The first eight years or six years that I was on council, I refused it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| And then I was more or less forced into it, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| So I don't have any problem whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I've never seen a part-time job where you've got a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Well, I'm going to move from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Yeah, well, we said the other day, I think we give out more than we actually bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| But I think it just totally removes us from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| And I think if you're going to look at a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| then I'm fine to, you know, to quit talking about whether we should remove the pension out of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| Because then it's really a mute point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| But if we're going to go forward with a hybrid plan that does have defined benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| then I think we're going to stick to, you know, stick to talking about and talk about the merits of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| whether it's confusing on the ballot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| I think it's a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| And I've heard from a lot of people that are really ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| I think there's a lot more people in the public that are upset about this than we might have been led to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I was ñ I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| This gentleman's retired, and he may not want to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| But since Mayor Brown asked Mr. Gill to come forward, Larry Martin's in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| He may not want to, and you can just wave your hand no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| But we were ñ you know, I spoke to Larry personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| And previously, it seems like a very experienced, knowledgeable person in city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Maybe he'd be willing to say a few words about the proposed hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| He doesn't seem to have his track shoes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| He's deferring, I think, at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| You know, like you say, we can alter and tweak this hybrid, proposed hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| You know, I mean, I'm in agreeance that, yes, the city employees, uniformed and un-uniformed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3264)|
| 0:54:32| have a very special role in public safety and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| I still think that in respect to inflation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| automatic raises and cost-of-living increases in an economically volatile world fiscally that we live in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| you know, automatic 3% cost-of-living raise is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| And, again, I don't want to ñ we could sit here and go down each of these categories and look at them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| Maybe we can do that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| And considering that in times of, quote, unquote, high cotton, when things are going well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| we could have a one-time payout for the benefits to retirees and folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| But, you know, painting this benefit plan as an attraction and retention is very pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| I think that it's likely that the city and all its employees, even with just health insurance benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3317)|
| 0:55:25| doesn't have a hard time attracting quality people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| So using this as a tool, although it does attract good people, I think there's a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| if we put out a request for jobs and for ten positions, there'd be a thousand applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| And some of these very educated, quality folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| So, again, I'm not trying to say that this isn't a useful tool for hiring, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| That's just my two cents at the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Councilman Steyer, I don't think you've spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Well, you know, I've come out in favor for a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| and I certainly have the utmost respect for our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| and especially fire and police that put their life on the line to keep our neighborhoods safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| and enforce our laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| And, you know, I really don't want this to turn into something that, you know, we don't appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| But I just feel like, you know, the defined contribution plan, you know, is works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| and that's where the world is moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| You know, I think the hybrid sounds nice, sounds like a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| You know, they want to do what we think is best for the city of Knoxville and the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| You know, I wouldn't be here today if we didn't have this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| I mean, I wouldn't be calling for it to be closed if we didn't have this problem right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| You know, looking at this, you know, we have to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| And some of the things that have been said about the hybrid, you know, in terms of retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| and recruitment, you know, I do agree that it probably helps, but it comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| And it comes at a cost we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| It's a black box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| We have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| I mean, how can we even do a cost-benefit analysis on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| We don't know the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| This same actuary in 2006 sat down with the county government and made projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3432)|
| 0:57:22| Well, those projections were so wrong that it looks like the county is going to close that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| You know, do we want to put a council five or six years from now having to deal with the mess we made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| You know, that's what we're tasked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| And going back to recruitment and retention, you know, the overwhelming majority of organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| profit, nonprofit, many government agencies, quasi-governments, they don't have defined benefit plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| and they're able to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| They're able to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| They don't, you know, I mean, and we may have to do some things in the future to work on retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| if that becomes a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| We may have to look at salaries and raise salaries for those employees that don't have this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| But we know what the cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| And going back to these, going back to the cost issue, I mean, we just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| The county adopted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I think it was supposed to cost around $3 million for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| It's cost $8 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| And that plan was started in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| I mean, these actuaries, and it's not their fault, but they were wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| And they were just dead wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| And I was going to ask Mr. Pennington, you know, when they were sitting in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| Mr. Pennington, I'm sure, told them, you know, it's going to cost this much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| And it was actually on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| It was supposed to be 11 percent of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Pretty soon it's going to be 19 percent of payroll for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| And I don't want to talk too much on the county problem, but it's just an example of how wrong this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| And the hybrid looks like, you know, this nice option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| But what we're doing is starting a new defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| And I want everybody to ask themselves the question, is this what the community wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3539)|
| 0:59:07| Is another defined benefit plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| In my assessment, I don't think they want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| I think they want their services delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| I think they want something that's affordable and predictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| And this is the same conversation that's happened all across this country over the last 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| these plans are difficult to predict what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| And so companies have had to move away from them, and they're bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| I mean, there's states in much, much worse shape than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| So, you know, that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| You know, and I think it goes back, you know, to some basic questions of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| I mean, should we have a plan that places all this risk on taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| And in fairness, should we ask taxpayers to pay for a plan that they don't have access to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| that's completely foreign to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| And three, is it a prudent way to run the city, you know, with such a wildly unpredictable cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| You know, less than a decade ago, it was a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Looking out a decade ago, it's 30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| That's a 30 times increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| I mean, that's just astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| And that's why I said it's like having a car payment go from $300 to $9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| It's just a difficult way to plan and run a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| When we look at this hybrid plan, we're going to get projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| But we know for one thing, they'll be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| Hopefully, you know, the market will skyrocket and everything will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| But if not, we or some other council down the road is going to be cleaning up the mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| And I, for one, am tired of politicians, you know, putting these messes where they get benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| and someone else has to pay for them down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| So I'm just for a pay-as-you-go system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| See if I can follow that, you know, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| I think one of the things that I'm concerned about, and I agree with what my colleagues had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| is that, you know, five, ten, 15 years ago, we had a pension plan, and they started adding things to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3661)|
| 1:01:10| And so the hand that we've been dealt with is looking at what we have to do on down as far as the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| And the one thing that I don't want to do is I don't want to be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| for adding on to something that's already there, that we already have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| We know we've got to take care of a certain situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| And I think the other thing is, and it's, and again, I know all of us have said that we appreciate what the city does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| and all the employees, but we do have a serious obligation to the taxpayer, the person that's going to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| And if we're looking at, I know the mayor said, I think, that the $2 million that we need this year is going to be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| But then we have two more years, three more years, four more years in terms of where we're going to have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| And I know that just like some of my colleagues, a number of folks have contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| And we've been out in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| And some of us that have our own businesses know what we've had to do the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| My employees have taken pay cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| They've gone without pay for several weeks in order to, so that no one is laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| Now, sure, they've made choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| And we've all made choices if we're in the private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| But I think at the same time, you know, it's going to be pretty hard for me to look at some of the taxpayers out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| who are on fixed incomes, who are on fixed social security, whatever it is, and say, by the way, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| we have a program that we're going to have to continue to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| And so, you know, to me, it goes back to what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| I mean, let's keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Let's take care of the employees and take care of the promises that we've made to those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| And then let's start with a brand-new program and not have a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| Because this is going to end up costing us also in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| I mean, anything we do is going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| But I think that to go to the taxpayers with a simple request is a lot better than trying to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| and trying to explain hybrid plans and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| So I have a problem supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| I wanted to address something that Councilman Wallace brought up just a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| and that was separating the pension from the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| I spoke with not only Rob Frost but Charles Swanson about the suggestion that I made last week to basically use the item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3802)|
| 1:03:30| in the charter, Article II, Section 225, and close the existing plan and then work under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3810)|
| 1:03:37| I would like for Charles Swanson, wherever he is, and I know he was here because I told him I was going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| to come and explain to me once again publicly why, in your opinion, we shouldn't, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3824)|
| 1:03:57| should not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| And Rob, I think, gave me exactly the same explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| I am not advising you that it is not possible to take the pension program out of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| That can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| But I believe that in order to do that, you're going to have to give the voters an opportunity to make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| by referendum whether they're going to take the pension plan out of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| When you adopted the charter, you adopted a charter that had a comprehensive pension plan in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| You gave notice to the voters, and the voters voted on a charter that had all of your pension plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| within that particular charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| And so because it is so comprehensively done, it seems to almost assume the field with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| So if you're going to take that back away from the voters and do it by some other method, which you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| please understand what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| I'm not saying you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| You can do it, but you need to give the voters an opportunity to vote on the question of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| or not you're going to remove modifications to the pension plan from the charter as it currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| In my view, I believe that's what you would need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| Well, my suggestion, and this was what I had suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| was not really taking the existing plan out of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| I mean, just close it and leave it there, but then work under Article II, Section 225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| Well, apparently, you really have to close one completely, in your opinion, take it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| de-charter it, if you will, right, and then move on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| And I agree with the mayor on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| I think right now that I think there's going to be so much on the ballot this year between the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| and us and so forth that that would be exceptionally confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| I think the potential for confusion to the voters would be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| And the truth is, if you're going to adopt a new program, whatever that new program may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| whether it's the defined contribution, whether it's the hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| whether it's some third variety that you come up with between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| whichever plan you come up with, you will have developed that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| And so the likelihood that you're going to have significant modifications to that plan within the next two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| which is when you'll have an opportunity, without confusing to the voters, to present that very question to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| You'll have the opportunity to vet it to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| You can submit that to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| And it's really unlikely to me that you're going to have a real significant need to have modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| in whatever plan you come up with in that two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Well, that does bring up another question that Mr. Zevi brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| I think it was Mr. Zevi, maybe it was Mr. Williams tonight, that whatever you adopt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| if we can put language in the thing that would allow us to amend it, I don't know if we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| No, modifications to your pension plan right now have to be submitted to the voters by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| And I think if you're you can, in fact, change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| But if you change it, I think you've got to give the voters the same opportunity to address that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| because when they voted for it the first time, it was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Rob, do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| You have a question for Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| If not, I'll go to Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| But if you've got a question for him, we'll cover that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Go to me before you go to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| Well, if it's going to be direct, his light was on before yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| I don't know if this goes to you or if it goes to Rob, but would someone just clarify the process that we go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| In other words, the mayor has made a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Council was talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| The pension board has something to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Somehow it's going to end up on the ballot by a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| But what is the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| What is it that we are supposed to be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| Well, it would be presented to council as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| It would have two separate readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Well, the administration can submit one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| It's my understanding they have kind of started working a little on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| If it passes on two readings, then it has to be submitted pursuant to the charter to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| First it's got to go to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| The first thing, it's got to go to the pension board and pardon me for interrupting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| What goes to the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| What the mayor comes up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| What council comes up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| What council wants to go to the pension board is what goes to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Council will decide what goes to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| But before you vote on it, it's got to go to the pension board first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| And they have 60 days to review what it is that's being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| and to offer their thoughts and recommendations on it to you to the extent that they have any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| and to give you some kind of perhaps fiscal note on it to let you know what the expense will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4119)|
| 1:08:47| And then when that comes back from the pension board, which has to occur within 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| from the time that you send it to the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| it's at that point that you decide both on first and second reading whether you're going to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| So the mayor's suggestions come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| They don't send anything to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| What's going to happen is there's going to be an ordinance prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| There may be two ordinances prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| There may be the ordinance for the plan that the mayor proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| There may be some other ordinance that comes out of somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| There may be two ordinances prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| But you, as a councilor, are going to decide which of those ordinances goes to the pension board for its review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4164)|
| 1:09:32| and submission back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| And then they have the right to make changes, additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| They don't make changes or additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| They just tell you what they think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| You said to be the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| We're the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Then it comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| And whether you make any changes or anything relative to what their recommendation may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| you don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| You just have to receive their information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| and use it for to whatever extent you wish to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| But they have to have the opportunity to advise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| I was going to go back to Mr. Zevi's comment with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| Any plan you adopt, you should consider adding the right to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| And I ask that because the debate around this room has been whatever we adopt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| we ought to have some sense of what the risk is that we're taking on as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| and obviously a risk that we're passing on to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| And I wanted to ask Bud Gilbert, if he's still there, and I don't know whether he is or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| whether this idea of amending inside the plan, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4240)|
| 1:10:47| the plan has certain terms in it like the amount of employee contribution or whatever, the cutoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| or the pay that it applies to, whether you can draft that, not you personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| but whether it can be drafted in such a way that you're not bound forevermore once someone puts in their five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| or ten years to never change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| In other words, can you keep that somewhat fluid, or do you take whatever risk is inherent in the proposal once you adopt it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4267)|
| 1:11:15| and once they've served their time in service to become vested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| I'll try to answer that very simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| We don't design modern pension plans without a clause in the back of them that says the plan can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| The charter language today in Article 13 that contains the current plans for the city does not have that clause in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| I noticed it had it for KUB, but it didn't have it for the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Well, that KUB is now de-chartered in their plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| They have the authority to adopt, modify, change, whatever they needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| We would never advise city council to move forward with a modern pension plan that did not have that language in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4307)|
| 1:11:56| But that doesn't answer the question of whether that gives you an automatic right to change vested benefits under Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| That very issue is being litigated, and it's resulting in different opinions in different Supreme Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| But the idea is that if you would here's what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| If I join a plan with an expectation that I don't have it nailed down, that it can change to meet future contingencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4333)|
| 1:12:23| what is it I'm insisting on having other than that change, if it comes, be done in good faith to meet that obligation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| I mean, isn't the rules of the game somewhat different now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| You change the rules of the game by the way you write that amendment section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| So that you might mitigate future risks somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Yes, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Let me follow up on that, on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| So what you're saying is we could draft it and we could have it where we could amend it later on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4375)|
| 1:13:07| But if it's still inside the charter, then the charter would overrule that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| and you still wouldn't be able to change it unless it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Well, we're really getting into very detailed questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| but it would depend on what the language said because the amendment clause would need to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| how do you mean that you can amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Is it through a charter amendment or is it through some other action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| So the devil's in the details on that, so it's a little hard to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| But I just recommend when you get to that point, you know, listen to what your lawyers advise you on your options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| and counsel will ultimately make that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| And you can build it with a lot of flexibility or you can tighten it up because there may be political concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| Obviously, employees will be concerned about how much flexibility you build in it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| You know, they want to see their bargains represented in that contractual arrangement, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| So that's some heavy lifting that you'll have to do when you get around to the actual plan design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| I was going to ask my question, I think, of Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| I didn't have him come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| But I'm just curious about is Knoxville unique in terms of having these pension changes in forms of a referendum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4454)|
| 1:14:24| Are other cities doing the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Or is this something that's pretty unique with Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| I have not done a survey of all other municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| Certainly, I don't think that Knoxville is unique in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| I also don't think that they're in the majority in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| I think probably the majority do not require that the pensions be within the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4485)|
| 1:14:52| I think that's probably a minority position rather than a majority position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| And while I'm up here at the podium anyway, in order to avoid confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| and I agree with what Mr. Gilbert said, but I want to make sure you aren't confused by what he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| because what he said was you can't change Blackwell by putting a provision in there that says we can change this later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4508)|
| 1:15:16| That doesn't mean that when people have vested benefits, you can go back and diminish those benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| whether you've got that language in there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Blackwell is still Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| And until Blackwell gets changed by our Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| I think that the prudent person is going to be guided by Blackwell in terms of whether or not you can diminish for vested employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4529)|
| 1:15:38| benefits that are conferred in a pension plan, regardless of whether it's a charter plan or a non-charter plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4538)|
| 1:15:48| Before you leave, Mr. Johnson, since you jumped out on a limb, I was sitting there thinking maybe I could tip at it a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| Are you saying that assuming that the skill set is there to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| you couldn't say such COLA as annually awarded by, I don't know, the pension board, the council, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| which could be anything from zero to three based on the CPI, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| some standard in there that allowed the legislative body or the pension management body to say, look, this has been a miserable year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4572)|
| 1:16:22| We're going to have zero COLA this year because we're losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| I mean, is that as long as the plan says that's what I'm buying into, haven't you bought into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| Yeah, I think that's how you design your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| What I'm saying is if you design the plan in a specific way and you get down the road, for example, you say the COLA is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4595)|
| 1:16:44| just as an example, you say the COLA is going to be two percent per year regardless, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| You put that into your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| And then you go down the road, whether you're in the charter or whether you're not in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| you go down the road and you've got some people vested under that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| You want to go back and change that COLA to a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| You've potentially got a Blackwell problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| Now, Blackwell didn't deal specifically with the issue of COLA, so you have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| But you have a COLA problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| So what you have to be careful to do in that regard is design it in a way that you don't have that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| And this plan specifically tells the person who's in the plan that that may be a varying figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| The war is discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| And as I recall, and Dr. Lyons may correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| I think that the COLA that was being proposed in the hybrid plan is a COLA that would, in fact, be variable based on CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| As I understand it, with a max cap of three, but it wouldn't be an automatic three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| It would be a varying COLA based on what the CPI for inflation shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| As I understand it, Mike Cherry told me in the past we had a CPI COLA that could be negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| In other words, if there was actually a deflation factor, you might lower the benefit rather than raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| We had done that in this Knoxville plan, what, ten years ago, Mr. Cherry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Mike Cherry, are you gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| You're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| Why do you all sit over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| As far away as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| They're afraid of this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Hoping to stay over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| Again, Mike Cherry, executive director of the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Yes, in before what we refer to as the enhanced COLA came into existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| The previous COLA, which was in the charter for years, was tied to the CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| And that language indicated it did have a cap of three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| For those over 62 at the time could actually have a cap of four percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| So a little bit different cap based on the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| But it also had the language in there relative to the CPI that that would be increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| or decreased depending upon that CPI result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| And yes, in 2009, which is the first and hopefully the only time, that in fact, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| the inflation factor was a negative figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| At that time, the only ones in the plan who were affected by that happened to be a group of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| from the education decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Because they had the enhanced plan and then that the enhanced COLA, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| which was sunset at that time and went back off to the old provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| But it actually lowered their benefit for that period because the cost of living had decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| We did apply that decreased percentage to those individuals' benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I'll say just for general information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| had supplied us with some interesting information here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| And of the top ten cities in the state of Tennessee, there are three, Nashville, Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| and Chattanooga that do have the pension in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| The rest of them don't, if you'll fill in the handout that we were provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| I can count to five, and we've got some work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4797)|
| 1:20:04| I mean, if this, you know, we need to decide as a council if, you know, if we're going to modify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4804)|
| 1:20:12| if we're going to, I mean, I don't hear overwhelming support for what's been presented tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| So I need guidance from you all as to what the next meeting is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| So it's not anything that you have to tell me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| But I think there's more work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| So if we can think about it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| I was going to ask you, are we going to have our guesstimator here next time to tell us what he thinks it costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| Yeah, I mean, we'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Is there any way Alan could provide us the scenario since y'all changed the retirement ages on these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| and regraph that for us and also your D.C. only plan so that we just have those two plus our current line at the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4852)|
| 1:21:02| And that way we would have that for the workshop if he could provide us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| Yes, we can ask him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| Mr. Vice Mayor, I'd also like just to announce now that I will not be here at the next workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| I've had plans to be out of town for six months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| But my able staff will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| And that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| I mean, you know, this is, as we've said, we're not going to be in a hurry to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| We're going to hopefully do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| And the amount of time it takes is the amount of time that it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| I would ask and impose to see if Mr. Gilbert could perhaps be at the next meeting, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4893)|
| 1:21:41| We would certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| You've got a wealth of knowledge and appreciate your input tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| With that, I'll go to Councilman Wah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| We're going to let's say I know some other Councilmembers have got some engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| We've got some quite a few publics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Well, you asked what we wanted to talk about next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| And I think you I don't know who would be the right person to ask to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| and present on a defined contribution plan, the 457 plan that you have now or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| what it looks like and what the benefits are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| I think we all need to hear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| But, you know, we've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| That's what I was going to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| No, that's Jessica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Jessica is sitting here in the audience, and she's actually with Prudential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| and she's the plan administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| But this is the optional benefit plan that we participate in aside from the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4947)|
| 1:22:34| So that would not necessarily be the person that would do a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| It could be possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| I'm not sure through the process, through purchasing, if we'd have to go out for a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| and have another provider or if we could amend the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| and existing contract that we have to do a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| I think there's somebody, maybe it's her, I don't know, but to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| and present how it looks, how it works, the benefits of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| I mean, it's scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I mean, and that could be the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| It could be certainly a good portion of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| So I don't know who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| Well, I think we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Hey there, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| My name is Jessica Ehlers, and my address is 10124 Red Hillard Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| I would tell you probably the best person to come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| and actually give you a presentation on that type of information would most likely be Joe Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| from Morgan Keegan that is the city's financial advisor on the deferred comp program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| He's extremely familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| I've already talked to him today to see if that would be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| I figured I would probably be pulled into this at one point or another for him to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| and actually give you a decent presentation on how that works, costs associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| everything that you want to know about the current deferred comp program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| And I can speak to him about that tomorrow if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| Right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| Yes, Vice Mayor, I'd just like to get some clarification on our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| After we have the next workshop, May 3rd, at some point, would we then vote on some type of plan and then send it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5042)|
| 1:24:16| I know we don't want to be rushed, and you've stated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| But I'm asking if we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| And then would we then send that if we voted on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| we would then send that to the pension board for their not approval, but for their to look over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5066)|
| 1:24:34| Is that the process of where we are at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| That's the way I understood the process to work, and I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| And we, I mean, you know, there's no set number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| I mean, if we find something at the next meeting, then fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| And, you know, we may be five, ten meetings from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Well, Vice Mayor, we do have a deadline to get it to the pension board by June 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| But I think we've all discussed and have come to the conclusion that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| if it doesn't happen this cycle, then perhaps the next cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| But I understand people want to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| But we need to get it done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Well, Councilman Grieve's light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| I just want to reiterate what George was saying is that I'd like to hear that presentation also at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| See what alternatives there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| I mean, I would say that, you know, gosh, I'd certainly hope we'd find a solution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| But I think, you know, what I'd like to see is I think everybody knows at least where I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| but I don't know where everybody is on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| And I think the first step is it's basically a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| I mean, we don't need too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| I don't think we need another presentation or more nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| You know, you've got Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| I think it's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Do you want to stick with sort of a plan like we have now, go to a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| or go to a defined contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| And that's a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| So, I mean, I would just ask that everybody come ready to say, you know, what type of plan they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5171)|
| 1:26:18| Eventually, we're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| It's up to this board, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| No one's going to come in here and it's up to us to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| So I think we all just need to pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| And then, you know, if there's a lot of support for the hybrid, then that narrows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| Then we can start working on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| If there's support for the defined contribution, then we start working on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| But I think that first step is a policy step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| And I think, you know, I mean, obviously, I've made my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| If you all need more information to make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| I would encourage you to do that outside of the meeting because it just we're going to work this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| this issue to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Once we pick a plan, I mean, we've still got some work to do to tinker with that and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| to play with the numbers and send those to the actuaries if it's a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| I mean, there's a lot of numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| So that's what I would like to see on the next meeting or, you know, I thought it might happen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| And, Councilman Saunders, don't misunderstand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| I mean, I want to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| You know, I want to get it done, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| But this is the first meeting, really, that, I mean, after the process that we've gone under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| we've listened and I think it's been a healthy, transparent process, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| And I think we've got bookends now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| So, I mean, the administration has brought forth their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| And if this is not the proposal, then I guess it would be up to the individual council members to come forth with their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5262)|
| 1:27:51| That's the only other way that I know to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Councilman DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Yeah, I was trying to process what Marshall said, and there's a lot of wisdom in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| I think one of the policy issues that we're still struggling with is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| is the police and fire side of the ledger different than the general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| Or do they all stay together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Or can they be decoupled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| I don't know if there's a significant issue there that we need to wrestle with or whether, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| or whether we're going a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| But that's the remaining question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| It seems to me that those two plans, defined contribution and the hybrid plan, are what's really on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| and the rest is just background noise, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| But there's still that internal question, are those two joined at the hip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| or can they be treated differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| Let's make the first decision first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| What's the one that we'll --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| I'm just saying that I think that's still something at least I'm cogitating on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| but I'm trying to figure out, you know, how we make the leap he wants to make quickly, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Well, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| I mean, Councilman Frost, Rob, I mean, help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| I mean, we can separate the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| I mean, you can have a plan for the general and then one for the uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| I mean, if that's his question, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| Yeah, it's assumed in the plan you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| There's five options or six options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| I'm just trying to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| With Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| I was just going to say, are my colleagues ready to take a straw vote on this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| I think we should wait until next time and get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| Let's stretch that out, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| I think if we --I think there may be some proposals come and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| there can be a lot of work done in a week's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| I mean, that's just my feeling is to let it work one more meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| But, I mean, it's at the pleasure of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| I think there's a lot of information out there that can be gathered between now and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| and perhaps will be at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| That's just my two cents on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| My only point of asking for more information, it's not that I don't realize I can study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| I think it's as much for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| I think it's as much for the employees to hear that possibly the 457 type of plan is not as evil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5406)|
| 1:30:13| as it may be presented or what they may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| I don't want to present all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| I think once that information is out and you see the flexibility in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| and you see the benefits in it, then you kind of go, wow, it's not as evil as I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| That's really my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| I mean, I think I'm ready to vote if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| But I think we can wait until next week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| Is that an old line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| So, that being said, we'll go to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| And first up is Barbara Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| I think she left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| Oh, she left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| That concludes our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| Mr. Mayor, I have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| You've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| You're going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| I need a cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| I'm going to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5469)|
| 1:31:21| I'm coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Wait, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5482)|
| 1:31:31| Ms. Ma'am, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Y'all should have it recorded in memory, but it's Anita Cash, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| And before I start, I just want to make a few clarifications that's been said here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5500)|
| 1:31:49| One of your speakers that was here, and, by the way, both of your speakers were for private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| And I respect the mayor that she has continually tried to guide us that we are not a private company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| We are a municipal government, which we work under completely different parameters than private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| And trust me, I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Many moons ago, but I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| We did some research today, and the city of Nashville has a defined benefit plan for their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5534)|
| 1:32:23| And believe it or not, they don't pay one red cent into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| The city pays it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| And we're not asking you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| And I'm not real sure, but I'm almost positive that Mr. Pennington is not the actuary for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5552)|
| 1:32:42| And there was reference made that he was there and gave a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| and misled county commission as to the cost for that pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| And he is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| I'm almost positive he's not, because if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Bob Cross is their actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| And the only other thing I want to say is taxpayers do have access to our pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5578)|
| 1:33:06| That's why they're allowed to vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| And trust me, we don't want our pension taken out of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| nor do we want that right taken away from the citizens of this great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| I want to thank Vice Mayor Pavlis and all of you here on city council for your continued efforts to find a workable solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| for the employees and the taxpayers of this most volatile, important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| Trust me, none of us envy you your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| I want to also thank you for the straw polls you took tonight, the straw poll you took tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| If you'd only done that two times ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| we could have been a way on down the road from where we were when we started here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| So I do thank you for that, and I thank you for your commitment to current employees, whether they are vested or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| I want to thank Mayor O'Hara and her administration for her willingness to tackle this most controversial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5635)|
| 1:34:03| And I also want to thank her for her many meetings that she has had with the employee group representatives on a group effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5643)|
| 1:34:11| as well as individual meetings when each of us have called to meet with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| And trust me, there have been a number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| I also want to thank her for her willingness to listen to us and for her willingness to make adjustments where she thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| that it was in the best interest of the taxpayers and the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| None of us wants change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| However, it is inevitable, and we understand that it does have to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| While no employee is or ever will be 100 percent in favor of the hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| we are able to say that it is workable and it is doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| And I'd like for you to remember these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| And I know most of you, from what I've heard, are going for the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| And I really want to tell Mike Cherry, thank goodness for that straw poll where he had to hire extra people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| While this is not a plan we would have asked for, nor is it a plan we love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| as I said, it is a good plan and it is something that we can work with and live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| It will have no effect on current employees, whether we're vested or non-vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| And it is a great compromise for the administration, the employees, but most of all for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5721)|
| 1:35:29| This plan has a shared risk on behalf of all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| And if you already make more than $40,000, your greater risk is going to be on the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| And, Mr. Wallace, a lot of us do participate in that 457K, and we know what we lost in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| So we're well aware how defined contribution plans work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| This plan will offer competitive benefits to recruit, train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| and retain qualified employees at less expense to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| At less expense to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| Less expense even than what we currently have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| And I want to offer you just this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| If you're going to reduce the benefits and you're going to go to a completely defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| you need to talk to Vicki Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| She talked the other night and see just how many employees fall beyond the 50th percentile in their salary ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5781)|
| 1:36:32| In general government, and you also heard Vicki talk about the little guy that took home $293| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| and $25 of that he had to pay out in his pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| He is below the 20th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| And the next one is slightly above the 30th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| And it's the same for police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| So if you're going to take away our benefit that we work for in the shape of our hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| you're going to have to come up with some money to put in our paychecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5825)|
| 1:37:16| Is it Greenberg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| I can't really read it real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5839)|

| 1:37:23| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| My name is Michael Greenberg, 5305 Beverly Oaks Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| My speech got a lot shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| I just want to thank you for your commitment to as a non-vested employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| I just want to thank you for your commitment to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| We're going to continue to honor our commitment to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| So I just want to say thank you on behalf of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| Chas Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5871)|
| 1:38:02| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Good evening, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| While listening, I'll just a few points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| Chas Terry, 8523 Dresden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| A few points kind of stuck out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| No, as a police officer, I think every officer in here truly loves their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| and I just want to thank you all for allowing us to do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| We serve this city as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| A few things stuck out in my mind while listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| My job doesn't involve financial analysts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| I'm not at a desk 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| My job involves life, debt, protection, and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| Well, our lives are very often on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| And we do this for this city because this is what we've been called to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| This is what we enjoy doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| I heard a lot of people talk about things like risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| It's a risk for us every time we pull a car over on I-40 at 3.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| It's a risk for us every time we enter a building where we know the gunman still is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| We don't think about risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| I've never heard a citizen say anything about a pinch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| when we're in the middle of Kingston Pike performing CPR on a woman on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| I've never heard anybody, I never heard the lady talk anything about a pinch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| when she decided to hang herself from a swing, but we climbed up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| and took that chain from around her neck because she really didn't want to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| We appreciate what you all do for us, and we appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| But I'm standing here now for those officers that will come after me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| my 18-year-old son who wants to enter this line of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| I just want to make sure that he knows that very few of us who are officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| by the time we leave this tour of duty, be it natural causes or unnatural causes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| our bodies are a wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| We wear 30 pounds of gear every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| So I just want you to take these things into consideration when you make your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| Frederick Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6009)|
| 1:40:20| I live at 5904 Loyce Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| I want to thank the council for keeping the vested and non-vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6025)|
| 1:40:33| I do have a little bone to pick because we always seem to be overlooked as the public service workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| We're in danger, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| You tell that person that has to go out in the middle of Rutledge Pike and fix a pothole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| and that was my coworker, and he is now bound by a wheelchair because he got mowed over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| You take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| You take into consideration the person that has to work over during football season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| picking up litter, and being spit on by a drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| You take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| So don't forget about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| There's not many of us here, but we're important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| But I want to thank you for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| But don't forget about the public service workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| We do our job also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6078)|
| 1:41:29| Tony Willis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Tony Willis, 1073 Bartlett Drive, Jefferson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| Thank you for your indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| One of my coworkers so kindly said that I could serve as an example of what police work does to us physically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6103)|
| 1:41:53| because I'm actually only 21 years old, and this is what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| Funny individuals I work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| We all, I think you've heard enough examples of the risk that we have taken and that we do every day and night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| And I do appreciate the gentleman's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| From a general government perspective and the service department, what they do, we certainly appreciate what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| We reach out and coordinate their help with many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| Codes and all the things that supplement this city are quite important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| and we don't want to overlook that, and that point should not be overlooked by counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| But I've got to speak about what I know, and that is the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| I came here from Indiana, and I know you don't want to hear testimonials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| We are beyond that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| We are approaching the brass tacks time of deciding what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| The problem is well chronicled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| You've heard from many members who are more wise than myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| But I will tell you that I came here by choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| I was subsequently captured by a southern girl and not allowed to leave for the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| But initially I was here by choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| And the reason for that is because of the beauty of the city, the beauty of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| This municipality is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| I've had the privilege of living outside of Pittsburgh and then growing up in north central Indiana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6193)|
| 1:43:20| where I'm a lifelong Cubs fan, and I ask for your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| And it's not another 103 years for the World Series champs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| But I will tell you that this place is chosen because it is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| We understand the complexities of the problem that you face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| As has been spoken, no one envies the seats that you sit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| and the issues that you must struggle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| But we are partners in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| And I've heard many of you speak about doing right by the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| But it hasn't been defined yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Well, we know that taxpayers, as Mayor Rojero has said, they want great service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| And that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| At the police department, which is the segment of city government that I can speak about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| as many have said before me, excellence is what we deliver every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| It is the critique of our own performance that makes us unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| We also invite criticism from our constituents, which are the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| You cannot slide a piece of paper between this department and a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| So doing right by them is what we do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| And I would challenge you and say that to the tune of over 300,000 times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| we have individual meetings with them in the form of calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| I will not go into the risk that we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| That's understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| And I genuinely believe that this council appreciates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| That doesn't need to be belabored, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| But I do think that the direction we go and for this council, it will certainly define you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6299)|
| 1:45:07| To this point, it's certainly the biggest issue, it appears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| that this council has dealt with and how you go forward will be your signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| And I ask that even those who I respectfully submit that I appreciate the commitment by members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6316)|
| 1:45:25| who have chosen a position and said that they want to be the fiscal conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| We do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| We are on a finite budget as a police department, certainly changes from year to year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| but we deal within a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| We understand those principles and we are partners with you in trying to stay within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| But I would suggest to you that we don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| There are some other avenues that may be explored that may yet keep some form of what we have for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6349)|
| 1:45:57| And, again, this is going to be possibly your legacy, possibly current employees' legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| what we leave for those in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| And that is a heavy burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| I don't think, in my opinion, that being fiscally conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| and taking care of employees in the form of a defined benefit plan are necessarily at odds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| I think you can be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| I say that because of the difference between a government employee and private industry, the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6382)|
| 1:46:31| Both representatives from the private sector tonight, although I know little about them, have departed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6391)|
| 1:46:38| And one thing that they did not elaborate on is opening their books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| or giving us a salary range of their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| I would suggest that no matter what the hit the salaries have taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| that they have an earning capability in the form of commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| or arbitrating for a higher salary in a given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| But it may be performance-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| No matter what we do as individuals for this city, insignificant or large, noticed or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| great and small contributions, it will not change the salary range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| There is no ability to compete for an individual higher salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| no matter how deserving an individual may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| And we have many that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| That is the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| We are asking for the security of a deferred compensation, not in the form of a 457B, but philosophically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6451)|
| 1:47:38| And that is in exchange for earning potential now, we are hoping for the security of what a pension provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6458)|
| 1:47:47| That is what we are asking for is at the end of this journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| And it is arduous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| And I would invite you all to ride along with us and see that firsthand that we have the security of a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6472)|
| 1:47:59| We will sacrifice for now for that deferred, philosophical deferred compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6484)|
| 1:48:13| Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| Mark Taylor, 724 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| I'd like to, first off, I'd like to thank counsel for their commitment to current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| And I know that with your strong poll tonight, you relieved a lot of concern and worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6508)|
| 1:48:36| And I think that was very necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| And I appreciate you showing the leadership to do that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| So, first, I'd like to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| I won't go over all the points I've made in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| You kind of know my positions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| I sent out a little literature to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| Hopefully, you'll read some of that because I think there's some important, at least historical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6532)|
| 1:48:59| stuff in there from some very credible sources about the very questions you're going to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| Some of it directly from the government accounting office, from GASB, from very not hypothetical places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6543)|
| 1:49:11| places we all abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| And then I'd like to thank all of you for your consideration of this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| It's a tough subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| I don't agree with probably some of the ideas, you know, and I agree with some more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6559)|
| 1:49:29| But I would say that most of all, I appreciate Mayor Rojero for coming out in front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6569)|
| 1:49:37| taking the lead, and taking a stand, actually committing to details of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| If you pass her plan as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| you will pass the most fiscally conservative retirement benefit that this city has probably ever engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6589)|
| 1:50:02| The scope of this is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| I mean, even when you look at our contemporaries around it, it's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| I'd like for you to hopefully give it consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| Like she said, it probably doesn't make me happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| I mean, I was probably going to kick and scream in her office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| But, you know, it's realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| The taxpayer, we appreciate the taxpayer very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| We realize that there's a big burden out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| I think that that is a very responsible way to relieve that burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| And it's a lot of give on the employees, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| It's a lot of give on that traditional contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| So hopefully we can meet in the middle on that and you'll give that good consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| I appreciate your time and attention to the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| Brian Moran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| Brian Moran, 4445 Broad Middle Way in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| I just want to address a couple of things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| I do want to echo somewhat of what Anita said regarding the risk of the 457.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6664)|
| 1:51:13| I don't see a safety net there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| And here's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| I hear all this talk about risk, risk to the taxpayer, by which all of us are, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| And then risk to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| So let's just throw the city employees in a 457.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| And let's say I'm 52 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| And let's say I'm planning on retiring in three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| I lose 50 percent like in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| Does that mean the city employee has no safety net and has to work another 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| Do you want a police department of 65-year-old men out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| That's what we're talking about when we're talking about deferred compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| The mayor's put forward a plan that splits the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| It's not a golden parachute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| But it doesn't shift the entire risk to the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| Think about what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| Are you talking about making an employee work until they die behind a desk if the stock market crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| because there's no safety net?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Granted, you don't want to up the taxes, you know, on the taxpayer by 30 cents or 50 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6725)|
| 1:52:11| But the reality of it is you don't want to shift the entire risk to the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| That's not being a responsible employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| I lost half of what was in my 457 in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| God forbid that was my only retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| God forbid it happens to me when I'm 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| I just ask you to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| I'd also like to address the point about the county pensions and some of the misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| We're comparing apples and oranges here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| I was one of the leads in getting that county pension plan passed, and it isn't because of the return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| Just like this pension plan is not in such bad shape as much as the return as mismanagement in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| and we all discussed what happened with Pension Plan F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| The county funded that plan against all the recommendations of all the experts, including GASB by doing it with bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6769)|
| 1:52:56| There's not a plan in this country that's been funded with bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| That's the reason they're going to be in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| If they were to listen to the experts, did what the ballot said, that plan wouldn't be nearly as in bad shape as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| So if we're going to put out information, let's make sure it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| The mayor has put forward a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| It's not a perfect plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| It splits the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| The defined contribution does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| You're talking about no safety net whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| You're talking about employees who could run the risk of losing everything, as most of our parents have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| And I don't think you want that for public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| It's just my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6812)|

| 1:53:52| Heather Dodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| This is the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| How many more you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| My name is Heather Dodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6840)|

| 1:54:05| You might want to pull the mic down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| I'm a little short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| I feel your pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| I'd like to thank council and Mayor O'Hara for all the hard work you've all had to do on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| It isn't going to be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| It's going to have a lot of consequences either way, regardless of what your decision is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6860)|
| 1:54:29| I'm a person who chose to move here from the Midwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| I took a 15 percent, almost 20 percent pay cut in moving here, and it was strictly because I admired the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6873)|
| 1:54:44| I liked what the city had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| I liked the growth that I saw in this city, and I liked the things that drew me to this area as far as the hiking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6886)|
| 1:54:53| backpacking, your outdoor elements, the history, all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| I didn't know a soul when I arrived in Knoxville, except for, you know, three people that I'd passed in interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6898)|
| 1:55:06| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| And I work as a building inspector in the Plans Review and Inspections Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| We do some code enforcement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| It's our job to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens as well as their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6920)|
| 1:55:28| We try to ensure that the firemen can get in and out of a building by protecting those building elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6928)|
| 1:55:37| That means we're trying to protect your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| We're trying to protect businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| We're trying to protect the history of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| And it's not an easy thing, especially when we're understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| Some of us have taken quite a considerable risk by taking that pay cut to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6952)|
| 1:56:00| I'm a taxpayer as well, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| I have an investment in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| And it's important to me because I'm just inside that curve as far as being vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6967)|
| 1:56:15| I've just made that mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| If this had come up two, three years ago, I would have to look somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| I'm a good employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| I work hard for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| I'd hate to see you not take into account what you will attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| or whom you will attract if you start cutting benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| And it's going to be real important that you think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| You're going to get people who may not have that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| I'm not saying that, you know, I'm unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| There's other people out here that have that same sort of commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| And they've grown up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| So I'd like you to take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| And I'm glad that you obviously haven't tried to take my benefits because I have hit that mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7017)|
| 1:57:06| But I would wish you to consider that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7032)|
| 1:57:19| What's the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| Kevin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street, Knoxville Firefighters Association President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7056)|
| 1:57:43| I want to thank Mayor O'Hara and her staff, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| She's asked us to work with her and work with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| Things aren't always as great as they seem to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| And we realize that as workers, employees, as citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| So I feel like, just right off the bat, we have made concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| That's what she has presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| Many, many meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| And we have given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| Like I said, I can't say enough about her for helping us, for working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| Councilman Campin, you said in your prayer, which was very good, you know, we're a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7097)|
| 1:58:26| I like to think of us as a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| Past administrations didn't seem so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| You know, they want to split you down the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Here we are trying to get with you to come to a common goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| Not just you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| I'm looking at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| But everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| You know, we're trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| And I know you guys are in a tough spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| You know, a gentleman earlier was talking about pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| Out of all the respondents for this Mercer study, which we're supposed to be up to about the 50th percentile by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7137)|
| 1:59:09| Sorry, I thought I seen somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| But we're at 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| These are 75 percent in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| You know, the pension, safety net, you know, that's what we look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7160)|
| 1:59:27| What Mayor O'Hara has put out there to you all, I think, is a fine compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7167)|
| 1:59:35| I was looking at this graph earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| Is this what you guys were looking at by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| The Knoxville pension system, 6.5 percent, page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| Because if it is, the defined contribution is going to cost more to the taxpayers from what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7187)|
| 1:59:56| So what Mayor O'Hara was offered up saves the taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7196)|
| 2:00:03| And you guys feel free to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| If I'm wrong, call me out on it as far as the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7205)|
| 2:00:12| So, in closing, which I've always wanted to say that, I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7212)|
| 2:00:18| I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| There is one more point I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| I got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| I do want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| He's probably costing the city a ton just in electricity with that light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| We had Amoresco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| Amoresco helped cut the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| No, seriously, on a serious note, the guy from general service, we all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7239)|
| 2:00:48| We all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| You remember the storms back in April, us, the police department, and the general service workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| You're not forgotten, I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| So thank you all, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7260)|

| 2:01:03| And this time I am quitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| See you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120426?start=7270)|
