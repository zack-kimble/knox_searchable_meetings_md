| 0:01:37| Tom Spangler, Noss County Sheriff, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Thank you, Madam Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| First of all, let me say to you all, thank you for your prayers, your thoughts, your cards, your calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=105)|
| 0:01:55| You don't know how much it means to me of what this commission reaching out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| And I'm a proud man and it's hard for me to accept those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| And but I want to say thank you to you personally, because I know each and every one of you reached out in some way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| And I'm grateful for that. And I'm blessed by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| I just want to say thank you. Also, I want to say thank you to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| I know he's not here today, but again, being a proud person that I am, it is very hard for for me to take the acknowledgement that he made during his budget announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=143)|
| 0:02:38| And I'm very thankful. He's a good friend and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| I know sometimes we have our disagreements and that's what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| But a good friend. And I want to say thank you, Mayor Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| So with that being said, I think everybody may know or have some idea of why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| We all have seen where KPD now has raised their their starting salaries of fifty six thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=177)|
| 0:03:06| What we did last year was was huge, as the mayor said in his in his budget proposal and announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=186)|
| 0:03:15| And I'm grateful. I'm grateful to him. I'm grateful to you all for what you're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Yes, it was the largest pay raise that we have that we have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| But what we did was just catch up. And we can't continue just to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| Part of that big raise came from some of the sacrifice that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| And that was giving up twenty nine positions, which equates to one point one four million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| It wasn't just that I come to this commission or come to the mayor and said, I need this kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| I made an effort on our part to make sure that we try to find some money as well to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| And that's what I want to try to do today as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| So it's it's very hard to be able to go back with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| You all have invested in this agency. You invested in these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| I had a very smart individual tell me. And you need to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| And I'm asking you to continue to investing in these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| What I'm here for today is those post certified officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| And I know this will probably upset some of the employees within the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| but it's the post certified officers that we're concerned about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| So you're talking roughly 400 individuals, 400 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| And we'll give you the numbers here just in a few. But I want to go over a few things that just to let you know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| Again, I talk about just catching up, but we have to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| I understand we're not going to be competitive with over an Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| We're not going to be able to compete against the highway patrol starting out at sixty five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| But we have to be competitive with our sister agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| It's just that simple, because we're going to if we keep going back and forth with KPD, they're going to come after our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| We're going to go after theirs. And they're going to look they're going to look at the salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| And it's just it's just that simple. It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| And you heard from the city mayor can cannon whenever she spoke about, you know, they deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| Yeah, they do. They absolutely do. We know what the job consists of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| So do the men and women, the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| I feel like I feel like whenever we got that big raise, we took two giant steps forward by getting us caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=334)|
| 0:05:43| And now here we are. Now we're taking five steps back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| And I don't want to have to come to the commission every year asking for this and asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| I want to be able to say we're good with it. We're happy with what the mayor has proposed for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| We're happy with what the commission is about to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| It'd be nice if for the next two years, I don't have to come to you and asking you for for a raise outside of what the mayor proposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| for all of Knox County employees. And if that happens, I'd be more than glad to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=371)|
| 0:06:21| For us to get up to fifty six thousand now, we're looking at four thousand dollars to move that up from fifty one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| Some odd change. And I'll have Allison up here if I need to, to give the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| But four thousand dollar difference now, four thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| A starting salary from our fifty fifty one, almost fifty two to fifty fifty six thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=400)|
| 0:06:50| Part of that is obviously we have this when we have recruits come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| It's a it's a housing issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| They're having problems finding finding a house that they can afford with that salary as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| And I think that's the same thing is what the city mayor made that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| Same thing with their guys and gals that are coming in. They have the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| And that's that's tough to be able to tell somebody or at least when they come into our county and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| I can't find anything affordable within that salary that I'm making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| So they go somewhere else. We can't continue to have that kind of give you an idea of where we were last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| We had one hundred ninety one. I come to this commission. We had one hundred ninety four vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| One hundred ninety four vacancies. That was up until June of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| From July one until today, we have thirty four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| That's law enforcement and corrections. That's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| What you all did, what this commission did helped this agency by bringing people in because of the salary we were able to raise it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:07| But then we have our city sister agency come in and step up and say, oh, we're going to we're going to we're going to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| And that's what I'm talking about, that two steps forward and that five steps backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| We can't continue to do that. I'm hoping that sometime I hear the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| They evidently meet the two mayors meet every every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| I'm hoping that maybe the two mayors and the two top law enforcement officers in in the county and the city can get together and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| what can we do to make this from being competitive against each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| Let's talk about that. Let's that may be something that that I'm dreaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| I don't know. Maybe it's something that can happen, but I think it's something worth looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| Those vacancies were huge. And I'm grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| I'm grateful for the staff that has worked their their backsides off to make sure that we get people in here and we get them interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=537)|
| 0:09:07| And that's the downside. I think it has helped us tremendously with the mayor council getting people hired quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| They have stepped up and really made it a lot easier on us as far as getting people interviews and get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| getting them through the process, which has made a big difference with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| And I'm grateful for that. And we continue. We still have people in the hopper, so to speak, right now that are being interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| We've made the conditional offers office to people. And so I want to continue making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| And again, kudos to you all for making that happen as well, because that's where it comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| Kind of give you another idea, too. I mentioned to you all last year that we had somewhere around 80 or so people ready to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=586)|
| 0:09:57| Last year, we had 26 people retire. Right now, currently and to the end of this year, we have 12 more that are retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=597)|
| 0:10:08| We can't replace experience. We can't do it. If I can't get people in here now, we struggle to be able to get people trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=608)|
| 0:10:17| and then get them out on the street, because as they go through the academy and they go through the 14-week FTO program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| you're talking almost four or five months before we ever put that person out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| And it makes it tough. I just lost a patrol captain who just retired this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| I lost another captain that retired last week as well. Supervision, retiring. It's hard to replace that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:52| I mentioned that we have 400 post-certified officers. Those are the ones that I'm talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| getting them that starting salary for law enforcement positions and then getting those caught up as well to make those differences in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=657)|
| 0:11:11| We all know the dangers of this job. It's every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| I don't know of anybody else that has to wear a vest or put a vest on to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| I know I'm being redundant about this, but it's from the heart to be able to tell you that we are a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=683)|
| 0:11:32| We are different from everybody else just because of, or at least the men and women are. Maybe I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| But the men and women that put that uniform on every day, that wear that shield, that put that sidearm on their side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| we're expecting them at any point in time to make a split-second decision on whether to save their own life or save somebody else's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=705)|
| 0:11:56| To be in a gunfight, we have had more officer-involved shootings in the past year than I can ever imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=716)|
| 0:12:08| Society has made this job even tougher, even more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| I started in this profession back in 1980. Never saw anything like it, what we're seeing today. Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| I knew it was dangerous then. Heck yeah, if you're having to carry a gun to protect yourself and or others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| they don't come after you as an individual. They come after you because of what's on your sleeve and what's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=748)|
| 0:12:36| But they're coming after us on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| These men and women are answering domestic calls on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| I've mentioned to you all that they go out here and have to answer a call that involves a crash, that maybe a child was killed in that crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| And then they get another, the next call they get is a minor fender bender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| They have to be able to flip a switch. They're almost like a robot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| And we're asking them to take a bullet, to be spit upon, to be assaulted for the salaries that we pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=785)|
| 0:13:16| I've always advocated we pay those more that entertain us than those who protect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| The job is very dangerous. It's different from any other job. I'm not taking it away from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=801)|
| 0:13:40| There's two positions, there are two professions right now that I deem that should be paid so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| And that's law enforcement and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| But I'm up here, I'm up here asking, I'm up here begging, I'm up here to say that this job to you all is more dangerous than it has ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=832)|
| 0:14:03| And I apologize, my mouth is dry because of you know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=843)|
| 0:14:11| Sheriff, if you could wrap this up in the next few minutes please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| With that being said, Commissioner, I spent last week in D.C. with the Officer Memorial Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| And to see the 200 and some odd officers' names being read was kind of tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| But I want to introduce somebody to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| I want to introduce Katerina Blakely, Officer Blakely's wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=877)|
| 0:14:47| It's not here to intimidate you, that's not the purpose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| I want you to see the reality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| This is somebody who's lost their husband because he was brutally murdered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| We can't have that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| I failed him because it happened on my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| I can't have that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| I won't have it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| But I want Katerina and I want Henny, their five-year-old son, to know that we still care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=914)|
| 0:15:24| We will, we will always care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| And I'm asking you all to at least maybe consider holding off on passing the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| until maybe that Allison and Chris can get together and see if we can't find some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| We were willing to look at some other things, and if you have any questions, I'll be more than glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| But I want to thank you for your time, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:59| We have one other public speaker that has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Is Hayden Bradfield here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=962)|
| 0:16:12| Is Mr. Bradfield here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| All right, I don't believe he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Well, that will conclude our public forum then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| We'll move on to any discussion that any commission members might have of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Allison, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| Sorry to catch you before you left, but if you could identify yourself before I ask your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=996)|
| 0:16:51| Allison Rogers, Finance Director for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| Sheriff Spangler, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| has asked for the 400 officers that are post-certified to move the starting salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:13| or the equivalent step thereof from $51,000 to $56,000 to match the sister agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1033)|
| 0:17:22| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| No, the entry-level salary for patrols is right at $52,000 for the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| and KPD has proposed a $56,000 entry-level salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Okay, so about $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| What does that translate to in dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| Salary dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Salary dollars plus carrying costs plus everything else that goes into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Well, the salary cost will be right at $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| That is after you do the 400 certified officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| This does not include civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| It does not include corrections officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| It is post-certified officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| That's 400 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| It's $4,000, so it's right at $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| I took off what Chris had already budgeted for a 2% two-step raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| so that gets it down to $1.2 salary only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| Then we would need to discuss benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| You don't have the numbers on those yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| For benefits, it's going to be $200,000 in addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| plus we would have to look at the UOP numbers separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1102)|
| 0:18:32| Okay, but you don't have that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| I don't have it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| but you can add at least another $200,000 on to that for Social Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| and then retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Okay, so you're essentially asking for almost $1.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| Right, probably closer to $1.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| $1.4, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Oh, that's right, because you took out the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| The two steps that have already been budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Any other relative dollars that need to be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| No, Chris and I have discussed a few things on revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| We're going to redo our marshal's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Blount County is charging $100 for their marshal's inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| We're charging $83 right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| so we're getting ready to try to up the cost to $100 a day for marshals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| and ICE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| which would hopefully possibly bring in anywhere from a quarter to a half a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| million more in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| That would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| And are there any other either revenue sources or cuts or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| I mean, is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| You're essentially asking for a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Is there anything else to consider in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| As far as our operations, there's no cuts that we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| I mean, we actually need more money than what's budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| We try to make that up by possibly some designations from this year to next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| year for those operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| I've mentioned a couple of things with Chris as far as capital goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| but of course those dollars are in a different account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| So we're trying to come up with every possible solution there could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| Is there still the discussion on the table about booking fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| We're open to look at any other revenue sources that we can, yes, get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| So, yes, anything would be open, including pretrial fees also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Mr. Caldwell, what page in our budget would I find?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| I'm just sort of picking through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| where our undesignated fund balance levels are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1258)|
| 0:21:09| That's on page 33 is the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| It shows you what we have proposed to use this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| So I believe our designated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| I think our fund balance in the general fund is about 81.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| But I would let you know that this is a recurring expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| and the fund balance policy does not allow a recurring expense to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| for fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| It's 84.9 to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1310)|
| 0:22:08| Finished? Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Commissioners, are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Mr. Caldwell, what did we have to contribute this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1340)|
| 0:22:33| or excuse me, for this next budget year for the Sheriff's retirement plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| The contribution to UOP from 24 to 25 went from about 10.5 million to 11.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1359)|
| 0:22:53| so about a $1.4 million increase, and is slated to go to about 13.4 and 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1373)|
| 0:23:02| From 11, from 10, what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| From 10.4 in current year to 11.9 in FY25, so the budget you all are voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| there's an appropriation there for 11.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| And then the preliminary number in 26 is 13.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1397)|
| 0:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| And the other thing that's totally, well, a first-time expense in the budget this year was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1410)|
| 0:23:40| was it $2.3 million for our ambulance provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Yeah, approximately 2.3 was what we budgeted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Okay. Does that increase every year going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| There is a small increase every year for dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| We're phasing that into 9-1-1, but it'll go up like, I think, $300,000 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| I've got three months left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| The nice thing about having three months left, you can kind of say what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| and you don't have to worry about getting reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| So I'm going to say what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| This isn't directed or a political statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| This is just, I think, the reality that we're going to be facing going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| We spent the last week talking about some of the budget challenges that we're going to be facing going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| when it comes to debt services, which is going to be a real challenge in the next three years upcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| Inflation this year is going to be around 3%, 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| Inflation in the last couple of years was 7%, 8%, 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| The economist in me, the simple fact is 2% is actually a decrease in pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1501)|
| 0:25:10| because it doesn't keep up with the inflationary rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| And these are the kind of things that the commission after me is going to have to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| how we're going to face these challenges over the next three years, basically, because that's our timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| We've got three years to make a decision on how we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Already this year, the budget is tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| I only project the budget being tighter as things go forward and inflation stays up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| There's no expert out there that's going to say that it's going to come down anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| So there's going to be some challenging roads ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| The sheriff knows I love him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I don't think this is good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| I think we should do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Unfortunately, I don't know where the money is to do better at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| We haven't put a revenue system in place where we can sustain the infrastructure that we want to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| I was breaking Jim Snowden's chops today asking him why can't we get five lanes all the way to the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| There's just not enough money to get five lanes to the high school in Hardin Valley to Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| We just don't have the money yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| We can get to Chick-fil-A, which is a start, but not to high school yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| So these are a lot of challenges we're going to face coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| and to make sure we're not trying to hide those facts from the public that I think all the commissioners up here are very much aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1586)|
| 0:26:36| I think the staff is very much aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I think everybody is trying to do the best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| I personally don't think it's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| I don't think it's ever going to be enough, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| There's always going to be more needs and more wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| But I do think there's a lot of tough decisions coming down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| and a lot of hard conversations we're going to really have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| and we're going to really need to have to decide what's important to us as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| and what's important to us as a county and what sacrifices we're going to have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| and what changes we're going to have to make to get us to where we want to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| These aren't going to be easy for anybody involved, for any department, for any elected official, for any citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| There's going to be some tough times where we have to figure this stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| So since I can speak freely, I just want to put that on the record that we have to have a really honest conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1641)|
| 0:27:31| the next three years about how we want to handle things going forward in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1651)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| Director Caldwell, I know in the past that we've looked at some potential options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:59| like a periodic bonus or percentage of pay or something like that to come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1679)|
| 0:28:09| and I know, at least my understanding is, that with many of our uniformed officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| that the reluctance and all that has been bypassing the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1697)|
| 0:28:26| I know, sitting on retirement with several of us, that quite honestly it's a backbreaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1706)|
| 0:28:39| I don't in any way imply that it isn't something that we need to do and we want to do and will continue to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1719)|
| 0:28:47| but it is a huge expense that continues to balloon and it's going to for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1727)|
| 0:28:58| Is there a dime? Is there a penny anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Even if we handle it more as a one-time payment instead of including it in benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1742)|
| 0:29:13| so that we could continue to maintain some control over the retirement fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1753)|
| 0:29:21| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| Ultimately, always better for us are bonuses versus a reoccurring expense increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1768)|
| 0:29:44| As we prepared this budget, one thing that we've been very consistently saying is there's not a lot of revenue growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1784)|
| 0:29:57| I sent you all an email this morning about sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| and sales tax for what we call March collections was relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| I think in the proposed budget for 2025, from a revenue standpoint, it's pretty stretched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1808)|
| 0:30:25| I'm not saying that once we get there that there's not going to be some revenues that come in more than we budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1825)|
| 0:30:41| I think it's going to be fairly close, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Then you look and you see that in our budget for the general fund, which is where these salaries would come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1843)|
| 0:30:52| we already have an appropriation from fund balance of $3.5 million and use of designations of $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| but before we even get started, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| I guess those are kind of the pain points, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| Revenue budget is fairly tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Expenses, as Commissioner Ward said, with inflation, can just continue to grow, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| We have contractual increases and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| With that being said, there is growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| I think it's natural growth, and it's not the level of growth that we have saw the last two or three years to where it was just more than expected, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1898)|
| 0:31:55| I think we went over Monday at finance committee about how we were doing year to year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1915)|
| 0:32:05| If you look at revenues over expenses in 24 compared to 23, that's right, have been cut in half, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:15| Meaning less money to end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| I keep on saying how that's going to continue to shrink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| That's just the first step of that shrinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| Alice, I think if you ask the mayor, if you ask you all, if you ask me, of course we would love to give raises to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1945)|
| 0:32:35| It's not our goal to say no raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| We prefer to do that and try to do what we can, but our charge is to bring a budget that is balanced and living within our means in this current environment, and that's what is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1960)|
| 0:32:59| Is there a chance as we end this fiscal year that there could be some monies for some adjustments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1979)|
| 0:33:08| Yeah, it's possible. We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| One thing that is coming about, too, is we've done really well in relationship to our self-insured health insurance fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=1992)|
| 0:33:26| Senior Director Candler brought to the mayor an opportunity to maybe do a rebate to employees as well as some premium holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2006)|
| 0:33:39| I think we're going to be able to do that, and that is something that isn't in here that wasn't anticipated but can be done to help and to alleviate some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2019)|
| 0:33:52| But as a whole, if you said to me, Chris, can you look in the general fund and find $1.5 million to add to revenues to make this happen, I would say unfortunately no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2032)|
| 0:34:07| Okay. Can you give a little more detail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| Because I believe what you had shared about the health care, that includes also any officers that are also…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2050)|
| 0:34:22| That would be true, and so anyone who is eligible for health insurance, which basically means you work 30 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2062)|
| 0:34:35| And so even if you don't take it, you would be eligible for the health insurance rebate, which we think we will pay out towards the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:45| It would probably be like $500 per plan member or potential plan member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| And then we are exploring the idea of some premium holidays towards the end of the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2091)|
| 0:35:02| And all that, just so you know, all that comes out of the health insurance fund, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| So I know it's accounting lingo, but all monies related to health insurance goes into a separate fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2106)|
| 0:35:15| and because of our employees and because of the work of our benefits team, we have been able to generate some reserves there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2115)|
| 0:35:28| and we wanted to be able to give those back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| So to be clear, I hear you saying that anyone that would qualify for the insurance, whether they're taking it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| at this point in time can look forward to a $500 bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Correct, if you're eligible, which is basically you work 30 hours a week or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2144)|
| 0:35:52| Correct, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| And then the health premium holiday, so to speak, what is the average amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2153)|
| 0:36:04| And I know this is very, but say a family plan that all of our employees pay for a month of health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2164)|
| 0:36:17| You know, Stephanie, you've got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| She can give you the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| I know most employees are on option two, and that will range from single to family, so it can vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2182)|
| 0:36:30| And I do understand there's a top and a bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| but I'm trying to get an idea of anywhere that we're trying to give back to our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| Hi, Stephanie Candler, Senior Director of HR and Benefits, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| I'm sorry, I was in discussion with my colleague and missed the actual question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| I was asking, Chris, because you all had shared with me the excitement of potentially a premium holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2212)|
| 0:37:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| What is the overall average that an employee pays per month for their health insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2221)|
| 0:37:10| I know whether it's single, family, but is there a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| So we directly know the cost to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| It depends on what option they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| On option one, it's only about $300-something per employee per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| And then if they're option two or option P, it's around $1,000, a little over $1,000 per employee per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| And the employee cost of all of their medical and all of their insurance on the health plan side is about 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| So the county pays 80, they pay 20, and that's even in the cost sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| Right now, we're actually paying about 93 percent of pharmacy just because the cost went up, but we haven't increased premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| So their out-of-pocket cost is just that whatever premium they pay and then 20 percent of their cost sharing for the claims otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2274)|
| 0:38:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| So is it fair to say that if they're taking advantage of the health insurance premiums that are offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| that there is the potential of several hundreds of dollars that they will not have to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Toward the end of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Yeah, especially if you're on a family plan like on option P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| I think their cost, I'd have to get it in front of me, but it's around $300 per pay period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| So $600 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Any little bit of good that might, you know, might be out there that we're giving back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| This question is for the co-chiefs of staffs on behalf of the mayor and his absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| Is the mayor aware of this ask, and if so, what was the time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| Has there been a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Yeah, I know that the sheriff spoke to the mayor today, and so they spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| And I think, you know, what the mayor would say is he respects what the sheriff is asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2346)|
| 0:39:15| and why he would love to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| The proposed budget that's before you is fiscally responsible and is the right approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2357)|
| 0:39:30| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Ms. Rogers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| Sorry, make you do the jog back and forth, but some more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2379)|
| 0:39:52| Is it still, last time, several years ago, we talked about the cost, the average cost to recruit, retain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2392)|
| 0:40:02| or recruit, onboard, train, and get an officer sort of in the pipeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| And I think it was about $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| Is that still kind of holding true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| I know it's a little more, a little less, depending on position, but is that pretty accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| That is the last figure that I've heard, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| So, I mean, we're essentially talking about, I mean, I know we're moving everybody that's up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| but the sheriff talked about the vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| In one year, when this commission approved the increase, we reduced our vacancies by 82%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2438)|
| 0:40:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| In just under a year, pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| It's just not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| I know it's a lot of money, but it's just not a lot of money when you think about the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| and I don't think it's an unreasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| We're talking about $1.6 million on a million .082 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| It's like .15% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| And the value of that in the retention and recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| and the ability to bring on more officers is, I mean, that's 16 people in a swing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| either to retain them or recruit them, and we know the needs are right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| My question, okay, that's my question for you, Miss Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Mr. Caldwell, what happens that independently elected officials have an opportunity to use a legal tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2503)|
| 0:41:55| which is a salary suit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| If we pass X and they feel like in order to do their mission or to do their job they need Y| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| and that's not awarded, they have the ability to go to court and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| I need this to be able to do my job as a constitutional officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| What happens if a judge says, yeah, this doesn't seem unreasonable and awards it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| Where would we get that from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| If a judge said we're going to add $1.6 million, I'm going to award you $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| Or I don't know exactly the mechanism in which it would come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| but let's say that the sheriff was successful in saying I need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Where would we get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| What would we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| You know, what you're thinking about is you're dealing with recurring expenses here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2564)|
| 0:42:53| And so while easily we can sit and say, listen, we've got $85 million in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2573)|
| 0:43:02| Why wouldn't we use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| We also have to understand from our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| and best practice that you should never use one-time dollars for recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| It can help you for a period of time, but it just doesn't get you there all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2593)|
| 0:43:21| And so I think we would look for any type of revenue source that would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2601)|
| 0:43:31| You know, Allison had mentioned that if we get the federal marshal amount increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| then that can account for some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| I mean, there are some things like that that can offset some of those expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| but until they're there, they're not a recurring revenue source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2628)|
| 0:43:57| The judge is never going to dictate where you pay this from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| So they're just going to say, hey, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| They're just going to say pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| I know, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| That's what they're going to say, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| They're not going to care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| What we're going to be left with, though, is how do we absorb this recurring expense, right, in our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2649)|
| 0:44:23| And we talked about this during our budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| Two percent raise, that begins in January, costs $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| Well, we're already starting out 1.3 in the hole next year, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| because we didn't budget for the hole 2.6 for that two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| So you're starting off in the hole there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| We already talked about the increase in UOP, which is 1.6 for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| So you're $3 million in the hole next year before you even do anything, right, before you even start preparing a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| Those two things tell you you're in the hole $3 million before you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| And I'm sure there's more, and she would tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| So that's kind of the things I look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| I agree with you on the grand scheme of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| You look at that number and you say, that don't seem like a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| But then you think about the reality of building that in year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| It gets tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| And so that's the challenging part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Yeah, and I understand the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| The challenge is we don't have enough revenue to warrant the expenses that are needed to support a growing county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| individual departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Commissioner Ward's right, and we've all been talking about it for years, and we know that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| I think, to me, I look at it as what happens if you don't invest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| Do we end up spending more down the road if we don't invest at the right levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| Just like roads, just like schools, just like everything else, the longer you defer the inevitable, the more expensive it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2761)|
| 0:46:09| And in this case, with our law enforcement professionals, you're talking about either losing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| If you lose more people that are eligible for retirement, it's going to cost you twice as much to backfill that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2776)|
| 0:46:23| If you lose five more recruits because they've gone to a sister agency, then you've got to spend twice as much time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| and everything compounds to a point where this is preventative maintenance in some sense from a workforce perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| And so I look at it as not how can we do it, but how can we not do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| I mean, are we going to spend $3, $4, $5, $6 million if we don't equip the team that has the highest liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| and the highest risk to our county all at the exact same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| I mean, I struggle with this, and let me ask you a separate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| Every year at the end of the year, we balance the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| We sort of share things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| We use designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| We try to use those for sort of one-time capital expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| But could we not use our designations to also fund the next year of this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| Yes, it will put us in a more precarious position next year, but, I mean, this is not going away just because we have a flat year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2839)|
| 0:47:31| I mean, in theory, yes, you could do that from a designation standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| Keep in mind in this budget we've already said we're going to use the first $2 million, so that number then increases, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| And then where do we end up the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| I think designations, in reality, we don't think about it this way as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2875)|
| 0:48:04| I mean, I think we do, but ultimately a lot of people don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| They just see, oh, wow, here's some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| How can we spend it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| And so the question is, does it come because there was a one-time revenue source that led to that increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| Two, did it come about because some expenses were not expensed through the year that will be there next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| I think that's things you have to examine to see what leads to a designation to end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2909)|
| 0:48:42| You know, ultimately, my thought is, is it something that we can look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2922)|
| 0:48:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| I mean, my thought would be, you know, you could approve this budget as is, and then let's end this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2932)|
| 0:49:02| Let us see how we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| See where designations get to, and is that something that we want to use designations for going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| I think that's a conversation that we can have when we talk about designations, which is usually in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2950)|
| 0:49:20| In our finance, I'm just trying to figure out if that time is up with our finance committee meeting to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2960)|
| 0:49:31| Next finance committee meeting will be August 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| So do you feel like we'll have that information by then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| I don't want Perry and Jennifer throwing things at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| Technically, we don't close until the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| We always bring designations in August, so we will have a pretty good idea how we will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| because we'll get sales tax in hopefully the 18th, and we'll be still accruing some property tax, but it's usually small by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| So I think by then, we'll have an idea of what designations are going to be, and we can show you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| okay, here's some list of requests that we've received, and how do we prioritize those, and think about this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3008)|
| 0:50:17| Okay, so there is a mechanism in which we could review that and consider this as a budget amendment as being funded by designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3017)|
| 0:50:27| Yeah, I think what we would want to do is to see how it ends, where that what I call one-time revenue over expense came from, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3027)|
| 0:50:40| So is it something that we have comfort in, or do we not have comfort in, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| And then what does that allow us the ability to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3046)|
| 0:50:54| Allison, between now and August, I'd like for you all to really nail down the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| What is the difference in what's budgeted versus what the request is from the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| What do the benefits look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| What is the impact on UOP, and what revenue potentials with additional contracts might offset that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3069)|
| 0:51:17| And Sheriff Spangler, if nothing else, I think we're on the precipice of passing this budget as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| but I'll commit to you that if I can get that information in advance and work with the finance team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| that when we come to our finance committee meeting in August, we'll take that up as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| At least I will, and bring it up as a priority discussion so that we can possibly look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| If we finish the year stronger, then we could do a budget amendment and retroactive that back to July 1, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| So I'll make that commitment to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| I think Commissioner Jay made some great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| The one thing additional that I'd like information on is how much money did we spend last year on recruiting and training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| since we did add 80-something officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| Because my fear is if the city goes up $5,000 on us, all of a sudden we're back to where we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| where we're losing officers and trying to spend more money again on recruiting and training, and it's just a vicious cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| I'd rather stay competitive, at least even, so that we can try to retain and be competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| instead of going back into the hole and spending, if we're spending $100,000 and we did 86 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| if you had to train every single one, that's $8.6 million right there that we just spent training all these people up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| So that's a considerable amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Comparison of 1.4, once you add in everything else, it's probably going to be closer to 1.8, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| when you add all the benefits and everything and all the retirement stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| I'm sitting here thinking about our county employees who are only getting 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3177)|
| 0:53:06| So whatever figures you're looking at, I think it's safe to say you will absolutely have to include an additional 2% for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3186)|
| 0:53:25| Is that a question or a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| It's really a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| You do this, and I see a riot with county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| So they have to be brought into the conversation and into the calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| So it's really just a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| Would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| I think we hear that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| It's not meant for disrespect, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| We hear that, and I think we can look in August and see where we are and what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3243)|
| 0:54:16| You've heard me say this, countywide, including all officers and everybody in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| excluding the officers who pay for their own, is about 1.3 million per percent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3263)|
| 0:54:32| And so just get that number in your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| It doesn't take long to get to the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| I think your point that you made is noted, and I'm glad that you made it, because if I didn't, then I may not get to my vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3281)|
| 0:54:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Mr. Caldwell, just two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| With the constraints of our current budget, are you and the mayor worried that some of our employees from the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3299)|
| 0:55:11| and the parks department could potentially jump ship to go to work for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3311)|
| 0:55:19| since their pay scales are just a little bit different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| I guess, you know, it's always a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| I think I'm not that close to that situation, so I may would ask Jim and Joe themselves if they've heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3331)|
| 0:55:43| I mean, we can ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| It may come as a surprise, but most time employees don't want to talk to me, and I'm a likable guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3347)|
| 0:55:55| I really get a complex about it, honestly, but Jim and Joe, you got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| We'll just ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| And while they're coming to the podium, the other question I had was, based on the inflation rate that we're currently under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| is it possible that next year's designations, when we close the books in June of 2025, that there could be zero dollars for designations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3373)|
| 0:56:25| I think it's very possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| I don't know if it would be zero, but I think it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| Let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| It depends on what we do this August, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| And so I would submit that if we stayed status quo, this year we'll probably be about half of what we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| and the next year it keeps on going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| But depending on what we do this August, I mean, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| And it also depends, of course, what revenue does, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| So business tax is really good right now, and that's what's helping us in the general fund is business tax a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| And property tax collections have been good, but things have slowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| And I sent out something last week that showed, like, the property tax is late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3422)|
| 0:57:12| So they've kind of slid off, and everything in that report last week was in the red and pointing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| And it gives you this very false sense of security, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| But current property tax has still been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| We have saw a decrease month over month from the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| But our collections through February was really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| But I do think we're going to see a shrinking of designations no matter what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| Yeah, I'll speak to it real quick, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| I guess over the last five years or so, I've probably lost, I don't know, six to eight folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| some to the school system and some to KUB, primarily CDL drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| You know, once you get a CDL, you're really, you have a lot more options open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| So we have lost a few folks to our peer agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| Joseph Mack, Senior Director of Parks and Recreation for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| I've only lost one in the last two and a half years to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| Are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| Seeing none, I will adjourn this meeting and regular commission will begin at 510.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-public-hearing?start=3521)|
