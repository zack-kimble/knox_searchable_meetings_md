| 0:06:58| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=419)|
| 0:06:59| How long have you been at that address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Well, my dad and mom started that business back in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| and then they let my brother, which is Deo Thomas Filipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| and I, they let us take over the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| And honestly, I like the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| and my brother does nursing and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| so I've decided to become the manager and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| and run the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| And we've decided that it's about time that we expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| and grow the business into a certain just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| we sell only packaged goods and do export out of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| for boxes and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| So now we're thinking about selling beards and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| and then probably in a few years we'll probably do restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| and probably do import and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| That business is actually very close to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| I think the last time I was in there, I was riding my bicycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| and I got a can of coconut water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=473)|

| 0:08:03| about, you can sell coconut water, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| but just be careful with sales to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| And la cosa mas importante es tener cuidado con las ventas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| de las minores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=494)|

| 0:08:33| Correct, yes, but we did a little bit of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| and stuff like that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=516)|

| 0:12:06| than I originally had planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| so I had to redo the sewer and water lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| and put an extra bathroom in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| so it's just been taking a little longer than I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| Okay, where exactly on Sutherland are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=735)|

| 0:14:18| find themselves singing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=858)|

| 0:16:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| All right, so that brings us back to O'Rourke's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| and I'm presuming I didn't see anybody walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| He was doing his taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| That's when I spoke with him, so I don't know if that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| That can be a stressful time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Yeah, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| This has been going on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1001)|

| 0:16:47| but I think they have stayed in contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I think my inclination is to extend for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| and give them time to get back in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| but I need to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1019)|

| 0:17:04| This has happened a time or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Full disclosure, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1028)|

| 0:17:34| I just wanted to share some stats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| kind of year over year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| just sort of what we've encountered over this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| In 2021, there were 108 beer permits were issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| and in 2022, there were 88,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| but there are actually 19 still pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| so that would bring us to 107,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| so almost the same year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| In 2021, there were 34 off-premise permits issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| for special events, and 2022, 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| so down quite a bit on special event permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| and then there were 40...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| In 2021, 43 violations occurred for sale of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| to persons under 21 years of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| which were all a result of sting operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| In 2022, that was down by 736, which is good news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1106)|
| 0:18:35| and then in 2021, there were 42 other violations occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| including the use of false IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| along with underage consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| and in 2022, that was substantially more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| with 64 with the use of false IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| along with underage consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| and both those last were a result of sting operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| so just thought I would share those stats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| as we kind of look at 2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| and see how it's stacked up year over year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| so any questions on that or thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| All right, if there's no other business, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230124?start=1152)|
