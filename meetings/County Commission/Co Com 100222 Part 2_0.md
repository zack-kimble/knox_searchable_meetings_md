| 0:05:46| We are placing a 100-day moratorium expiring August 31, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| on the issuance of first-time beer permits for drive-through businesses located in unincorporated Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| 903-10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| 903-10-0 to approve. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| The reason I pulled this off is a citizen wanted to speak on this matter, and that's Carl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| Carl, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| My name is Harold Hudson, 12800 Lodgepole Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:31| Currently, I own a drive-through business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| It's off of John Sevier on the corridor of Old Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| And my concern was, I've not seen the total ordinance now, it's a little bit different situation than a window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| What this is, you actually drive your car into the business and you can buy a number of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| If I was to sell that business, my concern is that the person that owns it after that could not get a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=413)|
| 0:07:03| and it would be necessary for them to get a beer permit to run that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| If I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the Board, to respond to this gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| Tennessee law essentially reads that if there is a preexisting lawfully issued license, then we could not deny a subsequent license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| So in that particular instance, this ordinance would not affect current holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| and it would not affect current holders who attempt to sell the business if the license is in effect at that time and valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Yes, sir, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| I would just like to, so I'm covered there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| But I would like to say a couple of other things about our particular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| I know there's some, I guess, statistics or something out there that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| the clerk behind the register can see somebody walking into a store, and if they're staggering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| and then they talk to them at the register, they can tell whether that person is intoxicated or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| But at my store, a person has to drive in their automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| There's a number of times they've come through and already cracked one open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| You know, a clerk cannot see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| We can because we're right up next to the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Ask them what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| What we can also tell is whether there's a bunch of kids in that car that's going to be drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| If you go into a convenience store or supermarket, usually the person that is old enough will go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| and buy it for everybody and bring it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| At our store, if there was two 16-year-old girls in the back and two 21-year-old boys in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| and they get a case of beer and two six-packs of wine coolers, we'll ask everybody for an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| So I would like to see, because I thought about opening up a couple more of these in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:57| to where they pass at its more or less windows instead of driving into establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| and clarify the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| As most of you all know, we've been discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| this is one of the items that we've been discussing in our joint beer workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| because this is the area where we have the most problems with the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| When I saw this on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| I immediately asked Commissioner Andrews if I could join with him and several others, as you can see, have also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| But since then have found out that according to the state laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| even a moratorium could be questionable legally, but we cannot do a permanent ban according to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=589)|
| 0:09:59| Is that correct, Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Well, sir, state law essentially provides two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| Our courts have consistently held that primary control over the retail sale of beer is vested in the local government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| But it likewise reads that if someone has all the qualifications enumerated in an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| and they meet all the criteria, they should be issued a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And if they don't, they have redress in the form of approaching the local court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| And the courts will generally have a jaundiced look, if you will, at a moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| unless they are of limited duration for a limited purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| This moratorium, as has been explained to me by Commissioner Andrews and yourself and other sponsors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| is that it's for a limited purpose to study the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| to determine whether or not it's injurious to the health, welfare, and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Now, it may ultimately require a change in statutory enactments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| In other words, we may have to get our state legislative delegation to take a look at Chapter 57 of the Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| But this would not affect current holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| or those who have businesses that don't meet the criterion or have a preexisting license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| But it does give you the opportunity to look at it from a health, welfare, and safety standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| which is the long answer to a short question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| A follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| According to this gentleman, he said he could possibly open two or three more of these like this one or drive two types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| I know, based on what we've talked about so far, that his current business is going to be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| But if he opens up two or three more, that's not his current business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| That's not really an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| It's additional, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| For additional ones, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| I think the distinguished, what he's describing is a bit of an oddity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| I think the intent, and I'm not going to read into the legislative intent of the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| but the intent of these entities where a person pulls up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| somebody opens a window, and they communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| His is basically like a tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| It's a drive-in, and they're surrounded on both sides where the clerk actually has a face-to-face encounter with the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| In some states, they call those beverage castles because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| it's not someone pulling up to an external window but pulling into the entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| where they have a confrontation with a clerk who can actually observe them, possibly assess them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| So it is a bit of a distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| But whether or not you want to draw that distinction is up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Well, in his case, in his defense, on one hand, it is quite unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| If any of you all have not seen it, you actually drive into the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| and the waitress comes out like at the old Southern Circle Drive-in or Babe Malloy's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| or whatever it was you guys had out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| That's the two we had out south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| And she actually, she or he actually comes out and looks, you know, into the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| They have a little bit better chance at observing there than they do in another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| But I'd like to point out, too, that I believe it was just last month they were fined for selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| and then actually did find out that somehow the first one didn't get handled correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| But this particular location has had two violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| So it all comes down to the individual doing the checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| That's what it comes down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| Training, training, training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| It's the only thing that's going to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Well, I'm glad I'm not running this year because I'm going to tell you, I was young once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| Like most young men, I drank beer before I was old enough to drink beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| The thing that me and my friends when I was in high school all knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| was that if you went to the package store with the drive-up window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| you would have a far better chance of being served than if you went to a place that you walked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| Just up from my business was a package store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Really nice man that ran it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| I'm not going to say his name, but he was a pillar of the community in other respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| I don't know that he necessarily sold young people beer on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| It may have been that he was an older gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| and he couldn't see and check IDs through the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| And in those days, people were less open about the fact that they consumed beverages, adult beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| So at the drive-throughs, it worked a little quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| You drove up, you paid, and they gave you your beer and you drove off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| But for whatever reason, young people were more likely to be able to buy beer in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| And now today, you know, as an adult and serving on the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:55| I look and I see that we have a higher percentage of drive-throughs that have been cited for serving minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| And, in fact, sir, you look awfully familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Have you been before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| You have not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Okay, you just had a familiar face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| But, I mean, here's my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Nobody's asking to shut these things down permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| And I certainly don't want to run anybody out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| and am glad that your business would be grandfathered in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| But I think we need to take this time and we need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| Is there a correlation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Maybe it's not the fact that it's drive-throughs that's causing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| Maybe there's some other reason that's causing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Maybe it's the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| But if we take this moratorium, what we're saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| is we're not going to issue any more licenses to this type of store for a certain amount of time while we study the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| And, sir, I would hope that while we're studying that situation that you might offer some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| If you're in that business, maybe you can look at what you do and what your competitors do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| and see if maybe there's some other regulations that could be suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| But it's just what I'm noticing is things haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| When I was a kid, everybody went to the place with the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| And now, based on what I'm seeing sitting on billboard, young people still go to the place with the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| And all we're trying to do is stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| And if there's a way to stop it, yet continue to allow this type of establishment, then I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| Because I don't want to hurt anybody's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| But all we're asking you to vote for today is a temporary moratorium while we study the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| And, sir, I would hope that you and others in your industry might be able to help us come up with some solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| that would help stop this kind of thing that would also, in turn, not affect your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| Yeah, I do have some suggestions how that could be fixed for kids that come in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| and try to buy beer and give a fake ID or their real ID and try to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| One way is just allow the clerks to keep the ID and call the police and make a copy of it and report it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| And where the kid gets arrested for trying to buy beer for underage, I don't know if that's a current law or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| And I've always thought that that would be if an ID was going to be confiscated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| and most convenience stores now have video so that there's actually evidence that could be turned over to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| If maybe if the young people were, you know, if we started charging young people that that might, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| I think a couple of parents have to pay a fine for their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| It might stop that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| And I will tell you, we do card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| The times that we got caught was the times that they read the ID wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| And my wife is getting software for the computer system where they have to put the ID in now to verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| She thought it said 89, I mean 87, and it said 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| You know, it's a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| You know, we shouldn't have sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| But I can assure you that we have turned away more people than the two places down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| from what we can see in the automobiles, more so than they cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| I mean, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| You said you wanted to expand your franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Do you have some locations in mind now that you or are you just hoping to expand your franchise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| No, we've actually been looking down Oak Ridge Highway, and we've also been looking at some places on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| When we bought that particular business, the, you know, with the economy at that time, you know, land prices were high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| But you don't pursue this 180 day moratorium hurting your potential to franchise your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| No, not with this 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Actually, we were just kind of worried about what's going on with this and just wanted to be heard by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| I would encourage you to get with Commissioner Brown and go to the joint city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| and county beer workshop that they're having and kind of express your views there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| That would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Because I can guarantee you there's a lot of stuff goes on that people just don't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| with all these different things going on in the cars that we can point out and tell them no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| And I know they go right down the street and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| Commissioner Brown, when is that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| When's the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| She was telling me to tell you when it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| It will be March the 15th at 1 o'clock in room 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| That's on the sixth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| I'm going to give you my card here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| I have something forward that said if the kid gets caught buying beer that their parents are going to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| you know, trying to buy beer, the parents are going to get fined $5,000 or $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| and make them come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| That will possibly quit some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| I just want to say, Lumpy, that I'm shocked, absolutely shocked at what you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| But actually, I think that this is a great idea to include some of the business owners into the conversation that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:31| And I hope that we'll invite more than just this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| I think that the business owners probably have seen things that we don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| and have better ideas than we could come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| Are you shocked that I suggested him go to a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| I'm shocked that he could possibly do anything wrong when he was underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1247)|

| 0:21:07| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| requesting for Senate to resolution R08-12-908,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| that a representative of Hillcrest appear before the Commission to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| No, no, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| We have a representative from Hillcrest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| Mr. Chairman, my name is William Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| My address is 3560 Talahi Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| I'm the chair of the Hillcrest Health Care Board of Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| and I appreciate the opportunity to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Hillcrest is a Tennessee public benefit corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| It's recognized as a 501c3 charitable organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| The board is made up of volunteers from the community who serve without compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| Hillcrest's purpose is to provide residential nursing home care for this county's senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:19| Hillcrest operates three facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| Hillcrest South has 95 beds with 106 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| Hillcrest North has 271 employees and 365 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:38| Hillcrest West has 194 nursing home beds and 28 assisted living beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:47| Hillcrest is not an agency of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| It's not a unit of government, but Knox County provides critical support to Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| by providing the buildings in which our three facilities are located under a seven-year lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| that we pay a dollar a year for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| The current lease term will end June 30, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| Despite the age of the buildings and the very real maintenance costs, utility costs, facility replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:25| and operational issues associated with those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| Hillcrest is greatly advantaged by the county's making those buildings available to us for area seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:41| We last appeared before this commission in 2008 when we described both clinical care and financial concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:52| Thereafter, to address both of those concerns, the Hillcrest board entered into a management contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| with Grace Healthcare, a Chattanooga business, to operate the nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| We selected Grace for three reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Its reputation and experience in successfully managing more than 40 nursing homes across Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| and in other southeastern states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Second, because it had successfully brought underperforming nursing homes up to par.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| And third, because its management philosophy and approach fit Hillcrest's mission well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| Grace assumed the management responsibility for Hillcrest on April 1, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| Under the contract, Hillcrest continues to own the business and the licenses for the beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| There's no change in the county's ownership of the real property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| and there's no change in Hillcrest's responsibility as the tenant under the lease we have with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| Except for the nursing home administrators, which are the senior managers at each of the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| we agreed with Grace that all of the employees of Hillcrest would remain Hillcrest employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:14| The three nursing home administrators are Grace employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| With one exception, I think the management arrangement has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| Hillcrest's financial position has improved with Grace's management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| The south and north facility have been surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| and issues identified by the surveyors have been addressed to the satisfaction of the regulators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| Despite those positive things that have resulted, I'm very disappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:51| as has, of course, been publicly reported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| that the improvements we made with Grace's help were not sufficient at West to satisfy the state and federal regulators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1555)|
| 0:26:06| Therefore, effective March 8, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| West's Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements are being terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| This means that Hillcrest will not be reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid for care provided after that date three weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:30| West will remain open and will continue to serve residents who are private pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| However, we'll not be able to serve Medicare and Medicaid residents after March 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| We're working with the state and with other area nursing homes to place West's Medicare and Medicaid residents elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:56| As of last Friday, February 19th, there were 28 residents at West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| 13 of whom are Medicare or Medicaid residents who'll need to move between now and March 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:14| 46 residents have been relocated from West to either Hillcrest North or Hillcrest South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:23| West's loss of the Medicare and Medicaid provider agreement is most unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| It's creating a hardship on affected residents and their families that I regret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| We're committed to complying with all state and federal regulations and requirements in connection with the transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| and our focus for the last weeks has been to find placements locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| To date, except to meet resident and family requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| all residents who have been relocated have been relocated within a 60-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:04| We believe the remaining residents can also be placed within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| Because any Medicaid residents remaining at West after March 8th will lose their Medicaid eligibility for all medical services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:22| it's really not a viable option for us or for a Medicaid resident to remain at Hillcrest after March 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:32| At the state's request, a meeting was organized, scheduled for last Tuesday, February 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:40| with residents, family members, representatives of West's residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| The state was to present its survey findings at that meeting and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| Unfortunately, due to the remarkable weather, the inclement weather on the 16th, the state had to cancel their attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1734)|
| 0:29:04| Although since the meeting was already organized, we went ahead with it at West with the families and residents who showed up at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:17| We told them that the state has rescheduled their meeting for March 2nd at 1.30 to talk to family members and residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:30| That meeting will be Tuesday next week, March 2nd at 1.30 at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:39| Because of the residents who've been transferred to North or South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| Hillcrest has been able to reassign some former West employees to either the North or South facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:55| Some employees will remain at West to serve the smaller number of private pay residents that we'll have going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:04| Inevitably, however, we will have many fewer residents in Hillcrest care after March 8th, and we will have fewer total employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:20| So in addition to the impacts on residents and family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| the impact on individual employees is another most regrettable part of the loss of these Medicare and Medicaid contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:36| Some of the very dedicated employees who worked so hard over the last several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| and years to bring West up to an acceptable quality of care to meet survey requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| are now the very employees who will suffer the consequence of the transfer of these residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| These are good, caring employees who serve this community well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| and I hope other health care organizations in the area will provide them with the positions that they certainly deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| I can't emphasize how hard we've worked over the last several years to make West a compliant facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| The result doesn't detract from my appreciation for the public officials, for the commissioners, for other board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:28| employees, volunteers, people at Grace, both their employees and management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| who have all made an extraordinary effort to achieve full compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| The board was directly involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Grace assigned a very capable and qualified nursing home administrator to work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| and absolutely poured resources into that nursing home in an effort to meet all requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| As an example, at one point Grace had four corporate level registered nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| and licensed health care administrators working with every aspect of the nursing systems at West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| to improve the quality of care there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| The board members and officers of Hillcrest have met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and talked to both federal and state regulators on multiple occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| and we're pursuing Hillcrest's legal rights as appears most productive to our long-term ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| So after March 8th, Hillcrest will remain open as a private pay facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| We'll apply for Medicaid recertification as soon as permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| We believe that the facility will be eligible for a licensure survey by the state 90 days after the decertification on March 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:56| but the state will determine what the actual timing for that survey will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| In stating our intentions to remain open as a private pay facility and to seek recertification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| I don't want to minimize the financial difficulty caused by the loss of revenue associated with the beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| that will not be occupied at West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| and the importance of our being able to promptly rebuild appropriate nursing systems and clinical controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| to show the state that we can and will provide proper care at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| The board will continuously assess the progress made toward reestablishing West's Medicaid contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:42| and will develop appropriate contingency plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| If we're not making progress within our financial resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| we'll have to consider any other reasonable options so long as we preserve the senior resident beds for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2031)|
| 0:34:03| Jim Murphy, who's the president of Hillcrest, is with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| Last week, we provided the commission with copies of the latest audited financial reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| and the most recent state surveys for each of the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| Jim and I would be glad to answer questions that the commission might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Yes, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| You know, we met almost two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I was expecting you at the finance committee meeting last Monday because, you know, we talked like you'd be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| But at the time when we met, I believe that you said there were about 45 patients down there on Medicaid, Medicare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| And you agreed to pay out of Hillcrest would pay to take care of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| even though you weren't going to get checks from the federal government, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| You get them placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| I told you that we would go off with your request and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| And, frankly, Commissioner, if it was a matter of keeping a particular resident at West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| because they couldn't move to a satisfactory facility, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| The problem is, as I stated earlier, if a Medicaid resident stays in our facility after March 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:29| they don't just lose reimbursement for our care, which we can stand for the few people who are left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:39| but they lose Medicaid coverage for all their medical services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| which I think making a judgment for them is too risky for any individual person who's already on Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:53| By definition, they don't have other medical resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| I must have misunderstood you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| I thought you said Hillcrest would pick up that tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I must have misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| You moved patients to out north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| How many patients did you move out north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Forty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Forty patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| How many personnel, people that work for Hillcrest, did you send out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Do you know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| How many employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Thirty so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Thirty so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| The reason why I'm asking you this, north is not an FF, you know, special focus facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| but they have also had the lowest rating in Medicare with the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| that there is that you can possibly get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| They're rated one star, according to Medicare.gov, if you want to go and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| So how is that going to help north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| North may possibly get in the same shape as west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| With respect, Commissioner, I think that the answer is that we have a good overall management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| for Hillcrest and a good management system at north and that north is improving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:17| that north has been surveyed in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| It hasn't had perfect surveys, but it's not had the kind of problems that we've had at west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:32| and I'm confident that they can take on those additional residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| and additional employees and continue to improve the quality of care that they provide at north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:47| Well, Bill, it doesn't seem like they've improved it in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| They've still got the worst rating the government can give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| The Hillcrest overall has improved, and the care at each of the facilities has improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2272)|
| 0:38:02| As I said, I'm very disappointed that we weren't able to satisfy the regulators at west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| but I'm confident about the quality of care at both north and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:17| Well, west was a special focus facility for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| You didn't bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Serene Manor here got them coming under a special focus facility February 2nd, I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| They've already met the criteria that they asked for, and they're already out from in under the special focus facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| Why could west not come out of this in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| We worked really hard over 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| and I'm very disappointed that we weren't able to graduate from the special focus facility program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| Well, Bill, you know Hillcrest tried to buy this for $6 million in 2007, all three facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| and, of course, I stood against it and said they couldn't pay for it because they didn't have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| They came back up here in December and dropped that, I believe it was, December of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| and said if we'd give them $150,000, I believe that's the correct amount of money, they could turn it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| They were back up here in March of 2008 and said they wanted to take grace on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| because they need someone to come in and turn it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Apparently grace didn't do it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| But I'm concerned also about this pay-for-pay at west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| I believe, and I don't remember who it was, I believe it might have been Commissioner Brolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| that made the statement up here that she wanted this to stay non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| I guess this question here would be directed for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| So how does that affect our contract if they're making a for-pay facility out of west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:11| So your contract, in terms of the terms and conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| doesn't really get into the day-to-day business operations of the entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| unless they violate any code, ordinance, or law of any governmental body or agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| So point being, if it is clear that there has been a violation of a local, federal, or state ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:33| code of regulations, et cetera, that would constitute breach of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| Well, it certainly looks to me like it's been that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Bill, would you all be willing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| I'm sure you have three licenses for all three facilities, a different license for each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| It seems to me like that Grace and Hillcrest has their hands full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| going to have their hands full just trying to get north up much below average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| and south is just average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Would there be any way that you think you might could relinquish the west facility down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| and we could get someone else in down there maybe and get a license sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| to where we could help these people in Knox County that need nursing home facilities to go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| We talked to the federal regulator who was the ultimate decision maker about the revocation of these contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:42| and asked her about several different alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| One of them specifically was if the operator of the nursing home at west was someone other than us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:59| could we avoid this license or this contract termination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| And the answer was absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| I think that the systems that Grace has put into north and south and was installing at west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:24| and the resources they've devoted to this effort will pay off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| and I'd ask that the commission agree to allow Hillcrest to continue to work at that west facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:42| for a reasonable period of time and show you that we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| Are you covered in under these federal laws when it's for pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Well, the government come in and quit paying on Medicaid and Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| because they have certain rules and guidelines you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Does that apply to for pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Apparently it doesn't if you can keep for pay patients down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Do you make more money off for pay than you do Medicaid and Medicare patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| Certainly more than we make off of Medicaid patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Medicare would depend on the particular severity of a particular resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:34| You would agree that a for profit nursing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| one that doesn't have a 5013C, operate for profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| that they pay taxes to Knox County, property taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| You would agree that they have to take Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| and Medicare patients as they sign up just like Hillcrest West and north and south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| I think the commission has heard the debate about that requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| as well as the way it's implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| Well, I believe that you agreed to take 66% would be Medicaid and Medicare patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| I believe the average in the state of Tennessee is 66%, so you're just average there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| But you would have to agree that if I'm going to use, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| a breakable nursing home, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| if I'm Medicaid and Medicare and I go down there and sign up to get a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| and I'm on Medicaid and Medicare and I need to go into that home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| and Mr. Brown here beside me comes down there and he's for pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| that they still have to take me before they can't jump him over me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| You would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| There's a law on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| There's certainly regulations about how nursing homes take patients, residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| I can't understand how a nursing home like Breakable, look at them, they're paying taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:04| and I feel like we're subsidizing Hillcrest with taxes that they don't have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| and we built the buildings and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| But they're paying taxes and now the possible five-star rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| which is the highest that the government can give you, that they're rated four stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| Subsidizing Hillcrest, west is gone now, north is a one star,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:28| the worst rating they can give you, and south is two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| I just feel like our citizens of Knox County, the elderly people in these nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| when we're subsidizing you, the working people out here are subsidizing Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| that we deserve better care for our elderly people than that, what they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| I'd like to see some big changes made, and I don't know what they are, but I'm not trying to crow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| but I said last March what was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| And now we were convinced that Grace could turn this around, but here we are almost into March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| and they haven't even got it out from in under the special focus facility yet, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| So Serene Manor gets rolled up February 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| They're already out and been under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| There's some bad management somewhere in Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| Mr. Mason, I just need to return to some of your opening remarks there for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| You are here in what capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| You are the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| I'm the chair of the Hillcrest Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| And the Board of Directors is made up of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Community volunteers who serve without compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| And the other thing, excuse me, but when you were listing patients and employees and all, I got turned around somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2814)|
| 0:47:02| Could you go back and revisit those numbers with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| I believe you had six numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| It's like patients and employees at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| I gave you south has 95 beds and 106 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:19| North has 271 beds and 365 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| West has 194 nursing home beds and 28 assisted living beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| And Commissioner Wright, I don't know how many employees West has today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| And that was really going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| Are these numbers that were before the movement of patients started taking place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| Those are numbers of licensed beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| They're the beds we pay bed tax on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| And so at south, south is typically 94% full prior to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2874)|
| 0:48:04| North has been 84% full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| As we said, we've moved 40 residents to north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| And so north's percentage now is, of course, much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| Also, Mr. Chairman, I don't know exactly where we're headed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| This resolution is calling for Hillcrest to appear during this noticed meeting to respond to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:35| And I'm sure there are lots of questions around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| I also further notice that it's directed to Ms. Carolyn Poynter, the next paragraph down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| but Ms. Poynter has not been with the organization since when, October, November, or earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:56| It doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Summer of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| There have been changes of at least three overall leaders of the three sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| And now there is a new leader of the actual site out west, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| I think that probably what we're asking here is probably going to work itself out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| and that people get asked all the questions they need to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| But I would like to offer motion that we defer whatever action we're going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:34| in determination of what these contracts should be for 120 days or until the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| Mr. Law Director, Commissioner Pinkston sort of went down, started to go down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:05| We have a lease agreement with Hillcrest for three separate facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| Can we terminate just one of these, such as West?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| Can we terminate our lease contract with them over just that particular site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| and continue on with the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| The way your contract reads, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| it essentially requires Hillcrest to provide certain services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| and then it lists distinctly your separate entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| So I think the argument could be made that because they're actually not treated in the aggregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| but singularly as separate entities, that that's a possibility, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| So that is one of our possibilities as we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| So we could just terminate just for that facility if we so choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| I think 120 days is a little long, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| I mean, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| The only reason I offer that is because they're saying the state's taking 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| And that's immediately, that's the next obviously immediate point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| which we can ask them to come and respond about their status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Unless you want them to come every month, they could come every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| I assume they come back every month because if we're hearing reports back that they're not going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| I mean, things are still not going well or whatever, I would like to go ahead and be able to act immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| If you're offering that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| So if you would just like to defer until any action be deferred until next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| I would feel much more comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| Because I just don't want our hands to be tied for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| If I could, Mr. Chairman, and excuse me, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| just so you know, under your termination terms and conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| it essentially reads that the non-breaching party, in other words, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| has to essentially give Hillcrest, put them on notice as to the breach, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| Therefore, the opportunity to remedy the breach within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Now, it appears from Mr. Mason's comments, if you will, that that's probably not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| That being the case, if they agree to an earlier termination, then obviously that would be null and void anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| But if there's no probability of remedying any of the deficiencies within 90 days, then the breach is automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| Or in the alternative, we can shorten that by mutual dissent of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| But you do have some specific language as to termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| In other words, you can't terminate today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| You have to go through the procedural hoops to which you've contracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Would that be before we even start the clock of 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| Well, it reads that you have to give notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| Now, technically, you can give notice today, and that would essentially start the clock ticking, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| On the 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| So if we waited 120 days, then we would have to wait at that point to start the 90 days, and I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:25| I really think we need to try to do something, although I'm not sure what we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| Commissioner Leuthold, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Or I guess can I ask Dr. Mason a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Does the state give any quarterly reports to the feds, whoever is going to reissue your certification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| Do they give you any reports as to where you're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| Is there a preliminary evaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Or is there anything within this 90-day period that's going to lead us to believe you're doing well or not well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| Commissioner Anders, I don't understand that that's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| I understand that after 90 days, we're entitled to reapply and that the state will then schedule a relicensure survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3236)|
| 0:54:08| of course, without consulting with us as to when they're going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| So there's no way to measure progress, is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Well, and I guess that brings up the question, you have to wait 90 days to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| They could take however long they wish to take before they issue you your license back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:32| Yes, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| And we still wouldn't even know whether or not you would, even after that whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| we still wouldn't know whether or not you would get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| You could be turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Mr. Mason, from what I've been told, the biggest part of the problems in West were record-keeping, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:12| It wasn't necessarily in care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| It was more in record-keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| I don't want to fuss, Commissioner, over the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| Documentation in a nursing home of the care is an important part of the care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| I've had several relatives in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| But you all were notified of this over a year ago, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| Yes, in July of 2008, 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| We were in the special focus facility program for 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Well, now, you haven't been into that for 18 months, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| I mean, you have, but Grace has not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| Grace has been with us since April 1st of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| So it's a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Eleven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Eleven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Well, it's Houston and Harris anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| My point is, whether it's Grace with 11 months or Hillcrest with 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| there's not been any progress in getting this thing straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| Anybody who is in business, if you have somebody in a leadership manager position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:32| that cannot correct that kind of problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| then it's necessary to make a change somewhere along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| and find somebody that can do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| I agree that that is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| I don't agree with the statement that no progress has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Well, let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| There's not enough progress made to make a difference on your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| We're not able to satisfy the surveyors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| Well, another thing that bothers me is when I look at the ratings of all three Hillcrests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:09| when you have to struggle to be the worst of the worst just to get on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:19| that's not saying a whole lot for your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Now, what can you do to assure us that that's not going to happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Before you answer that, I'll let you get back to it in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| You know, part of the agreement, the way I remember it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| was that when we leased this to Hillcrest for this dollar a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| it was to provide indigent care for citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| That was part of the agreement, that you all would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| In order to do that, you had to have Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| I was getting a voice message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| I don't know what's wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| It went off and I can't get it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:09| You're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| It's coming on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| It's coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| In order to do that, I lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:25| In order to be able to take care of those, you have to have your certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| If you don't have that certification, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| that is a breach of the contract that you have with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| And it would seem to me that we could call any part of that agreement we want as a breach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:47| And if we have to split it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| if the lawyers can't agree that we can't cut off one part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| we could cancel the whole contract and let you renegotiate the first two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| There's ways to do it if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| But what I'm concerned about here is how dedicated are you folks to getting this thing turned around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| and how can you assure us it's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| I tried to make clear in my statement that I cannot assure you that it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| This is a difficult process that we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| and we have to be able to survive with West with very low occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| We have to be able to survive financially during this 90-plus day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| I think that we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| and I think that Grace and our directors of nursing and our nurses and employees at all of the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3590)|
| 1:00:04| are working hard to continuously improve the quality of care that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:12| But I am not going to stand here and assure you that it's going to work out over the next 90 or 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| We're going to work hard to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| Well, there are several of us sitting up here today who, with tongue in cheek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| went out on a limb to support your organization over there a year or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| And I'm not sure that I can assure you we're going to be ready to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| So where does that leave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| I think that we're having a frank exchange of what the realities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| Well, I want you to know we're upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| I want to follow up on what Commissioner Brown said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| He came to us a while back with a contract, and certain assurances were made and not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:11| There was sort of an assurance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| There was a fragile tissue of trust that has been broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Go to Medicare.gov, as Paul alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| Hillcrest West, special focus facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Nursing homes that have a persistent poor quality of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| Hillcrest North, one star out of five in danger of becoming the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| Hillcrest South, two stars out of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Hillcrest Health Care Center, same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| And the lowest scores have been for health inspection and staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| These are troubling results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| I don't know that assurances matter anymore once that fragile tissue of trust has been broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| There was a difficult vote for a lot of us, and we're disappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| and that's the most kind word I can say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| So here's where I think we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| I listened to Dave's idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| I listened to Craig's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| I think the most reasonable course of action is for us to state that in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| put on our agenda for our next meeting a motion to start the 90-day clock to, in effect, revoke the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:22| Put them on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Put them on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| And I think that is our most reasonable action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| To defer any action for 30 days so one or more of us can introduce resolutions to, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| give them the 90-day notice regarding the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| And I think that's the most logical course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| One of the rare occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| That would be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| I believe in parliamentary, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Everybody wants to go look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| It's www.medicare.gov and go and compare nursing homes, and you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| I checked them all in the 25-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Let me tell you something, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| I checked this the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| Special focus facility, and I didn't make the rules like I told a certain commissioner here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| said he didn't think anybody's life was in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| The government says on their rules if you're a special focus facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| the patients are in immediate jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Check it on, see what medicare.gov says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| I didn't set those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| And we were told nobody was in immediate jeopardy or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| Nobody was going to die by commissioner year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| Three weeks later, north, somebody dies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| And the coroner, county coroner, says it was homicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| They wasn't fed any water or food for nine days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| I didn't say that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| It was in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| The coroner said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Here's the thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| How long is it going to take you to get this turned around this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| That's, I think, the moral thing for Hillcrest to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| If you apply for an appeal, you're talking about 90 days before you can even apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| Yes, 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| All right, 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Then we don't know how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| If you turn loose of the west down there, maybe we could get someone else in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| that could get a license sooner to help the patients of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| and bring these people that have been Knox County taxpayers all their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| back into Knox County where their kids and people can be close to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| I think the moral thing to do would be for you to give up the west facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| and let us try to find someone to do it and work on bringing north up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:38| I believe there's a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| I won't be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| But one thing that, you know, I think there's several things that are frustrating to all of us about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| And, you know, I know you weren't in position at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3895)|
| 1:05:02| But one thing I'd like to see is a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| There has to be other entities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| You guys have a, I guess, a subcontractor, a partner from Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| How have other facilities gone from a one-star to a three-star| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| or a failing miserably status to a passing status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| So I would like to see, and what did they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| What was the infrastructure portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| What was the hiring practices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| What happened that took them from this dismal place, which you guys are at, I mean, by all accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:45| to a satisfactory stance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| Because I agree, you know, if we get 90 days to apply, but if you're still giving them, I mean, I'm being crass here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| but if you're giving them a, you know, garbage product in 90 days, we know what the answer is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| So I would like to see, if you'll come back next month, a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| or you can e-mail us a study of what successful institutions have done to get out of this hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| And I understand it's a hole and it's tough to get out of that when you have facilities that don't meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| and all these other things, but what exactly have they done to get out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Mr. Mason, I guess given the discussion, where it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| and in effect the fact that what we intend to do in 30 days apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| and then your 90 days subsequent to that, what does that cause you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| I mean, does that cause great trepidation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| Does that seem reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| If it does seem reasonable, something about what will likely take place from your perspective in that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:04| Thank you for that question, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| We've been focused since the last survey in January on meeting our obligations to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:21| and the federal government with regard to these residents who are in our care who need to be transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:28| We have not taken the time from that effort to focus on the kind of thing that Commissioner McKenzie is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:38| as to the details of the path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| The reason that we contracted with Grace is because they have successfully moved underperforming nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| both underperforming on a clinical basis and underperforming on a financial basis, into better areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4071)|
| 1:08:00| And I would be delighted to have the opportunity to come back in 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| and explain what the process is that we and Grace think will work at West to achieve the ends that we're seeking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:21| which is to get back in operation for the Medicaid residents in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Given where you are then and your anticipation of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| do you think that it's reasonable that you will be able to get the West facility back in compliance with the regulators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:47| That is our intent and the direction of our efforts, and I'm not going to promise you that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:55| I don't want to promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| I'm not going to make that promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| But it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I mean, otherwise you wouldn't take that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| Bill, you said that, what did you say, about 90 days for Medicare to get back with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| From, and Jim will correct me if I misstate this, March 8 is the last day that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:27| that our contract for Medicare, Medicaid is in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:35| 90 days after March 8 is the earliest we can apply to the state for, to reapply for Medicaid, not Medicare, Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4175)|
| 1:09:53| Medicaid is the state program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| 90 days from March 8 is the earliest we can apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| Thereafter, the state will schedule a survey, which is, you know, in their discretion to schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Bill, if you lose that certificate of need, Knox County may never get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| Truthfully, Commissioner, I don't know the process, but we don't want to lose the certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| This community needs those beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| That's absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| And we're in a possibility we could lose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| The state may never give it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| There should be, I'm going to say this, there should be no such thing as certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| The state shouldn't be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| If you want to open up a nursing home, they should set the rules and guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| But if we lose this, I'm telling you, Commissioners, this facility may never be opened again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| We've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| I don't know whether it's immediately or not, but I spoke up here the last time and told what I think is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| I'm telling you, if we lose this, we may never get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| I think that the moral thing for you to do or Hillcrest to do and the Board members would let us try to get somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| to take that facility over down there and apply for this while we still have a certificate of need there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| Now, that's my opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Now, if you don't want to do it morally and do this, then if we lose it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| it's going to rest on this Commission's back and Hillcrest's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| And I don't think we're asking too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| We've actually already lost that deal down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| We don't know that they're even going to grant you your licensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| But the certificate of need, we cannot afford to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| And that's what the State gives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Am I not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Hillcrest's mission is to provide care to senior residents, including the indigent Medicaid population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4316)|
| 1:12:05| including the population surrounding that Hillcrest West site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| I don't agree that in these difficult circumstances we should give up the effort to show that we can properly run that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:26| nursing home and re-staff it and fill those beds with the Medicaid population that needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:37| Well, you know, there's a little spin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| I don't know whether the rest of the Commission did it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| but it's everybody that has a nursing home and takes Medicaid and Medicare patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| they're there to serve the people, too, just like Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| That's their purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| But I'm telling you, if we lose this certificate of need and we possibly, Mr. McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:59| possibly instead of waiting 30 days, we need to have a special call meeting on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| and get back, say, in 15 days and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| And this is dangerous, I'm going to tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| If we lose that certificate of need, I've talked to state representatives and everything about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| and they've assured me that Knox County may never get it back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| So let's do what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| I've made my little pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| You know, Commissioner Mark Harmon talked about the trust that they gave to you folks to get this turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:48| I'm one of them that voted against extending the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| So you didn't necessarily, you didn't, I mean, you dashed my hopes because I was hoping they were right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| and hoped that you'd get it turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| But you didn't dash my trust because I didn't think you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| So as I look at this, how much of a burden is it going to be, a financial burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4446)|
| 1:14:15| to try to turn around the west facility when you could possibly be trying to take those same funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| and turn around the north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| I mean, to have a one star at north, you know, is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:32| So would you not be better off cutting your losses with the west facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:40| and concentrate where you still have a chance, I feel, to turn it around where you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:50| I don't think that that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| North is and has been improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| North hasn't, as I said, had perfect surveys, but north has done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| I'm confident about the care that's provided at north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| and I don't think that we need to not make the effort at west because of north's situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:21| Is there anything, if we wait a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| is there anything that you'll be able to tell us one month from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| about why we should not terminate the lease that you could tell us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| I mean, what will we know in a month that we won't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Because you'll have just started the clock here in a couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| so you'll only be a couple of weeks into the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| So what will we know in a month that we won't know today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| Without talking to the other members of the board and without talking to Grace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4555)|
| 1:16:04| I don't know that this is a complete answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| but my answer standing at the podium tonight is that a month from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| we'll be able to provide a plan for that 90-day period with details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:23| and I hope in a credible fashion that will allow the commission to have confidence that we're, as I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:33| that we can work through that 90-day period in a constructive fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| with a likelihood of going on with west operating in a way that satisfies the regulators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:49| and meets the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| Well, west just didn't get in trouble overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| I mean, west has been struggling for years, has it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| So I guess my trying to get my hands around is I'm not sure you're going to be able to come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:14| convince me a month from now that you have a plan that's going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| when it took years to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| West was put in the special focus facility program because of some bad surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:35| West has done much better and there has been a considerable improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:44| We didn't improve it enough to satisfy the regulators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| I don't want the commission to think that west was on a downward trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| because west wasn't on a downward trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| It was on an upward trend, and I'm confident that we can continue that upward trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:09| and satisfy the regulators and come back out of this hole that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| But you don't feel that west is not a financial burden right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| that maybe you couldn't concentrate on your other facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| West is a financial burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| North and south are both doing financially considerably better than they were last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| I was before the commission, considerably better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| Our estimation is that we can survive this period of private pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| so that we can get back into serving Medicaid residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| How many people are still in residence that have to be moved out of west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| Thirteen on last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| I don't know today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| That was my note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| I just want to make sure I had it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| You were talking about 60 miles radius or whatever to relocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| yet you told me a minute ago that in north you were at 84% capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| and in south you were at 94% capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| Why don't you just move those people in your existing facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| If I wasn't clear, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| North has historically been at 84%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| We moved 40 west residents to north, and the percentage today is much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| It's, of course, never 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| But you don't have 13 beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Jim tells me it's 97%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| How many beds do you have available right now at both facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| 95 at south and 271 at north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| I mean empty beds right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| You said you're at 93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| That leaves you, what, nine beds in one facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| And surely you've got four beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Jim says nine at north and two or three at south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Pretty close to 13 in my math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| I hope I didn't give the impression that we couldn't place those 13 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| Between now and the 8th, we have every intention of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| And if they could be at north or south, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| But I cannot tell you for sure that the best move for the resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| or the family is to move from west to north or to south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| That depends on the resident and the family and other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| The math works out, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| No more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| Yes, I need to speak to Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| How many nursing homes does Grace have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| I believe they have 44 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| What are the ratings on these nursing homes they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| Beg your pardon, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| You don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Could you speak a little closer to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| I would like to see how they're rated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| I think that we need to see that you're doing a good job somewhere else, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:51| I'm beginning to get the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| I feel like when I hear this for pay and I read in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| it may be west was doomed to fail because it would be for pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| Are you planning on taking on more for pay people down there than you've normally had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| Let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| I am not a Grace employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| I am a Hillcrest employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| You are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| I am a Hillcrest employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| Well, Hillcrest voted to come up here and asked us to take Grace in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| and I thought maybe you probably weren't there at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| You know, but we've done everything for Hillcrest to know we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| They came up here and getting this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| They said they'd hire a new director at west, which they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| He didn't work, so they've got another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| But the main thing I'm concerned about, I feel like we really misled the Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| And I don't know whether these commissioners remembered or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| but when I bought out all these thoughts on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| they were standing down there at that podium and talking about it's because the floor is unlevel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| or this addition was put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Go back and check the minutes on it if you think it's because the floor was unlevel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| when all the time it was saying that there were special focus facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| the government saying these people were in immediate jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| If you could get it, Bill, you or Mr. Murphy, either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| I want to see Grace's record in their 24 nursing homes how good they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| And I'd like that by the time you come back for this next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| Jim Murphy, 1120 North Union Grove Road, Friendsville, 37737.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:33| Mr. Murphy, does Grace operate Grace Healthcare of Clarksville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| I am not familiar with all of the facilities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| Does that have just one star out of five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| I think that's so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Does Grace operate Grace Healthcare of Cordova?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| Again, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| One star out of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Does Grace operate Grace Healthcare of White's Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| Again, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| One star out of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Grace Nursing Center in Memphis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| I want to take that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| That's two stars out of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Grace Healthcare of Franklin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Three stars out of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| In other words, the best one of those listed in Tennessee is average, if I'm right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| and those aren't Grace owned by other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| I believe that's where Grace is out of is Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| So, I mean, the answer to Paul's question is right there in the government records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| that the trust has not been earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| They don't aspire to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| They don't aspire to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| Substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| Read that again, Tyler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| The motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Do you want substitute motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| To give ourselves 30 days deferral to craft a resolution starting the 90-day clock for withdrawing the county contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5091)|
| 1:25:03| Four calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| Four calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| That starts from the next meeting we have if they haven't done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| Yeah, at the next meeting we would have a resolution that would start the 90-day clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| and that would give us the time to consult the way to write that resolution, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| I think a good thing for them to do, show they're making some headway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| would be to go out there and start working on north and getting it at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| Everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5133)|

| 1:25:37| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5137)|

| 1:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| Any hill, water, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| Not that I'm aware of, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| Not a big hill overlooking an ocean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| No, sir, it's proposed for Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| We didn't identify a slope protection area or a stream protection area, so it's a good site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:42| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Back on 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| That was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| What's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:23| Amendment to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| 010 to 101, consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5367)|
| 1:29:35| It's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| It's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| It's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:50| 906, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:58| MPC, to consider amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance as recommended by the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| related to the composition of the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| This is just so that we have one seat per district and that the person who sits in that seat resides in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:28| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| You know, I think we're at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| We're doing it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| We're passing resolutions where there's already ways to get things on the books and get things approved or disapproved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| I'm living witness, perfect example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| Last month I brought someone's name up that wasn't in my district, and you all chose to vote that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| We moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| That accomplished that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| We're trying to pass laws on top of laws, resolutions on top of ordinances to do something that we have the power to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:11| There's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| There's an appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| There's a vote, and that's how we should take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| I think this is overkill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| You all can ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| We can ask the question of every appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Hey, do you live in the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| If the answer is no, you have a right at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| So, again, I think this is just, you know, piling on what's piling on isn't necessarily prudent or necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5493)|
| 1:31:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Mr. McKenzie, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| And, you know, another thing that this does, and I'm co-sponsoring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| is it also establishes that the BCA will be a citizen board and that while this commission will make those appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5519)|
| 1:32:08| you know, appointing someone from the district, that they will, you know, that they won't appoint themselves to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:16| I know state law has been changed and commissioners can serve on the BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| And I really think we need to go one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| And that's why I'm sponsoring this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| And I have no, it's not going to hurt my feelings if it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| But I think that what we need to do is we need to firmly establish that the BCA is a citizen board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| or we let it go back to being a commission board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| And I don't care which, but I think we need to establish that it's one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| And one of the reasons why I support it being a person that lives in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| if it is a citizen board, is that, you know, air supporters can put all kinds of pressure on us to appoint certain folks to BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:08| And what I'm afraid of is that a lot of the folks that fund commission campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| and support commission campaigns tend to live in the fourth and fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| I know most of my donors live in the fourth and fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| And what I'm afraid will happen is if we turn it loose to where we're going to appoint citizens that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| that we're going to wind up with pressure that, again, I can stand up to pressure pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| I have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| We're going to wind up with pressure to appoint folks that air supporters may want to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| So I think we need to go one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| We need to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| And if we don't pass this, I think we need to just let the commission sit as the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| You know, we're going down to one commissioner per district, and that would be a pretty easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| But I just think we need to do one or the other, and I'm open to suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| Sam, I don't think what we did a while ago applies to something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| What we're doing, if they're not in the district, these people are disenfranchised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| They don't have anyone representing them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| And that's, you know, one vote, one man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| I think that's contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| I think everybody in Knox County needs proper representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| And if it's not, if they don't have, like, if the fourth district has two, they've got an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| The first district can become a dumping ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| And especially if we go down on commission, it may even put less people on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| I don't know what the rules are going to be on the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| We may still have nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| But I just feel like every district needs representation on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| And being chair there, I know how it's very easy if it's loaded with some district having more votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| they can shove everything that's no good in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| And that's just the way I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Commissioner Broyles, you have nine BZA districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| Is that how you're doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| But technically we're going to have 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| So technically you have districts 10 and 11 are the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| So I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| I mean, are you just wanting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| You'll have nine, quote, what we think of as districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| Then you have your two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| But they're listed as districts 10 and districts 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| So I don't know if there's a distinction between that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| Are we sure that we're going to have districts 10 and districts 11 represented on BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| Because those are basically the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Well, I guess getting back to what Commissioner Lambert was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| if it ends up being the commission serves, the entire commission serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| then I guess if you want to have all of them, then you've got to have 11 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| I'm in favor of citizens serving on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| So am I, but I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Regardless, Greg, you're still just going to have nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| If you have two at large, you've still just got nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| That's not county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| I mean, city council only has so many districts and two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Yeah, district 10 and district 11, I believe, are at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Referred to as at large, not as districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Yeah, but they are listed as districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| They're not listed as seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| They're listed as district 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| They should be listed as at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| Would it not disenfranchise those two guys if they don't get to appoint two to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| Brad, do you want to have a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Do they get a chance to appoint someone from your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Do you want to have a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| I would, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, respectfully, the BZA, as I mentioned earlier, is a creature of statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| If you're a charter form of government by Tennessee code, that board will consist of five, seven, or nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5815)|
| 1:37:03| So the max we can go to is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| The maximum is nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| That would be an appropriate number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Beyond that, I think you'd be outside the confines of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| So for future reference, if you wanted to make it a commission board, then you'd be excluding two of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| Right, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| I think it needs to be citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| I think that citizens need more opportunities to participate in their government, not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| I think commissioners have enough to do, especially when it's going to drop down to one per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| My point about this, and I'll try to make it brief, is that this is not piling on and piling on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| In my opinion, this is streamlining and making our government more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| But we went through last time with whether or not tyranny mates could represent the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| We wouldn't even have to deal with that if this had been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| I'm trying to make things a little bit more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| You just want to be nine citizens, one per districts one through nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Commissioner Lutho, may I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| It would be nine districts because what Ms. Brewer's intention is, is to have every district properly represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| without one having more than one person in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| And if you put 10 and 11 in there, one district could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| Just for clarification, if she'll just say districts one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| It can only be nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| And I apologize for being a little bit short-tempered tonight, fellas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| Does the maker of the motion agree that it should be just districts one through nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| Just districts one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| Well, from what our Deputy Law Director said, nine is the maximum number we can have on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| I really wish folks listened to what our Deputy Law Director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| What he said was that districts have nothing to do with BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| That's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| He said that it can be five, seven, or nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| We're the one imposing this one district, one vote edict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| There's nothing in the state statute that talks about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| So you guys are having an argument that is not germane or pertinent to appointing BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:19| I understand that people feel pressure because they're going to get all of the developer buddies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| to call them to stack the board up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| That's a personal, interpersonal kind of conversation you need to have with yourself and those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:34| But the BZA is not a one-per-district organization entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| It was never meant to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| It was never meant to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| If you listened to what Mr. Jarrett said, it gave numbers, recommendations on numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| Okay, it didn't say, oh, well, no, it's got to be 11 because we had a vote that said 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| so we've got to change it to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Nope, nope, we're going to cut that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| It didn't say any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| It didn't say any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| So we can vote how we want to vote, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| But this whole notion that there has to be, that somehow we're violating a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| and we don't have one-per-district is, again, it's not a conversation that we should be having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| Unless we want to say we want one-per-district, we want to go against the statute, we can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:25| But we're up here having a conversation about districts one through nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| and there's nothing in there that forces us to do that, that suggests that we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| Having sat on the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| I recognize it has been historically the pattern that each district have one member of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6052)|
| 1:41:02| At one point in time, that was one commissioner from each district, which was nine members then of that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:12| I believe that when I inadvertently asked the question about how the first district was finding its candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:20| I was just going on the assumption, which maybe I shouldn't have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| but the historic precedent has been that BZA was composed of nine individuals, one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:37| And to stop and pause right there for just a second, I believe that's probably how we should be in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| how we should continue to be made up of in Knox County for the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| One citizen representative from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| And the reason I say citizen representative is because the fear that County Commission can set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| as the Board of Zoning Appeals is out the window by what the law director just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| It can have a maximum number under state law of nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| If County Commission is 19, it can't sit as the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| If County Commission is 11, it can't sit as the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| So, I think we're okay on the number, and the only place that can come from is citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| and historically the citizens have been one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| I mean, let me back up and say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| The County Commissioner is a citizen, so it has always been composed of one citizen per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| And as long as we stay that way, however we want to word it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| as long as there's one citizen per each district, we've got nine districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| then the Board of Zoning Appeals is okay and the question that we've got before us is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| I agree with the arguments that have been placed here about citizen board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| I think that's absolutely helpful to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| And what we had, what started the argument with Commissioner McKenzie in his choice of Tierney Bates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| and Tierney Bates being from the fourth district, he was, you know, he's just an outstanding person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| an outstanding candidate and would have served BZA well, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:37| And so it gets down to that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| We just want the best people that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| And so what are we using to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Are we going to use structure or are we going to use the recommendations of the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| And, you know, it does get down to people in the end, no matter what structure we place on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:57| And I tend to now think that this structure, you know, it's simple, it's clear, it's easy in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6237)|
| 1:44:07| And it's a structure, but it still gets down to the choice of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| And that will depend a lot on the integrity of the commissioners involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| So I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| And we can still screw it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| I just want to respond to some of what Mr. McKenzie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| We are not going against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| State law says it can be so many members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| Well, we decided it's going to be nine members in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| Now what we're doing is further making our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| It doesn't violate the law to say that the law tells us we can do it, that these criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:52| that we have to meet these criterias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| This body comes along and says, yes, we're going to meet these criterias| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| and we're going to add these other criteria for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| And I don't think that's a violation of state law at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| I think we're taking what they've given us and we're enhancing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| And that's why, like I said, I mean, I would be just as happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| which state law has been amended now, to allow commissioners to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| I would be just as happy to let county commissioners serve on BZA again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| You know, I mean, I don't care as long as it's nine people from the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| And I think that what this does is we are certifying that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| we want nine people from nine separate commission districts to serve so that we get diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:42| so that we have people from different parts of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| people from different backgrounds coming together on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| And then I think we further clarify that and say, oh, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| we don't want these to be Knox County commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| It would be completely legal for them to be Knox County commissioners at this present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| But we're stating there that in the future we want this set up of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| And I support either way, as long as it's nine people from individual districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| And I didn't know your nominee from the last appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| They were probably very well qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| It just, just as a matter of principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| I want to see these appointments be divided up amongst the districts so that we don't wind up with the fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| and fifth district having, you know, more of their citizens on these boards than anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6393)|
| 1:46:41| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| Believe it or not, I'm turning my light off because of the eloquence of Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| I got the right amount of caffeine and sugar in my system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6411)|
| 1:47:01| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6435)|

| 1:47:20| 16 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| to review the sales contract for the property located at State and Clinch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| and to discuss the proposed sale of said property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| No recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| I don't know whether you read my post or not on the commission form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| I'm just going to hit a few highlights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| I think I've come up with something here that most everybody can agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| You know, my initial concerns stem from the fact that in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| Knox County approved a sales agreement with the Devon Group in the amount of $796,500 for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:13| with the understanding that the developer had plans to build a $52 million mixed-use residential retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| and office space project on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| And this property was appraised for $915,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| They were looking for an eight-and-a-half point million TIF on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| They stand to change if it sells for the million four to make $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| Although this resolution targets the property located at State and Clinch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| in reviewing the agreement and sales contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| and after discussing the item during Tuesday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| I realize my concerns are not merely with this particular sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| but more specifically with the TIF and RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| Knox County often utilizes to sell property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| I believe, as in the above scenario, the effect the current process have on the county purse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| and ultimately on the county taxpayer is appalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| I would like to make the motion to make these changes in the TIF and RFP policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| First, the terms of an RFP and subsequent sales agreement should not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| If any portion of the RFP or the subsequent agreement should change, a new RFP will be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| Now, we changed this after it was bid on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| We gutted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| No restriction in it whatsoever that we put out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| So I think if it's changed, it should go back out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| Secondly, the deadline for submitting the proposal should be extended to allow all interested parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| to submit their best bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| That gives people that don't know about it time to try to get financing and things round up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| Now, I talked to Hugh, and Hugh said normally it was 60 days that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:58| That's correct, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| Hugh Holt, Deputy Director of Finance, 1000 North Central, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6599)|
| 1:50:06| I asked about extending this another 30 days, making it 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| I think that I'm going to make that a motion that those two things right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| And then finally, I would like to say a TIF should not be offered as an incentive to purchase property for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| But I'd like to make it a motion that those first and second be approved to where we can't change an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:29| Because people will bid on these things, and if we can change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| they're really not fulfilling their part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| We're not requiring them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| And that does not affect any service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| I'm just talking about real property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Well, and it is not our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| It is our practice to allow 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| It can be longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| Typically in our policy is 21 business days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| which roughly is a month to allow somebody to put a bid together and to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| Like Paul said, our practice is on real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| It's usually more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| It's 60 days or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| If you guys would like to codify that into, you know, 90, 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| But just remember this, that in some circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| those properties the county may need to dispose of those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| and having to go through six months of a process and then 30 days at school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| and 30 days at commission may land them six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| nine months down the road before they ever see any funds from the sale of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| Well, the school property, I believe we passed a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| all that should be auctioned at public auction and go back to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| It is to go back to the school system, but it's not all by public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| It's up to the county commission how we dispose of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:58| We're only extending it 30 more days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| and I think that would give the county a fair chance to get more money for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| if more people were interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| And it's not, like I said, it's not formally codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| That's our practice, not our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| So if you'd like me to do that, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| Just understand that when you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| you've locked yourself into anywhere from maybe six months to a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| before you can dispose of a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| depending on how long you go through an evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| And there are a lot of factors involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| Well, Hugh, why would extending it 30 days extend it out six more months or a year longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| when we're just extending it 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| No, I'm just saying that that's our practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| It's not our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| There is nothing in policy right now, other than 21 business days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| which is about 30 calendar days on the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| And that doesn't give many people long time to get their financing or anything straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| And on the new Sentinel site, we advertised that bid approximately 60 days at RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| We advertised in seven different publications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| We spent over $2,000, 14 different ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| I also called in Furrow Auction Company, who is our contracted auctioneering service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| had them to review the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| Their recommendation was RFP, which subsequently commission approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:22| And the result is the sale to the Devon Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:30| But the RFP we put out, it ended up wasn't anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| And I'll tell you how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Typically when we have a public auction, the auctioneer provides a sales contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| That contract, once the sale is completed, is forwarded to the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| where they use that agreement to create a quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| And we sell all of our property by quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| I'll defer to Joe Jarrett if he would like to speak otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| But typically that's quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| You correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| The RFP that we put out on the Sentinel property down there, these people bid on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| and we delivered them the deed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| There wasn't a thing in that RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| And that was my next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| It was completely wiped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| With RFPs and sealed bids, what we have is the bid itself that comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| There is no sales contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| That information is then forwarded to the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| where a sales contract is developed and then a subsequent deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| All I'm saying is if we put an RFP out and someone bids on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| that sales agreement should not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| If it changes, it should go back out for another RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| And I want to be clear too, Commissioner Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| that no one from the finance department or from the purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| changed the terms or conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| That information was forwarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| And then subsequently we received the information back in purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| and the commission voted on to remove Exhibit A, which was the developer requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| I never have found Exhibit A yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| Have you found it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| No, sir, but it was in the commission minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| I know, but I've never found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| That's what it says, Exhibit A, and nobody knows what Exhibit A is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| It was exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| I never saw it with the covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| You know, we don't have anything to do with the covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| This protects the taxpayer if it's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| I mean, I'd like to come up here and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| I'll give you this piece of property and do this, this, and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| And you say, okay, and then after you sell it to me, I say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| I don't want to do this and take it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| And that's what we've gotten into on the Sentinel property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| And you'll have to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| And I will say that I didn't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| I didn't mean you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| I'm not leading you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| I'm not leading anybody that anybody done anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| But what I'm saying is when you make an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| and there's such a large change in it, it should go back out for bid again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| Commissioner Pinkston, reading your posting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| you're issuing a resolution asking first that the terms RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| and subsequent sales agreement should not change an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| or they say it has to be reissued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| At the end you say something about a TIF that should not be offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| Well, the reason why I said that, I didn't put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| That can't be in your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| You didn't hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| I said the first two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| But I just said that last one we shouldn't use it because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| use that to entice people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| That's just, I mean, I didn't say that's in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| The first two there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| And RFP, if it's changed, has to go back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| And the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| You're submitting proposal be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| I mean, what are you asking it be extended to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| 30 days, 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Hugh said it's already 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| By practice it's 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| He says that's not stated in concrete either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| It's just an administrative policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| Yeah, it's practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| It's not policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Yeah, to allow additional days for the sale of real property under RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| One thing to keep in mind here, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| that might ease some people's minds is those TIFs do not go with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| Once it's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| What about, so this doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| It has nothing to do with TIFs either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| This doesn't affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| It has nothing to do with TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| It has nothing to do with TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| I got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| Mr. Holt, this doesn't affect any auctions, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| This is just RFP process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| This is RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| And the commission gets to decide how we sell it, either by public auction, RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| sealed bid, negotiated sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| It's up to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| All I'm saying is, Commissioner Anders, if we put an RFP out, it shouldn't be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| If it's changed, it should go back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| First of all, Paul, I haven't heard a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| But could you, this to me sounds more like an ordinance than a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7073)|
| 1:58:03| because you're dealing with procurement policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| You're correct, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| I was at the end of this, I was going to let you guys know, if this is a change you want to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| it's going to have to go through two readings because you're changing the procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| It's got to be done as an ordinance, not as a resolution, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| And instead of voting on this tonight, could you maybe bring that back next month so that we have a chance to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:28| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| I can articulate an ordinance for you if I have a moment with you, Commissioner Pinkston, this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| I'd be happy to work with you guys as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| All I'm trying to do is protect the taxpayers and get them the top dollar for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| And this is making everything fair, the playing field is level for every developer out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| Commissioner Pinkston, you want to withdraw and then bring it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Yeah, I've got a bunch of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| Cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| We'll get you before I leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7147)|

| 2:00:45| Is there anyone for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Mr. Chairman, at the beginning of commission I asked for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| We have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| Is it my turn yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| A resolution regarding downsizing commission regarding the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| I would like to rephrase that to say a resolution of the commission of Knox County asking that the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| and attorneys representing Knox County in action called Charles Drew et al. v. Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| and the number on that is 176120-1 in Chancery Court, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7283)|
| 2:01:31| to refrain from any conduct which might result in a delay of that court making final determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7291)|
| 2:01:39| of the loyalty of the claims made by the plaintiff taken in that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| And more specifically, let me give one, well, let me refresh everyone's memory first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:53| It's about charter changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| It's about diminishing representation of certain districts in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7315)|
| 2:02:03| It's about prohibiting county employees from aspiring to certain elected office in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:11| It also regards the reduction of the size of Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| and maybe it changes one word in the charter regarding the word nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7335)|
| 2:02:25| In other words, what I'm asking for is that commission here be of one mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:34| and ask the law director to direct whoever is working on commission's behalf in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:46| that every effort should be made to achieve an expeditious resolution of that litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| to protect the integrity of upcoming electoral process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| I'm not asking the judge to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| I'm asking on both sides of this issue, I'm asking that the action be moved as quick as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:11| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| Just to clarify, I have a question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| David, are you involved in the lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| Most certainly am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| Would it be okay with you if I made the motion rather than yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| Because that way nobody can come back and say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| And let me back up for just a second and claim an area of conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| I am a party of both sides of this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| I'm a member of Knox County Commission, represent the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| and on the 8th District's behalf, I am pursuing the fact that the 8th District was not of the mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:53| that county commission should be reduced from 19 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| That's the entire cause of my action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| The thing I'm introducing today, which I will happily allow you to introduce, would be that we ask that Knox County move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:14| I ask the question of the law director today, the elected law director today, if this is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:23| since all information is currently or the majority, the most of the information is on the judge's bench,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:33| that the judge do whatever he would like to do with this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| I believe it would be in best interest of my both interests that that be allowed to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7478)|
| 2:04:47| So if the name on this resolution is not mine, that's quite all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:56| I just want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| You want to rescind your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| I rescind my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| Withdraw it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| And I'd like to make the motion and set myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| Go ahead and make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| I make the motion that we approve this as a resolution, and I'd like to go down as the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:18| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| I appreciate Dave Wright's unusual position of being in a place where he's almost suing himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7530)|
| 2:05:39| I appreciate the difficulty of understanding the complexities of these lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| But at some point, I have to wonder if this is a resolution that has come too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| The filing deadline has already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| So any expeditious action by the court could create havoc that is reminiscent of what happened four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7554)|
| 2:06:03| I keep thinking to myself, isn't this where I came in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| And I worry that some outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| Now, an expeditious outcome that says that what we've done is fine and the elections can go forward as planned would be a fine expeditious outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7572)|
| 2:06:20| But an expeditious outcome that says one or more of these lawsuits has merit could send our electoral process into similar chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7580)|
| 2:06:29| So I'm not sure what merit we have because, quite frankly, courts go at their own speed anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| And our nudging them, I'm not sure, will have much effect at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| And those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| I don't know what our efforts will do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| We know judges do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| But I applaud Commissioner Wright for this sense of urgency bringing it to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| I follow this case very closely also, as I'm sure we all have, and attended some of the trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| And I think there was a, as we know, it's a legal tactic to sort of stall and come up with this for that reason to delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| and request that can't be back in a week, let's make it three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| We saw some of that at the December 18th hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| Then, unfortunately, nature hit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| I think the hearing was delayed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| The middle of January with a snowstorm caused it to be delayed two or three more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| But there is, I think, I spoke with Mr. Frith and McKay out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| I believe the ballots have to be printed 40 days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| So that would be roughly March the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| So that's about two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| So we're not, we hadn't crossed the Rubicon yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| We're almost there, but we're not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| I think until they print the ballots and they're mailed to Afghanistan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| I think there's still some room for a judge to make a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| And, obviously, I guess he can make a decision up until after May the 5th, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| I don't know how chaotic that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| Very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| But, nevertheless, thanks for doing this, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| And I just, I agree that this thing's got to be resolved as quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| hopefully as quickly as possible for resolution one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| Commissioner Bufo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| Regardless of what we do or would like to see done, this lawsuit is going to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| And if we can do anything to expedite this decision, I think we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7705)|
| 2:08:37| We had an attorney representing us that was appointed by the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| that did everything within his legal mind to try to delay this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| I mean, that was his tactic, which in a lot of cases is a very good tactic for an attorney to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:56| But in this case, Knox County needs an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| Knox County needs to know before we're probably put in a bigger chaotic mess than the term limits, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7740)|
| 2:09:09| that if we have to somehow go from 11 back to 19, I think would be more chaotic than what happened a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7749)|
| 2:09:21| And anything that we can do to try to help get this resolved one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7761)|
| 2:09:29| we need to try to do and get that message across to our attorney, not to the judge, but to our attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7769)|
| 2:09:35| to let the case be heard and let it be heard as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7775)|
| 2:09:45| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| One passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| Maybe in that lawsuit you should have struck out the term limit thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| I kind of want to stay now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| We're having so much fun, aren't we, Tate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| We're having a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| Get the people to vote for me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| Let you all just come here and run things and do all this and not get paid, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| Other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| There's no one else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| Public forum, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Is there anybody from public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| Dwight wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| Mr. Chairman, if I could, and, boy, if there was ever a time to be briefed, this is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| Name and address of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| Dwight Van DeVate, 400 Main Avenue, Suite 615.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| You've got five minutes for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| That's about four too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| We just did not want to leave commission with the impression that we are unconcerned about the position that Mr. Mays places this body in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:48| or the accusations that he makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| We do take them very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| But we have not found that coming down here to debate him from the podium is a useful exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:59| I am accountable, as is Tom Salter, as is Bruce Weitkirk, as is Mike Ragsdale, for every word that passes our lips at this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7859)|
| 2:11:06| So we will take these things under advisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| We will respond to them in writing, as has been our practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| If you have questions about my letter of February 16th that spoke to the Oak Ridge matter, I'll be glad to field those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:20| But I don't think anything useful is contributed by me coming down and engaging in an on-the-floor debate with Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:28| It takes long meetings and makes them longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| We'll be glad to speak to any and all of these issues at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| and certainly will respond to the things that were said tonight in writing rather than some sort of debate from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7895)|
| 2:11:42| The only other thought I would share with you about this is, emphatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| we do not look back on the events of the past few years and blame John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| John Evans was a passionate environmentalist and a good man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| And it is all too easy for somebody like Mr. Mays to sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| and armchair quarterback decisions that were made ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| John's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| It's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| He knows better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7926)|
| 2:12:07| And I would ask that he stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| And I hope that if he continues to come down to this podium and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| that somebody else will perhaps step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| And actually, Commissioner Royals, thank you, because I took your words to heart tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| because it would be too easy for me to come down here and be a little too pointed in my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| So I'll work hard not to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| Dwight, I was kind of wondering, when do you think you're going to get an answer, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7952)|
| 2:12:39| from the whole Oak Ridge, that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| How long do you think this process is going to take to kind of do your fact finding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| We've gotten a pretty good start on it already, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| But when you're looking at records that are ten or 11 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| it's not that easy to reconstruct what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| And certainly when the author of these records is deceased, it makes it that much harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| Very briefly, we think John made what he thought was the best public policy decision he could make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7984)|
| 2:13:10| The commission that would have been in place in 1999-2000 made a decision to operate a green waste facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7990)|
| 2:13:19| I will tell you that the green waste facility at Solway is the only one of its kind in the state of Tennessee that we know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=7999)|
| 2:13:26| It is the only freestanding municipally operated green waste facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| It is operating under permit number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| What appears to be the case is that when John went out to market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| and did an RFP for contractors to operate the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| they needed certain minimum tonnages of incoming material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| We don't have brush and leaf pickup in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| and there was no way for us to guarantee those tonnages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| so vendors were not interested in doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| It appears to us that John arrived at this agreement as a way to guarantee adequate tonnage of incoming material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| so that he could get a vendor on site to operate that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:09| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Sort of on a lighter note, no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Sit down, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| Last commission meeting in the parking lot, my vehicle was uncooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8060)|
| 2:14:29| Commissioner Leuthold gathered me up and carried me home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| past the detention facility halfway to Marston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:41| So if anyone has vehicle difficulties tonight or next month or for any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| until somebody's got vehicle difficulties, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| So you're talking about the folks that don't shop at Advantage Auto Sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:59| I'll call Dave Wright when you have vehicle trouble in the commission meeting trying to get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| It's my turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| Thank you, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| You're more than welcome, and you didn't have to mention it, but I do appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| and the only thing I ask of you is to pass it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| I thought I heard you asked him to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| Craig did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| We have one more item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| We're not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| We have one more item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| Report and discussion regarding stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8129)|
| 2:15:35| Do you have something, Mr. Moss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| You want to talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| You go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| I was basically going to refer to the Graysburg issue that's at hand, and we're not responding to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8142)|
| 2:15:50| So, as a matter of fact, Laura Cole had requested that Knox County come out and look at her property again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:59| even without the rain, even though there's no damage being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| and even though there's no stormwater problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| and even though nothing is really happening to harm her in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| According to the testimony from that podium, we currently have erosion on her property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:15| and other property that can be seen during dry weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| And she asked that the stormwater group come, and they responded that they would come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8179)|
| 2:16:25| and we're still looking for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| And the real issue is not whether there's harm or not harm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| but when a citizen contacts Knox County and asks for us to respond, and we say we're going to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8191)|
| 2:16:37| I think at minimum we ought to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| And that's about what I've got to say about that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| So, Commissioner Norman, if you have anything to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| I just wish that when our citizens call, whether we like the issue or don't like the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| and we say as a community we're going to be there, as a government we're going to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| I think we have an obligation to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| I think that Ms. Cole sent me an e-mail that said that Steve Elliott was the person who had said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:07| that he was going to show and investigate that erosion issue that she had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| So, I definitely will call Mr. Granger and ask about that and see if they did, in fact, do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8232)|
| 2:17:20| If something happened, she didn't know or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| The only other thing that I had to report was that the Stormwater Ordinance Review Committee is continuing to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:30| and it's the second Wednesday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| The next meeting is March 10th, 130 at the Stormwater office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:39| And last month we had TDAC come and report on how TDAC and Knox County Stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8259)|
| 2:17:49| how they function together in regulating our water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| What comes from the meetings, a lot of the gist of the meeting is that our standards are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8274)|
| 2:18:01| So, that's what the commission needs to realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| Our standards are getting more stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| They're based on federal guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| They're going to get tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| It's going to get tougher for us to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| And so, just be forewarned about that, that it has ramifications for us from a physical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| And then I hope you all, there's several of you that have come and have also expressed interest in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8301)|
| 2:18:29| But we'll continue next month with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| Mr. Chairman, just to mention real quick, the parking committee is starting their meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| and it's getting pretty contentious at the parking committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| And Lincoln Day dinner is this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| Mr. Paul Pinks is our guest speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| Who do I get tickets from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part2?start=8333)|
