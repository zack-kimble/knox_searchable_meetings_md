| 0:09:20| We were so glad to hear all of the discussion among the members of city council at the first reading of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=560)|

| 0:10:21| Building on the previous ordinance, this is another common sense measure to make our streets safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| The current city code restricts engineering from lowering speed limits on city roadways below 25 miles per hour except for in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| and eliminating this restriction would provide engineering with the power and flexibility to set a street's speed limit to what needs to be for that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=631)|
| 0:10:40| not just adhering to some general minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| This step also aligns well with the goals of reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| and we are happy to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=648)|

| 0:10:58| I have a question for Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| There's a resident in my district who had some concerns about the number of roads that would be impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| I believe your team has done some analysis as to how many roads this will impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| Can you share some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=675)|

| 0:11:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Maybe try the middle mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=683)|

| 0:11:29| Come to the podium or speak loud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Probably the podium is best, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| For the TV audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| I'm afraid I'm shorter than her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| With respect to numbers on our previous ordinance, I believe we just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| They're all related to posted or unposted speeding, so humor me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Whatever you need to know, because I have a fun sheet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| There's 4,062 speed limit signs throughout the city of Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| The ordinance that you just approved, we have been systematically eliminating those unless otherwise posted signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=717)|
| 0:12:05| There's only 43 of those left within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| With respect to what this ordinance may allow us to do, I can think of specific park areas in your district, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| where folks have been concerned about the speeds there, that this will allow us to get that back on a gravel road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| which allows us to get that back to a reasonable speed and protect the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| Our intent, assuming you're all's passage of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| is we've been working with TPO to identify the key vehicle, pedestrian, bike conflicts through the town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=754)|
| 0:12:43| whether it's been injuries or even deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| And our first focus will be going to those locations, going through an analysis to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| is the speed posted too high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| If that is the case, we will drop the speeds in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| The second thing we will do is, as I mentioned earlier, this is a tool in our toolbox related to traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| We have a number of neighborhoods where we're seeing more walking taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| more families out on the roads that we've yet been able to put sidewalks in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| although we're chipping away at that very diligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| If appropriate, based on use or even the geometry of the road, we will evaluate those and bring those speeds down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you. Speeding is the number one thing we hear from all neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Thanks for going back in time and amending an ordinance with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Thank you, Council Member Smith. Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=817)|

| 0:14:12| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Hi, my name is Mitchell Connell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| I live at 829 Farragut Avenue in Oakwood Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| I run a non-profit bike shop in town called Two Bikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| and I'd like to talk about a couple of ways that scooters kind of pertain to what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| So we provide affordable bicycles to the community, half the bikes that we have donated to our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| We sell back to the community as a form of affordable transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| The average price of a bike at our shop is $256,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| which is a lot cheaper than what you'll find at most other bike shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| And the other half of bikes that we refurbish, we give away to the community to local non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| like Big Brother, Big Sister, Boys and Girls Club, or Centro Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| One thing that pertains to scooters I think is pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Since a lot of people don't have access to vehicles, we have people that want to come buy a bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| but we're located in a historic old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Sometimes that can be difficult without a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| We've had multiple people arrive at our store on scooters and leave on bikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| which I think is great. I think it's really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Also, I'm currently in the process of developing a youth workforce development program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| and I've been in communication with a representative from Link Scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| to offer youth that are going into our program free passes for scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| that would increase access for youth to be able to travel to our program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| to get job training at the bike shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| So those are just two examples, I think, how scooters help the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| And yeah, I think that they're great, and I'm here to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| So thank you so much for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| Next person signed up to speak to this is Scott Schimmel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| Mr. Schimmel, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=947)|
| 0:15:59| You can just start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Scott Schimmel, 933 Luttrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Yes, I am also in support of the scooters for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| Personally, I think they're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| I've used them many, many times to move throughout downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| My wife and I have a business downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| and so we go from one side of the city to the other fairly regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| and also we live close enough that we can take the scooter from our house to work and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| It's not only convenient, but it's also a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| And I understand, I mean, being downtown on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| they can be a nuisance sometimes if they're parked incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| but I think there's been a lot of work to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| and I'm happy to see that there's been a lot of work to make sure that they are being parked correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| and being ridden correctly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| I think that's another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| You can't really blame the scooter itself for being driven incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| but I think some of that enforcement with people understanding not to ride on the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| and riding them properly, a lot of work has gone into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| and so I look forward to being able to ride a scooter around downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Next person signed up to speak to this is Chris Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1041)|
| 0:17:31| Chris Cherry, 1305 Beacon Hill Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| Spoke to you two weeks ago about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Certainly I still support, obviously, the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| I believe that the city has done their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| or really taken a careful approach to scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| I think that they're one way that people can take kind of a human-scale mode of transportation around downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| We've been kind of building out pedestrian infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| and kind of hoping if we build it they will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| I think scooters are one way that they've come in a way that I never anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| I don't think anybody anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| but I think it's an important kind of compatible component with that vision that Knoxville has embarked on a decade or more ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1090)|
| 0:18:21| Again, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| The research shows there's all the safety issues and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| that they're not more dangerous than anything else that's really on our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| They're more visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| There's a lot more kind of media sensation about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| but at the end of the day, they're another mode of low-speed sustainable transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| Everybody's got an anecdote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| So I actually rode a scooter for the first time in months this weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| because I was visiting some, had some friends in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| and we were wandering around downtown from the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| State Street Garage is where I parked down to World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| and I left something at World's Fair Park only to realize it when I was back to the old city, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| And so what did I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| I could get an Uber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| I could go back to State Street where I parked for free and drive my car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| or I could get one of these scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| And I got on the scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| I had a free pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Because I'd taken a safety training with the company a couple of weeks earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| and so they gave me a free pass for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| So I said, I'm going to use my credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| I'm going to go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I'm going to pick up my thing, and in ten minutes I was there and back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| and I was able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| The only downside is that I wasn't able to travel on some of the roads to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| that I would have been able to drive on with any of my cars, the Uber or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| So I was kind of blocked to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| but I think that for me it's just a perfect example of how scooters provide a service free to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| that you don't have to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| that provides mobility around downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| and connects some of these kind of hard-to-reach places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| a little too far to walk or walk much, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| So for those reasons, I mean, that's just one anecdote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| There's a lot of stories like that I think that we don't really see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| and we don't really hear a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| and I think that it's important that that kind of mobility is provided for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Council, two other people signed up to speak in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| but your rules state three, four, and then three again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| So if you want, Ms. Scott is from Bike Walk Knoxville is here if you guys have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| And the other person signed up as an alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| So unless there's objection, I'll go ahead and start the discussion on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Ms. Fugate, I saw your light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| So we don't have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| I would like to make a motion to amend the ordinance that we have before us, and let's vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1248)|
| 0:20:58| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I think you have to make a motion on the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I'll make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| If somebody seconds it, then you call right back on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| So when we talked about this two weeks ago, one of the things I heard a lot of concern about was the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| And there was a lot of consternation about administrative rules and stuff that would allow these on greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| And the sense I got was that folks weren't necessarily feeling comfortable with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| and that's what I heard from constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| So I have a motion to amend the ordinance so as to delete the portion of the ordinance which would amend Chapter 20 of the city code relating to greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1295)|
| 0:21:49| and leaving all other portions of the proposed ordinance intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| That doesn't mean you can't change it later, but that's what I want us to talk about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| A motion to amend the original motion to delete the greenway portion, as she just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Is there a second on the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Motion to amend is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Is there any question or discussion on the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| I see a lot of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Are these questions about the amendment or the underlying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| So no questions on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Yes, there is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| I have a question for Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Currently, as I understand it, e-bikes are allowed on greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Is this working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| No, we got it to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Good job, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Carter Hall, Policy and Business Innovation Manager for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Yes, Class 1 and Class 2 e-bikes are currently allowed on greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| And I believe there's a state law that limits the speed with which those can go on a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| 20 miles per hour, definitionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| And so for these scooters, what would be the speed with which they can ride on a greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| If we were to expand them into the greenways at any point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| understanding that there's a motion to omit changes to Ordinance 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| if down the line that were to change and we were to expand usage into the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| the city cap would default to 20 miles per hour as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| However, after talking in our internal scooter working group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| we feel very comfortable making greenways a reduced speed zone to 15 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| So that's something that we would certainly look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Again, default, it would be 20 miles per hour, making them a reduced speed zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| So e-bikes are allowed now 20 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| I think you feel comfortable, the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| or the working committee feels comfortable limiting scooters to 15 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| If we remove Chapter 20 of this and we changed our mind a year from now and thought, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| it's all right for the scooters to return to the greenway, what do we have to do then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| I guess that may be a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| We just propose an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| We need council members to propose a new ordinance that would change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| I'm sorry, but, I mean, you know, five votes will get you anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| So it's up to council to make ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| And if we don't like this, we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| So my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Sorry, did you have something coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| My last question is how would this restrict access to certain parts of town that you can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1463)|
| 0:24:34| like to use a greenway in the current map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Well, we currently have greenways that are on the operating area programmatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| are already set up as no-ride zones for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| So effectively by removing Ordinance 20, you would not see changes to the current program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| My last, last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| How would this restrict us from expanding the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| If we were to expand into greenways into the future with the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| then we would look at, again, before that would happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| we would look at amending Ordinance 20 to make sure that regulations were in place for PMVs on greenways going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1509)|
| 0:25:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| So it would restrict us unless we changed, reinstituted Chapter 20 in certain areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1518)|
| 0:25:27| Understanding that motorized vehicles are not allowed on greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| it is, they could be restricted in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Councilmembers, with your lights on, do you have questions or discussion about the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I'm not seeing any nods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| I'm in support of this elimination of the greenway section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| That gave me a lot of concern in the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| and I spent a lot of time talking with community members about scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| and there was a lot of concern out there with regard to use on the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| So I'll definitely be supporting this motion to amend to remove that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| Mr. Hall, what I wanted to ask you, though, is, so currently there's no use of scooters on the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1581)|
| 0:26:32| Our greenway ordinance in Section 20 does not specifically allow for electric vehicles to be ridden on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1592)|
| 0:26:41| That would be the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| We have a card about specifically for electric bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Well, the electric scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| For the electric scooters, the state law would state that they would be considered –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| the state law does have a card about electric scooters are not considered motorized vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| However, we would have under the ordinance they would not be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| And so in order to make a change based on this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| council will have to act to make a new ordinance in order to bring scooters into the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Okay. That's why I just wanted to make sure that was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| And then with removing this section regarding the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| is there any other areas where it would also be affected other than just greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| Or is it just greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| It is just greenways at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Council Member Rodgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I had my light on for a different reason, but in discussion I have a thought that pertains to the greenways component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| which is what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Mr. Hall, what are the current limits on the numbers of devices during the pilot period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| During the pilot period, each vendor has a limit of 250 devices, so a total of 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| Okay. So this ordinance that we're voting on is 300 devices each for two vendors or for three vendors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1688)|
| 0:28:18| Two vendors to go from 500 to 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| And what it just dawned on me, we did not discuss this when we had some robust conversation this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| So if we eliminate the greenways part, the rationale behind going from 500 to 600,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| is that it was going to spread those other 100 out beyond the city center and North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1713)|
| 0:28:42| I think those are predominant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Are they allowed right now in South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| They are allowed down Sevier Avenue, not super deep into the neighborhoods back there, but down Sevier Avenue and into the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| So with this amendment, how are you feeling about, how should we all feel about the 500 to 600 change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| The 500 to 600 change is to account for variations in the fleet so that can be deployed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| understanding that there are possibly bigger footprinted devices that could be brought on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| specifically the seated scooters, in order to account for that bigger footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| We have a ratio system set up to where the bigger footprint devices cut into that cap at a quicker rate than a regular standing scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1756)|
| 0:29:25| So it accounts to be able to hold those devices in the in-street parking zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| while also being able to have our vendors serve markets outside of downtown and Fort Sanders, not be limited by a fleet cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| Okay, but if we're eliminating the Greenways component, we're cutting out West Knoxville because there's no other way for them to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| We currently don't allow operations in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| It does not go past Mason Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| I understand, but I thought part of the, when we originally discussed this two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| the reason for the number going up was that the new footprint anticipated was going to include the Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| I'm not arguing for the Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| I'm questioning the number because we're now not going to be able to include West Knoxville in this expanded footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| There's just no way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Council Member Ryder, I think this is for the basic back to the main motion, not to the Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| We can come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Is there any question about the motion on the amendment about Greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Council Member Parker and then Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| My concern is if we are seeing this, I think we need to figure out, are we seeing this as a form of entertainment or transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1839)|
| 0:30:49| And same thing with the Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Are they just entertainment for an evening stroll or do they get us from place to place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| If we're seeing that as an alternative to getting from place to place, then to encourage that whole alternative transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1855)|
| 0:31:05| I think we need to have scooters on the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| I am in support of changing the ordinance to a lower speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| A few questions came up during that discussion, but one was trying to get a little more clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| Could you speak a little closer into your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Yeah, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Part of it was trying to get a little bit more clarification on Council Member Smith's question about where they're currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1891)|
| 0:31:41| And outside of what they're allowed by ordinance, is there geofencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| Our microphones are sort of messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Okay, we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| That currently prevents, because we've certainly been sent photos of scooters in Greenways currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| So is the geofencing, is it supposed to prevent it currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| We instituted, I think about six or seven months ago, more robust no-ride zone geofencing along our Greenways that are in the operating area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1926)|
| 0:32:17| So any sort of issues, I have not been made aware of any issues since we've done that on the Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1937)|
| 0:32:25| That was to totally prevent them from being in there in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| Current operating area does include sections of, I think, First Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1950)|
| 0:32:39| But again, that's a no-riding area that's controlled by GPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| It is at least programmatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| They are not allowed on the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| And again, the personal mobility vehicles, electric personal mobility vehicles, to go back to the first part of your question, could be allowed on a Greenway currently under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1967)|
| 0:33:02| However, the current ordinance that we are proposing, Ordinance 20, would curtail that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| But again, it's understanding if we want to limit devices on Greenways at this time, striking Ordinance 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| and with administrative changes that we've made to the administrative rules since previous discussion, limiting their use on Greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=1998)|
| 0:33:27| until Ordinance 20 changes that came back that explicitly had a carve-out for personal mobility vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| that is what would make it very clear that they would be allowed on Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| As if there was a clear carve-out, similar to electric bicycles, that they are explicitly allowed on Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2018)|
| 0:33:49| I'll just say that I just want to echo what my colleagues are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I really think that if these are to be used as transportation alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| and we've been investing in green spaces as an alternative route for individuals to navigate their way through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2039)|
| 0:34:08| we have to think about our intentions behind this ordinance and allowing the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2048)|
| 0:34:19| And I think it's really smart that questions that have been asked about other non-motorized vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| or even electric bicycles that are currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| We have received concerns and complaints, but we still have to think about the long-term goals of this new alternative transportation mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2068)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you, Ms. Parker. Ms. Gill, did you have something to clarify or add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| I only wanted to clarify that I think our intention here is that we respect that Council's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| around this particular element of the ordinance has been particularly challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| and so we would support pulling it out of what you're voting on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| But to the points that were made around the importance of thinking around mobility corridors in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| we also want to have that discussion, and as we alluded to when we met previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| we would anticipate needing to bring that to the Greenways Commission very specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| And so, again, in alignment with that intention around engaging our partners and stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| we would still want to do that, but I think what we're hearing from you all in the previous meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| was that it made sense to partition that discussion, bring that back to you at a later date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| such that you all could consider that on its own merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| in alignment with some of those broader issues around mobility and corridors of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| But, again, that that could be a separate discussion that is separate from the allowance of the shared scooter program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| which really is designed to connect areas using our street infrastructure rather than our Greenway infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| because we do not allow them on Greenway currently. That is not an issue for us at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Ms. Gill. Other people, are your lights on to talk about the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| Yes, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to, I appreciate the sentiments that we've heard about the concern for Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| I ride my bike on Greenway. I actually rode an e-bike for the first time around the neighborhood this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| and I got up to 20 miles an hour. Those are on Greenways now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| and so I appreciate the concern behind this proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| I just can't support it, because logically I just think that we already have things going faster than these on the Greenways now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2191)|
| 0:36:39| and we can throttle these down, pun intended, to 10 miles an hour, I think, if we so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| So I think they don't cause any more harm than a bicycle, which can go up to 15 miles an hour on a Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2206)|
| 0:36:55| and it will cut off access for future expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| and I just don't think it needs to be evaluated on its own merit any different than the rest of these components of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2220)|
| 0:37:11| So I think it makes sense as part of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| and I would rather see us reduce the speed on Greenways as opposed to treat it as it's a weird and scary thing, which it kind of is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| But I think, factually speaking, we've learned that it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| but I realize the newness to our community with these has caused some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| So I think we should reduce the speed on Greenways, not restrict mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| By the way, the folks that probably use these on Greenways are not tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| So to your comment, I think, a minute ago related to whether these are for entertainment or transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| I think the answer is it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I think if you go down Gage Street, you might get one answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| If you go down the Third Greenway or William Skelton or the Neyland Greenway, I think you might get a different answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2273)|
| 0:38:03| So I can't support the amendment because it doesn't reason with my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| More discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Miss Testament, not on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| The reason I offered this, I hear what you're saying, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| I think for me, since they haven't been allowed on Greenways at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| and people are already struggling some with increasing the number of scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| and rather than do another moratorium, rather than kick this can down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| I'm trying to offer something in response to what I hear is a brand new thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| I've had many conversations with Deputy Mayor Gill about the desire for the Greenways Commission to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| and I struggle with supporting the whole ordinance when I hear so much concern about the greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2335)|
| 0:39:04| because I do think our community struggles with, are they for transportation or are they for recreation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| And I think it will take some time for folks to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| and a few e-bikes is not the same as hundreds of scooters on Greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| and that's why I made the motion to try to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| I don't disagree with you that at some point we may have to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| I just, in light of our last discussion, I offered this up to my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| We'll see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you, Ms. Fugate. Any other questions on the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| I'll just piggyback on what my colleague just said, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| So I think the issue with the greenways has come in from probably two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| One is infrastructure, and so I'm not sure that the greenways have the infrastructure currently everywhere that you want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2395)|
| 0:40:04| potentially on one of these scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| It's not necessarily all level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| It's not necessarily all without angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| You'd have to maneuver and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| And I think when you're speaking of these scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| you're talking about something that somebody is renting as opposed to something that they own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| So I think if you own a bike, you're more likely to know how to use that bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| as opposed to if you were just renting something and trying something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| And so certainly we want to be cautious of safety of all the people that are using the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| all folks that are using any means of transportation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| But I think especially in the greenways, that issue of infrastructure and the users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| and their experience in using that I think is a big point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| So I just wanted to piggyback on why I'm supporting this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Council Member Hesterman and then Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| That did bring up a question for me on the greenway piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| What is—I mean, I know we've talked a little bit about privately-owned scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| and if someone should invest and as these modes of vehicle become more potentially cost-effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| what is preventing, and again, the enforcement of privately-owned scooters being rented on the greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| Ms. Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| And then Carter could speak to this as well, but I think, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| until there's a definition change to Ordinance 20, it would be interpreted as hauling as a motorized vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| and therefore would technically be restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| To your point, I think it would be very difficult to enforce that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| because our biggest tool that we have on the shared scooters are the geofences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| that are baked into the technology, which obviously is not anything that a private scooter would be constrained by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| So, again, realistically speaking, it would be hard for us to enforce that clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| but until Ordinance 20 is changed, they would continue to be restricted as a motorized vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| based on our interpretation of the existing city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Mr. Testerman, are you done with the questions on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| On first reading, my hesitancy in supporting this motion did have to do with the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| I support the motion to make the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| My current concern mainly was the fact that the Greenway Commission hasn't really had a chance to discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| and that's kind of the body that's being charged with public input on the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| So I felt a bit like we were getting the cart before the horse some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| and so I would feel much more comfortable as making a definitive ruling on whether or not they're allowed on the greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| after we had this conversation among the Greenway Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| and so at this time I would be in favor of the motion not allowing greenway use at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2577)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you, and by the way, I know you served on the Greenways Commission for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| so I know you know they do great work, so I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| Ms. Ryder, is this about the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| Yeah, I'm just going to say I kind of agree with some of the comments that Councilman Smith made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| Sorry, my brain went blank for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| You know, there's plenty of biking that happens at 25 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| It used to be my regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| I know you're looking at me funny, Councilman Smith, but we can get you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| A little training, a little motorbasing, not on a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| But, you know, there's some greenways, like there's a new greenway along following I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| There's a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| There's just some ways that that's the only way you can move into some of the neighborhood areas in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| and some of those places are far more appropriate for this than sidewalks where people are walking in and out of stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2636)|
| 0:44:06| and some of my biggest issues that I have discussed with Mr. Hall is people running red lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| So I think some of the tight infrastructure downtown is where there's far more problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| and far more enforcement issues than the greenway, so that was not my hesitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| So I think I'm going to be not supporting the amended motion, and whether it passes or fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| obviously we have discussed this extensively, and there's plenty of room for discussion in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| But, you know, the numbers are very clearly codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| They're not part of the administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| They're part of the ordinance, and they're based upon expanding the footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and including areas that are reached by greenways outside the reach because of things like Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2686)|
| 0:44:55| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| I promise I don't have a scooter sticker on my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| I don't own one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| I've ridden them once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Not very good at them, but I do think Councilwoman Testerman's comment made me think of if you own your own bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2705)|
| 0:45:16| if you own your own scooter, you can do certain things, but if you can't afford those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| you're not going to be able to access greenways, although against the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| So I appreciate also I want to plug two bikes and how easy they're trying to make it for everybody to own a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| But until then, people can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| So people can't get on certain greenways, and I just think we should amend this to reduce the speed, not the whole concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2735)|
| 0:45:45| So my last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| The motion to amend is what we're voting on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| Does everyone understand what they're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| All those in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| We got to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| You'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| And Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| The motion to amend passes 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Now the motion, the original motion is back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| It's now been amended to remove greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| And again, as we discussed, as you all discussed, that can be brought back in the future after we hear from Greenways Commission and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2793)|
| 0:46:43| So now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| And I would suggest, Mr. Smith, did you, Mr. Testerman, I mean, Mr., I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| It's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| I was just going to propose that we hear this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| This is the second vote on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| I think in a healthy way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| And I think we should hear it on emergency because I believe the pilot ends at the end of the year and we don't want to run up against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| So I want to make a motion to hear this on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| The amendment on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| There's been a motion to hear this on emergency since there has been a substantial change and it would avoid the need to hear a third reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| It's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Does everyone understand this motion to hear it on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| Any questions or discussion on the motion to hear it on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2856)|
| 0:47:44| You're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Well, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| I wish the order were different and we could discuss the ordinance before the emergency measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2870)|
| 0:48:05| We still have a chance to discuss it after it's heard on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| I have a few concerns with the ordinance that after discussion could warrant additional amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2891)|
| 0:48:24| And that's the only reason why the order of things was off for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| Mr. Frost, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| The emergency hearing just makes it a one vote decision as opposed to a two reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| You could do more substantial amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| We can still discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| So even if more amendments are adopted, if it's heard on emergency, it's heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| That means it would still be on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| So any other questions on the motion to hear this on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| I just want to ask the law director if just because I think some folks probably watching at home or in the audience might not understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2934)|
| 0:49:03| So has there been a substantial change if we remove the greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| Yes, that is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| So in making a substantial change, then council would have to hear this not only tonight, but one additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| If it passes after an amendment making a substantial change, that would move it back to ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| And that was the that's what Councilmember Smith was making a motion for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| So I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| So now we're back to the vote on hearing this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| Are there any other questions or discussion on that particular motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| We're going to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| This is our first and second reading of the substantial change thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| So now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| Councilmember Parker and then Councilmember Test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| Question about some definitions in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Division one of the ordinance where it discusses the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| Section seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Section 16, 7, 1, 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| It sets the permit fee at 12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| But then later, there's a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| For.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And I wanted to ask if those were two separate requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Councilmember, they are two separate requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| If a vendor is selected for the first time, they're selected to be issued an operating permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| They have to pay both the $12,000 and the $5,000 bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| However, if they are re-selected two years later, if they're able to renew their permit, they do have to pay the $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| They do not have to pay the $5,000 bond again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Is the $5,000 amount somewhere included in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| I believe it is set in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Ordinance 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| I'm looking at section 16, 7, 3, 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| And I didn't see an amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| And the reason for my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| And I emailed you a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| But there's emphasis on the writer understanding the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| And the ordinance also states that the operator will be responsible for educating users on how to use the scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3107)|
| 0:51:59| And I appreciate you sent me a photo with some visuals of what one of the operators does currently to educate users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3119)|
| 0:52:09| But my concern is still with what is focused on the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| And not how to operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| And so I think I might have run a red light when I wrote it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| Look, don't look so shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| I did the best I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| But it was because I didn't know how to write it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| I was one of those folks trying to get from one side of Gay Street to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| And then found myself committing to getting on this electric vehicle not knowing how to operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| And having the legal right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| But, you know, I feel like if we really want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| You know, if we want to hold folks accountable for their actions, what we have in place is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| We want to ensure that the operator takes responsibility for truly educating the community so that they're more likely to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3173)|
| 0:53:03| When they use it, they're more likely to use it appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| We see more examples of proper use around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| I think we've got to put more emphasis on educating users on how to use them in order to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3191)|
| 0:53:22| The reason I asked about the bond required is because, you know, it states that if there's any damage to public property, the city would use the bond money to pay for such damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3202)|
| 0:53:36| And so my concern is if there are a large number of inappropriate uses that lead to property damage in excess of 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3216)|
| 0:53:51| Is there a way for us to hold the operator liable for that damage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| I would let Deputy Mayor Gill expand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| But my understanding is, yes, we do have additional means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Risk management has laid that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Ms. Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Yes, and I see Charles Watson also nodding with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| But, again, there's a bond element to similar to how we do with most of our contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| There's an element of construction contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| There's an element of a bond that provides a minimum stop gap that makes it very easy for us to get that damage recouped to the extent that there would be additional damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3257)|
| 0:54:28| And, again, our ordinance as well as our permit will make clear that they are still responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| And I think Charles can speak to what it would look like to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| The bond element just makes it easy and simple to enforce those rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| But we still have all the actions of law that we might otherwise have if we are damaged and if they are in violation of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3280)|
| 0:54:48| So we could pursue them legally if it got beyond that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| My other concerns remain the lack of infrastructure going into place for the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| I think that that has to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| Once expansion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| So those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| As I've said before, I mean, I see scooters as a benefit and as a value to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3321)|
| 0:55:33| But I really am trying to find ways to create buy-in, more ways to create buy-in from the public just based on the complaints and the observations that many of us have had, that I've had, that a lot of people have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3333)|
| 0:55:53| You know, so I go to the numbers and I look at, you know, 400,000 rides with the highest usage in downtown of Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3353)|
| 0:56:03| And now we're expanding the fleets to, you know, to cap at 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| And I realize we're incorporating e-bikes and the lower ride scooters as well, but not that many comparatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3370)|
| 0:56:19| We're establishing the corrals, which I'm a big advocate of, 15 to roll out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| So that's 150 if there are 10 vehicles per corral that are on these deployment sites, which leaves 450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3386)|
| 0:56:37| So I go back. We're expanding the footprint roughly five times based on the heat map of where rides end to an expanded area of just glancing roughly five times the area of where access would be allowed for these scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3397)|
| 0:56:56| So then we've got roughly a potential of 450 scooters outside the footprint of downtown with no corral system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3416)|
| 0:57:05| And I go back to the littering of scooters, and it's highly concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| And I've gone back to, you know, St. Petersburg, as you've heard, is kind of my role model for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| And they have, you know, they have, you know, you continue to be charged if you don't end in a corral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| The companies, if there's a nuisance scooter, they have 30 minutes to go pick it up, or the company is fined in addition to the rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3448)|
| 0:57:39| They keep them to bike lanes or streets that are 30 miles an hour or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| You know, the education campaigns as well, you know, they offer income qualified discounts for people riding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3464)|
| 0:57:56| So I guess where I'm going is I feel like we're starting out, you know, it's about setting expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3476)|
| 0:58:05| And we're starting out with a great deal of flexibility, which quite frankly in the pilot has led to a lot of problems and a lot of controversy and opposition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3485)|
| 0:58:23| versus starting out with a better infrastructure and boundaries of rules where we can always lessen them as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3503)|
| 0:58:33| But I just don't feel like the enforcement, I mean, I would have liked to have seen an MOU or a draft contract with PBA if they're going to be the primary source for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3513)|
| 0:58:44| But there's a lot of, you know, coulds and ifs and mays and shoulds versus, you know, we're going to try and cut down on, you know, the littering of scooters versus we're going to really try and eliminate the littering of scooters on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3524)|
| 0:59:02| So I guess, you know, you kind of answered one of my questions on the education piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| And thank you, Mr. Hall, for your time and talking to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| But really, you know, St. Petersburg has 90 corrals and probably a very similar square footage and we're rolling out with 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3553)|
| 0:59:25| So I'm concerned about the potential of 450 scooters outside the footprint of downtown and Fort Sanders where the highest ridership is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3565)|
| 0:59:34| And what is, you know, what does that look like and what's the enforcement and how does that change from what we've already experienced with scooters being all over the place and not really reeled in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3574)|
| 0:59:49| So I'm trying to understand the rollout that are on the corral system, why we can't just periodically, you know, as we're able to establish more corrals, then add more to the fleet within kind of that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3589)|
| 1:00:06| Mr. Hall, could you speak to corrals? Why 15, not more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| The reason why we started with 15 corrals was understanding the cost of installation for each of those corrals and trying to be able to install as many initially as possible and understanding that the payment for the corrals would be made up for by the operating permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3612)|
| 1:00:28| By instituting more corrals initially as the number, so let's say we were to start out with 40 corrals, that number, if we're trying to make it back from the operating permit, makes the operating permit frankly probably too cost prohibitive for most vendors to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3628)|
| 1:00:44| And if we truly want a competitive bid process to get the best vendors and get a wide variety of vendors, we didn't want to make our market too cost prohibitive to enter for most if not all vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3644)|
| 1:00:57| Now as we are able to continue to add in operating permit dollars into the account that those fund into in the engineering fund, we can certainly look and will look at expanding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3657)|
| 1:01:12| I would anticipate the number of corrals once we work with engineering, Mark Elliott specifically, who we've been working with, to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3672)|
| 1:01:20| However, 15 was again selected to make it both affordable for the city and not cost prohibitive as it is kicked over essentially to vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3680)|
| 1:01:30| At the end of the day, vendors through the operating permits are the ones funding infrastructure expansion, and the initial cost just market-wise prohibited about 15 corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3690)|
| 1:01:43| However, that infrastructure, like I said, becomes more cost effective as time goes on and as adding them is spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3703)|
| 1:01:53| To the question of how devices will be deployed outside of downtown and in Fort Sanders, while yes, vendors could deploy 225 devices themselves in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3713)|
| 1:02:08| it would be done so in a way that would help to serve market demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| They're not going to put scooters somewhere where they're not going to be used and sit there to be cluttered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| I know that Cheyenne Woodyard actually with Super Pedestrian who does the link scooters is here and I'm sure can talk about that as well as community education programs and any other questions that you all might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3738)|
| 1:02:29| I'm sure she would be happy to talk about how they choose to deploy scooters in certain areas of town and how they would go about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| However, we think that 15 corrals will significantly reduce the amount of clutter on the sidewalks downtown where again there's much higher foot traffic than in the commercial corridors where we are trying to push scooters to serve those areas better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3758)|
| 1:02:55| So the way that the foot traffic interplays with the sidewalks, we think that the infrastructure currently would serve the amount of scooters that would be deployed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3775)|
| 1:03:04| But we would look at increasing the amount of corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| Also within the administrative rules we have the ability at any point to expand the in-street operating area so it could be the case where we would expand on to say north central or down Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3787)|
| 1:03:19| But that would be a conversation with impacted neighborhoods, with impacted businesses, and of course like engineering, KPD, folks like that who would look at traffic for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3799)|
| 1:03:28| But going back to the corrals, because this is obviously I feel like is one way for both safety, but they have to be deployed from there but they don't have to end a ride in a corral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3808)|
| 1:03:43| They can end it on a doorstep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| The way that the administrative rules are currently written, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Riders are able to end their rides outside of the corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| The reason why we did that is understanding that we believe that scooters and all personal mobility devices do serve a benefit to the city, namely mobility, and trying to maximize that while also cutting down on the nuisances and on the pain points of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3833)|
| 1:04:11| We think that the corral system will significantly cut down on those pain points, but we don't need to sacrifice maximizing mobility by allowing a rider the flexibility to end a ride on a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3851)|
| 1:04:24| And again, that scooter is going to be picked up at the end of every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| Understanding that ridership is at its most significant the closer you get to the end of the operating day, which is again at 11 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| I think maximum ridership tops out at 9 p.m. most nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| So a scooter is only going to be ended most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| It's going to be there for a handful of hours before vendors will be required to pick up a scooter and redeploy it in a corral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3883)|
| 1:04:52| So we think that this will significantly cut down on pain points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| It could certainly still be the case where a scooter will be on a sidewalk downtown or in Port Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| Of course, it has to be parked within NACDO standards in order to be within ordinance and within the rules and to avoid a citation to either or both the vendor and the rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3901)|
| 1:05:12| But we do think that this will cut down that pain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| With it being administrative rules, it's at any time we do not see that riders are or if we still see that if we don't see a decrease in any sort of concerns over organization or if we do not see organization improve like we believe it will, then we could switch it and require riders to end rides and corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3916)|
| 1:05:39| I would certainly encourage you all to let me know if you have constituents still complaining about scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| However, again, we do get reports through folks like 301 and we communicate with the vendors on where those are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3944)|
| 1:05:53| Is there, should this pass tonight, is there any kind of safety net for council to revisit this just based on the concerns that, you know, the unknowns that I don't, I don't see, but I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3953)|
| 1:06:14| Council obviously can bring things back to the agenda as Council wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| So, moving on to Miss Fugitt and then Miss Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| So, again, Councilwoman Festerman, we don't just have to act on things that the administration brings us, we can make our own ordinances if we want to revisit something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3985)|
| 1:06:37| My question is along the lines of I've been asked questions of if and when there's a traffic incident, like if a scooter runs a red light and causes a traffic accident, who's liable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=3997)|
| 1:06:53| I mean, who's going to get the ticket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| I've had that asked of me and I didn't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| And I said, I'll ask tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| City Law Director, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| I'm talking about if, no, I'm talking about if the scooter runs a red light and causes someone who, and gets hit because they ran a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4027)|
| 1:07:19| Like if my car runs a red light and somebody hits me, I'm still responsible because I ran the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| This person wants to know because they're scared to death driving down the road with scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| If somebody did that, would the scooter person be responsible and the scooter company's insurance have to deal with their car issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4052)|
| 1:07:42| I assume that's the case. I'd like to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| If the scooter operator fails to abide by the rules of the road, the law with regard to operation on the highways, the scooter operator will be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4065)|
| 1:07:56| The scooter operator will get the ticket from the police department if they run a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| There will be penalties involved outside of that to the company itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| But the scooter operator, if they don't follow the law, they will be responsible for their own violation of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| With regard to who's liable in the civil suit, I'm not getting into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| Okay, okay. Yeah, that's always a point to us. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| So that was one question I had about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| So those are some of the questions that I keep getting about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| And I don't know if anybody can answer this, but it goes to Councilwoman Testerman's question about how many scooters are going to be out there and when they have to be picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4111)|
| 1:08:42| So the other night when I saw seven scooters by the sidewalk at the Coliseum parking garage, because that's where somebody ended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4122)|
| 1:08:53| I'm sure they were parked in the Coliseum garage, rode the scooter down there, got in their car to go wherever they go, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| There's no place for them to, they just lay them down or lie them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| My mother, the English teacher, would be very upset that I didn't quite know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| So will they have to be picked up by midnight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| Or are they okay to be, if there's no corrals anywhere, what happens to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| They have to be, in that case, they would have to, if it is not in compliance with NACTO standards, it would have to be, the difference being restaged and rebalanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4163)|
| 1:09:35| Rebalanced means it's basically set up correctly within the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| If it's out of guidelines, it would have to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| If it was within guidelines out of the industry parking zone that has the corrals, then, again, as long as it's within NACTO guidelines, it would not have to be retouched by an operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4182)|
| 1:09:54| I'm trying to understand if being on the grass out of a corral is within guidelines or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| So if at night they're in the grass downtown and there are no corrals around, they would have to be stood up and properly positioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4203)|
| 1:10:13| I'm sorry, I think I misunderstood your initial situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| If they are downtown, then they would have to be picked up and re-put in a corral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| Outside of downtown, outside of the industry parking zone, it would have to be put back into proper standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| But if it is downtown, it would have to be picked up and put back in a corral between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| If too many are downtown at the end of the day, they have to redistribute them out through whoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| So if $12,000 is about all we can permit the people would pay, how few scooters do we think we could deploy that would still be attractive to have people want us as a market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4239)|
| 1:10:55| Is there any research on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| Because I think that's another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| If you don't have the corrals for them and we're just going to extend some of this visual clutter other places, is there any idea how few somebody would be willing to come for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4260)|
| 1:11:13| I do not have that market research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| I know that we have face demand problems in the past, especially when we had COVID cleaning protocols in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| It significantly cut down the amount of usable scooters at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| And we did face market demand issues where there were more people looking for scooters to ride than there were available scooters that were online because, again, we were requiring them to shut off before they could get cleaned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4287)|
| 1:11:38| So we have face market issues before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| I don't think something like 50 scooters would be able to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| I'm talking about if we don't, if Council doesn't want 600 scooters and we say we want 500 scooters, that's all we're willing to do this ordinance for, do you think we would have vendors come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4306)|
| 1:11:57| And that's a hypothetical, but I hear that kind of concern from going from 500 to 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| I do not necessarily know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| Thank you, Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Yeah, I just think it's important to state a couple of things for the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| Number one, I appreciate, Mr. Hall, all the work that you've done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| I know it's been a lot of work, and I feel like you can quote some of the stuff in your sleep probably by now because we've drilled you a lot by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4339)|
| 1:12:28| For the public, I think it's important to state, you know, we've gotten feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| We've gotten support, comments and e-mails, and we've gotten, you know, folks saying vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| I think it's important to cite that if we vote no on this, which we passed it on first reading, that we're just getting rid of rules and regulations that give it guardrails and parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4360)|
| 1:12:52| Correct, Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Because the pilot expires, and then it's a free-for-all unless we, you know, suddenly, yeah, because we're out of the pilot thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| So I just, I think it needs to be really clear that voting no doesn't really get us anywhere ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| It gets us kind of backwards because this is what we've got, and this is what, you know, the pilot has given us a lot of rules and parameters to guide things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4388)|
| 1:13:16| And I think we've addressed some of the concerns and feedback that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| So I just wanted to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| I personally, and Mr. Hall knows this very well, I'm not a fan of these things because I think everybody needs to have a helmet, and we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| But I do appreciate, as was brought up last time, that that will be in the RFP ways to encourage it and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| One of the biggest concerns that we've addressed and danced around is people not following traffic laws, running red lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| and you and I had a very robust conversation about how seriously those reports would be taken and examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4423)|
| 1:13:52| And so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| I also want to say to the rest of council, obviously we can come back and revisit this any time we want to bring it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| but also Audit Committee could do a really in-depth dive and look at the pilot data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| We could look at it in the future after a year of when the RFPs go in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| There's a lot of opportunity for us to deep dive if we really, really, really want to examine all the data and complaint with Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4453)|
| 1:14:22| I'm not sure he wants to discuss this more in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| I would be more than happy to, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder, Councilmember Parker, and then Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| One thing I wanted to bring up in response to Councilmember Testerman's question, and Mr. Frost, I'm going to ask you for your help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4472)|
| 1:14:43| I learned something this year that I think could be relevant for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| But potentially, if you vote against the measure, then you're actually not able to bring an issue back up for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4487)|
| 1:15:06| If you vote for a measure, you can bring it back to Council for reconsideration and a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| Can you help me with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Loosely speaking, Councilmember Parker, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| I mean, for example, if you did an appointment, if you appointed Mr. Johnson to some committee and voted in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4519)|
| 1:15:28| I'll really bring that up again to take him off the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| There are some circumstances where, you know, like that, where a motion to reconsider doesn't really apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4533)|
| 1:15:42| But there are some circumstances where it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| I just can't think of an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| Maybe Mr. Johnson can think of a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Mr. Frost, I think Ms. Parker is sort of asking if someone were to vote no on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| could they bring it back up again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Or if they vote yes, could they bring it back up again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| You can bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| If there's a revision you wanted to do at a later date, I guess you could bring up a revised ordinance for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4566)|
| 1:16:17| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Yeah, it's only if you're talking about exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| It would be a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| And a motion to reconsider must be made by someone who is among the prevailing vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| But that would not prevent anything from coming back up that is in any way different than what was previously considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| You can bring a new measure up anytime you want to as a council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| So if we want to bring a new revised ordinance back to council, we can't vote against this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| You have to be in the prevailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| You said prevailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| Oh, non-prevailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| You can adopt this ordinance, and then you can come back in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| You can't come back in two weeks because we'll be on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| But you can come back in four weeks and offer a brand-new ordinance that would be different than this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| And if council voted for it, they voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| Sooner or later, they're going to get tired of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| If you think this ordinance is bad, and then four months down the road, you think, oh, you see, I knew this ordinance was bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4632)|
| 1:17:20| And, you know, I feel like we need to repeal that ordinance and maybe even send it to committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| Send it to a workshop to discuss developing a new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| You have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Then you introduce an ordinance to repeal, ordinance number whatever this turns out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| I've got one clarification I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| This kind of general comment that I wanted to make about the implementation plan and our thoughts moving forward regarding the scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4667)|
| 1:17:59| If we have, you know, scooters deployed all around the city, but then we are sending a fleet of diesel-fueled trucks around the city to straighten them every 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4679)|
| 1:18:16| This is not our energy-efficient travel alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| And so we just need to think about, you know, for me, the infrastructure, the corrals are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| I do not want, you know, chaos to be spread throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| I really think we need to require instructional videos on how to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4714)|
| 1:18:42| But I am in support of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| But we need to be intentional about how we deploy them and make sure that they're not just for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| And we truly are reducing carbon emissions as we deploy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| We're not, you know, creating more with all these trucks running around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Is there a vendor here that we can speak with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| Yes, there is Cheyenne Woodyard with Super Pedestrian, again, who operates the Link Scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| Ms. Woodyard, do you have a question for her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| If you could come up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| And Ms. Singh has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| My name is Cheyenne Woodyard, and I'm here on behalf of Super Pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| We operate in Knoxville as Link Scooters, and the address is 84 Hamilton Street, Cambridge, Mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4772)|
| 1:19:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Good to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Good to see you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| So my question is, it feels like the city is doing a lot of work on the behalf of the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| I'm wondering about, you know, we've had to, I believe, I'll ask this question after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4788)|
| 1:19:56| but we've had to augment our contract with PBA so that they can do some of the citation work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| I am wondering, I would like to see the scooters end up in a corral so that nobody else needs to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4803)|
| 1:20:11| It's kind of, you know, help yourself and put it back where you're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| What is the return on this market that Link is making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4815)|
| 1:20:23| I don't have financial figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| It would take me some time to, like, find that answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| I'm trying to figure out if it would be cost prohibitive to make that requirement, to add that to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| So I cover policy for the entire United States East Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| I only have one market that requires operators and riders to start and end rides in corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4844)|
| 1:20:52| It might be a little bit of a smaller market than Knoxville is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| The footprint is definitely smaller, and they have installed more corrals than what the initial plan is to enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4859)|
| 1:21:10| But they're also a pilot program, so their rules are expected to change in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| I mean, what I see pilot programs are for is to find out is this working or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| And what we found wasn't working is that scooters were laying around everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| So I'm thinking about that I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| And I think Councilwoman Parker brought up a really good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| This is about sustainability and transportation and having diesel trucks do the work of putting them back where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4895)|
| 1:21:43| So I am ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| So there are several ways in which we're able to rebalance vehicles that does not always require someone in a van picking them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4905)|
| 1:21:55| Sometimes if it's a rebalance that just requires someone to move a scooter that has a significant amount of charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| they're able to just do that, like, on foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| And then we have another group that may go around collecting where the van comes in places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| like if a scooter needs to be repaired or if it is a low critical battery that needs to be taken back to our service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4931)|
| 1:22:19| So every scooter that is touched is not necessarily touched by someone who was in a van driving it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4939)|
| 1:22:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| I think some of my next questions are for Mr. Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| It doesn't sound like it would be cost prohibitive to have them end up in a corral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| It's a comment I'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| And another, I would also ‑‑ I have some questions about whose responsibility is what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| What will KPD have to do if an accident occurs or the citations that are going to be sent to the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4969)|
| 1:23:01| Is it PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| What does KPD do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| What does the company do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| Happy to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| And to your first comment, the cost prohibitiveness is just on the amount of corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| The reason why we're not making rides end in a corral, again, is a mobility policy decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| but one that could be altered based on administrative rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| To answer the question on enforcement on what will happen, so starting at kind of the highest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| your riskiest, most reckless behavior, if somebody were to be operating a scooter or any PMV in a way that was reckless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5008)|
| 1:23:37| endangerment, running a red light is certainly an example, wrong side of the road, swerving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| then ‑‑ or any other thing that, again, would be harmful to the individual, others around them, or property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5023)|
| 1:23:52| KPD has expressed that that's something that they would take very seriously in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| flipping on the blue lights, going to that person and saying, you know, we need to end this ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| They would be able to cite them under Ordinance 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| KPD has also said that in situations where it would not be disruptive or dangerous to go and correct a rider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5046)|
| 1:24:16| misusing a scooter and when they would be able to appropriately give a fine under Ordinance 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5056)|
| 1:24:24| they would do that as well for misuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| However, Sergeant Coward, who is in our main scooter working group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| has expressed that it's just not feasible a lot of the time to safely be able for them to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| and if they see someone less recklessly misusing a scooter to go flip on lights, stop traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| and turn around and go after a rider, that's not always feasible for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| So we've tried to develop multiple different layers to be able to get at misuse and especially misparking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| also understanding that we likely don't want to dedicate KPD time to going and chasing around misparked scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| So the multiple layers for that, again, KPD would certainly be in charge of any sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| and I will say any sort of accident that may occur, the proper emergency vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| whether that's EMS fire would be called to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| For the lower down levels of misuse, so say like misparking or if somebody is misriding a scooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| while we have seen significant cut downs on the amount of people riding devices on sidewalks, that is not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| So if that were to happen in a way that we're not considering reckless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| and KPD did not consider it safe to go after that person, KPD, PVA, through what we've discussed with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| through an additional tack on, it's not in conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| It doesn't sound like we would do that through an additional contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| It would be built into our current traffic citation contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| So it's, again, not its own separate contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| And basically what that would be is when PVA officers are going and doing their rounds as they normally would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| to check meters and general traffic violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| they would also have built into that being on the lookout for a misparked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| or if they see someone misriding a scooter, they would have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| or they would understand how to properly record that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| There isn't a definite way of how this system would work yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| It would be developed very quickly upon the passing of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| But the simplest way would be for them to let me know as the permit manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| They would say, hey, we saw this person or the scooter at this time at this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| I would be able to take that information, communicate with the vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| and that fine would be passed to the vendor at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| as we discussed a couple of weeks ago in first reading how that enforcement mechanism works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| Ms. Singh, Chief Thomas looks like she has some to add, some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| Please, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| So exactly what he said, but on a practical level, downtown we have cadets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| They are deployed mostly on foot or on bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| They would be able to deal with any enforcement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| We've just applied to have our cadets increased, their authorized strength increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| so we'd have more cadets coming out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| Again, our preference is to educate first rather than go out and start issuing a bunch of citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| Education is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| So that's not our first preference whenever we see somebody doing something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| If there is a traffic crash or something that requires a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| yes, an officer will respond to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| I think we've only had one or two reports in the two years of that happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| so we've been very fortunate, and the riders are fairly responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| So we would deal with those on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| but our downtown officers get deployed on bicycles as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| So I think we have enough folks downtown between PBA, our bike officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| and our cadets to deal with infractions that may come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| And as far as how the scooters are deployed or parked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| our officers can even take a picture, get it to the vendor so that they can take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| There's a lot of ways we can help and educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| I'm concerned about overworking the police even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| I have one other question about this being used as transportation versus recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| I think Dr. Cherry had said some statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| and I mean I'm very much in support of it being used as transportation, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| But the statistics seemed high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| How sound are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| How did we figure out these numbers, if you don't mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| Thank you, Dr. Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| Yeah, so there's been a lot of surveys, first of all, that have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| The work we did in Nashville was looking at the trip data itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| We had 2 million trips or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| that we were able to look at specific trip patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| where people are coming to, going from, time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| So we're using the big data, whiz-bang, machine learning stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| to kind of classify clusters of trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| So there's a lot of trips around Vanderbilt, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| middle of the day going from one part of campus to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| That's not really like a joyride, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| The trips that are going around Broadway, four blocks in circles, those are joyrides, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5352)|
| 1:29:18| And so that's how we kind of did that part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| and time of day and everything else matters as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| And that corroborates some of the survey work that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| how would you have substituted this trip if you'd taken it by a different mode of transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| And a third or more are often Uber, Lyft, drive your own car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5375)|
| 1:29:42| People don't Uber to have fun, so they're actually going somewhere to get someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| And so there's been a number of studies that have looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Having fun is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| I think somebody mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| They can be fun, and it's actually kind of nice to have fun when you're trying to get somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| And so for me personally, I'm a transportation engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| When we talk about greenways, should you go out and have fun on a greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Can you do it while having fun and getting somewhere at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| So Visit Knoxville is interested in scooters, at least early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5411)|
| 1:30:19| I don't know what their stance is now, but as a way to get around the city and have fun doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| So there's some blurred lines in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| There's not a definitive line that says, you know, exactly 72 percent of scooter riders are doing one thing or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| But a lot of it is to get around and have fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| One of the things we did notice is that a lot of the folks that were hit and injured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| and we're talking about police data, we did some safety analysis, were locals to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| Locals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| They were locals to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| To Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Oh, the work we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Oh, the study in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Yeah, the study we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| So when you think about Nashville, you think they're all drunk tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| What we found from the data was they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| And so I think the vendors and operators have a lot of this data, too, that show that locals use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5463)|
| 1:31:12| and they're close to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| They're not using it just to have fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| They're going places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| And I'm not anti-fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| Yeah, that's all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Council Member Roberto and then Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| I think since we've addressed the Greenway issue, there's really, what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| is two additional issues to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| And I listened to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| I think it's been very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| So one is about infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| And I see that in a couple of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| One is the number of units that we're allowing to deploy in this proposed ordinance versus the number of corrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5507)|
| 1:31:55| And I certainly would be supportive of making sure you're very intentional with the number of corrals you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5515)|
| 1:32:04| corresponding with the number of units you're allowing to go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| because we've heard over and over again about issues with clutter and issues with access to sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5529)|
| 1:32:19| or just them piled up somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| And so I think that's an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| The other one is even thinking about greenways in the future or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| I had one constituent who mentioned to me, visiting another place, another city where they had greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5552)|
| 1:32:40| and they actually had an expanded greenway space where there was a dedicated place for bikes and for scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5560)|
| 1:32:49| and then a dedicated place for pedestrians so you don't have people weaving in and out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| That would be an expensive proposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| but I think thinking about safety of all those that are using our greenways is an important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| so thinking about that infrastructure as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| So corrals and wherever you're going to be doing an expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| The other one would be enforcement, so we're hearing a lot about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| So one thought I had was where you have the corrals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| is it possible to have some signage for something where you can use your phone to scan it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5597)|
| 1:33:25| or a phone number you can call or text that gets a rapid response for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| hey, I'm seeing people using the sidewalk right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| And that can get to the owners, and then they'll know who's doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| and so they can deal with them and say, hey, this is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| Give them warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| But have some kind of rapid response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| It could also be, hey, I'm walking to the Civic Auditorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5627)|
| 1:33:54| and they're all piled up like over here, and there's a rapid response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| So some person can get that information to somebody who can correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| Has there been any thoughts about something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| Mr. Hong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| That is a fantastic idea, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| Yes, each corral will have a sign associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| Our thoughts initially, working with engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| with that it would just say that it was designated scooter parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| I think we could put a number on there to let people know who to call if they see misuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| whether that's 311 or a vendor directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| Vendors are going to be able to react quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| Just one less cut out the middleman here, which is essentially 311 and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| But, yeah, absolutely, we can include that information on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| And, again, that signage is built into the cost of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| Just put your e-mail address on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| That's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| But I think that's something to think about is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| we're hearing a lot about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| Well, if there's an issue that's occurred and it's not corrected very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| we're going to hear more reports of issues, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| But if we had a way of having a rapid response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| I think that would be a good thing to do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| And then the other thing would be I would think that with regard to clutter especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| if the last user is going to be known by the provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| and if they pick up an area that's cluttered, like it's in the grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| like one of the examples was there was a sidewalk somewhere it's not supposed to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| is there a potential for the provider then to let that user know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| hey, you know, we had to move your scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| It was not in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| You didn't, you know, put it up properly as sort of a warning or educational opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5743)|
| 1:35:50| which could lead to something else if you ended up with somebody who's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| you know, really abusing the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Is that something possible too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| It would be up to the vendor how they want to approach their own terms and user agreement infractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5759)|
| 1:36:08| You know, a user is going to have to sign that before being able to use the scooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| so that's really between a vendor and the rider whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| or not there's any sort of fine instituted for misusing or misparking a scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| I will say that when we initially were going under the pilot in the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| this was, you know, talking with, precedes my time with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| but in talking with the folks who were around managing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| they have let me know, you know, since the conversation actually on first reading for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| that when riders were cited and let known about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| the recidivism rate was extremely low, or sorry, recidivism might not be the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| but the amount of riders who once they were cited had another citation brought against them in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5806)|
| 1:36:55| very significantly dropped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| I think it was something like 2% of riders that had one infraction ended up getting a second infraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| despite ridership staying continuous with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| So we have seen before that this model of, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| everything is going to be as proactive as possible to keep misuse from happening in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| but we do even in Knoxville have our own experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| I don't know that we have hard numbers to go along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| but we have a significant amount of experience that shows us when we do let a rider know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| that they have misused a scooter, whether or not a fine went along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| we don't see them misusing again as much as you might think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| So I think that example is really good reinforcement for thoughts on the administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| which would be make sure that there is a warning given, because like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| you get a warning or you ended up with a fine, potentially the likelihood of you repeating a violation is low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| I think what we're talking about here is, you know, providing an alternate ability for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5869)|
| 1:37:57| And if we're constantly have to drive trucks around, like has been said, to fix stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| then we're not really improving the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| And if there's clutter everywhere, then we're going to be hearing about it and there's going to be issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| So I think being intentional with those administrative rules to make sure you're not –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| we're addressing the issues that you've already heard and you're hearing today with ideas like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| or other ones that you may come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| I think you need to really make an effort to make sure we don't hear about this again in four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| which I think was – somebody said four months at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| So that's what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| Can you refresh my memory again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| What's the age limit on scooters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| I couldn't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| I mean, I intend to support this, but you all know it's been hard to digest some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| But I would just implore the team to really think about, you know, stricter rules and guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5935)|
| 1:39:04| and having stronger accountability, especially for the riders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| because most of the onus right now is on the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| I think there's got to be more provisions, in my opinion, and I guess that goes back to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| But, you know, for the organization, it's a reflection on our city and the aesthetics of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| people driving through our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| But I think most importantly, a robust enforcement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| Again, you know, it's about setting the expectations early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| and really promoting responsible and safe ridership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| So, I mean, that's really where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| You know, I recognize the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| I've ridden them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| But I've also seen other cities that have really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| put a really good sound infrastructure around usership and ridership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| Thank you, Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| I think we've had a good discussion on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| I think it's been helpful to follow up from the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| I'd like to encourage the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6005)|

| 1:40:09| No more lights are on, so I think we'll make the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| Does everyone understand what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6015)|

| 1:40:27| Council, do you want to have a short recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| Let's reconvene at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6030)|

| 1:41:20| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| I just wanted to thank Rob Monday for spending a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| talking about this project over a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| I think he's pretty passionate about this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| This used to be, I think, 11, 12, 11 apartments maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| And one of my questions when I went out to tour the property was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| why aren't people able to live here right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| And when I got a tour of it, I was able to see that it needs quite a bit of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| And we were also able to go down into the crawl space and basement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| and see some support that is needed in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| So there's quite an extensive amount of work that needs to be done to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| property, and it's roughly about 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| So I'm excited to see this project come into fruition and a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| amount of return, even with the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| So I look forward to seeing these apartments come back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| North Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| This is a project that has come before us that also received some funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6146)|
| 1:42:34| for the city to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| Yes, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| This has also received funding through the Historic Preservation Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6160)|
| 1:42:48| I just wanted to comment that it is difficult, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| as more projects like this come before us, it is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6175)|
| 1:43:04| I can't blame the contractor for seeking this level of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| If it's available, why not seek the support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| But I do believe that, you know, many of these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| and this one included, I'm struggling to see that there is a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| need for it to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| And I think we might be able to achieve some of our goals as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| better if we put more restrictions on the pilot award so that we can put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| more emphasis on affordable housing in these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Council Member Riders and Council Member Fugate, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| let her go first since you already spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| I'll defer to my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Mayor, I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| I appreciate the fact that I understand what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| Council Member Parker, but a 1.3% return on an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| isn't even really what you can get in much of anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6247)|
| 1:44:14| with a lot less risk involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| And while I want to support this because we have a building that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6256)|
| 1:44:23| to be rehabilitated and is financially not viable to be done by someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| on the private sector because they have to have a rate of return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| to take the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| So I fully intend to support this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| And thank you, Mr. Mundy, for fixing up a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| Council Member Rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| Yeah, and I just wanted to respond to those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| And if Mr. Mundy wants to come up and speak to rates of return, he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| But I was under the impression when I made my comments a minute ago that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| most of my colleagues had, or all of the colleagues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| had spoken with Mr. Mundy about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| He did indeed get past assistance, and when he ran the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| and the increase in materials, the project wouldn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| and it wasn't viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| This project and the other pilot that we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| right now your rate of return on investments in the stock market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| or in any bank account is 12%, 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| We're voting on a project right now that without a pilot is 1.3% return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| It's just not worth it for someone to give housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| And, Mr. Mundy, do you mind commenting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| so I don't have to dig through the packet, on the cost for the apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| Because that was the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| The rental rates that I thought were pertinent to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| is a very reasonable market rate for what you're charging for the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| Can everyone hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Today I live at 1234 Armstrong Avenue, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| So these apartments, the building footprint itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| lends itself to having very small apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| and by function of that they can be offered at very reasonable rental rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| And so you're looking at mostly one bedrooms and studios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| in the $850 to $900 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| This building is directly beside a bus stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| and I think honestly it has the capability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| as much as any other building that would be anywhere close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| to provide good affordable housing to folks who want to work downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| And, Mr. Mundy, with the pilot, what's the rate of return on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| So with the pilot and with the Historic Preservation Fund grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| you're looking at a 5% return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| So could you take your money and put it in a certificate of deposit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| or some other stocks and make more money off of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| There are plenty of other investments that would easily achieve that return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| with much less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| Honestly, we started pursuing this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| not because we were attracted by the financial return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| Honestly, I just believe that that's what this building needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| I think it's the right long-term decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| I really appreciate your passion for wanting to bring these apartments back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| and make them viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| and for sharing with me the condition that they were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| And I look forward to seeing the project completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| I just wanted to clarify that, you know, within these negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| if we want to see property at a more affordable price point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| and I admit this is not exceedingly expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| for what we've seen come before City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| but, you know, we can make efforts to have a longer pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| so that we can ensure that it's a good investment for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| You know, I'm not saying that we don't allow pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| but we say we need housing at certain price points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| at different neighborhoods, different parts of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| We have a developer who's committed to this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| who's committed to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| If we initiate those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| regarding how we can even get to a better price point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| I think that, you know, contractors will be amenable to those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| But if we don't have those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| and we're okay with market rate serving our public purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| then that's what we'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| But I'm not opposed to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| I'm in support of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| I just want to see stronger negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| that get the city the affordable housing that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6531)|

| 1:55:14| The Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| The local DA is also on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| It will be determined about whether the funds will be accepted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| and then how they'll be utilized has to go through that statutorily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6924)|

| 1:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| So the decisions on how the money is used aren't necessarily made by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| the city or locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| They're made by a task force that the DA is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| Yes, although there will be portions of the funds that come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| that I suspect that you will be requested to appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| and fund appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| I just thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| I appreciate the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| I think this is really important because this is a huge component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| A lot of things that people perceive to be problems in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| whether it's mental health or homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| it's a lot of opioid problems that our community is facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| and until, you know, we start addressing those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| we're going to be stuck not moving forward with a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| So this is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=6979)|

| 1:56:49| First is Mr. Forrester, Taylor Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7009)|
| 1:57:00| You get your turn, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Just, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, suite S700, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7027)|

| 1:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| Mr. King, we're going to let Mr. Forrester have his five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| and then I'll call you up afterwards, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| I'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| I don't think they want to get back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| Mr. King represents the church, Central Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| which is an adjacent property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| They have had opposition to our request of the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| one-year plan amendments, rezoning, as well as our special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| We've been able to resolve those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| essentially work in the form of a property swap to modify the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7064)|

| 1:57:56| You have managed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| I think Mr. King's only caveat would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| my understanding is the church has to vote on this as a whole at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| congregation on December 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7086)|

| 1:58:16| Don't have any real concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| but we want to go ahead with the first reading here to alleviate any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| concern that we have on any kind of timing issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| because we have had several postponements already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| Next person to sign up to speak is Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| You already stated your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| so go ahead and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| I don't have much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| We're working toward what we believe is a resolution of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| We believe and hope we're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| But in case we don't, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| then we would take up our issues of opposition at the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| We prefer to just let it go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7138)|

| 1:59:06| I just want to thank my colleagues for their patience on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| allowing some additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| The few postponements has given an opportunity for parties to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| together and come to an agreement in principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| which looks like it'll be finalized potentially in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| So I hope we can pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7162)|

| 2:02:37| One thing that I was mentioning is that the draft development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| It states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7362)|

| 2:03:34| Yes, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| We have here what we would classify as conditional closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| And that condition being that the project does go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| In the event, the project does not go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| Then these right of ways revert back to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| And it was intentionally set up that way, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7435)|

| 2:04:14| And that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| That property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| Is going to be the property of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7459)|

| 2:04:40| Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| So the easement closures are conditional on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| Being completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| So if the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| In six months, I can promise you that the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Won't be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| We, we would expect that it would be underway, but it would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| Complete in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| Your question is about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7498)|
| 2:04:59| It's very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| From the stadium being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| And operating in 10 years, in which case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| It would be owned by the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7506)|
| 2:05:14| The other thing that I do not have in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| It's what happens in terms of the default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| In the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7521)|

| 2:07:29| Just one clarifying thing that I wanted to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| So for instance, there's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| A provision that's that says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| If there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Improvements required for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| By major league baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| And those come before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| And we don't approve those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| That's considered a default on this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| And I've been meeting with the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| And one of my concerns is that the way that the capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| Is treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| And, and the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| Requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7687)|

| 2:08:13| Is not clearly delineated at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| In my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| There could be a default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| On the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7702)|

| 2:08:28| Unless the final agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7708)|

| 2:08:42| According to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| Members of the sports authority that I've met with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7724)|

| 2:08:48| And that they're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7728)|

| 2:08:55| The way I read the development agreement is that during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| There could be a default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| There could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| There could be a default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| That could, you know, allow the developer to say, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| This isn't good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7751)|

| 2:09:17| It's still a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211214?start=7757)|
