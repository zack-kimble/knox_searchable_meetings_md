| 0:00:25| First will be on page 11, item R-11-9-807. Clerk, if you'd read into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=25)|
| 0:00:32| Approving the following documents related to the new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| Number one, an interlocal cooperation agreement between Knox County, the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:44| and the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=44)|
| 0:00:46| Two, a purchase agreement between Knox County and the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=46)|
| 0:00:52| And three, a memorandum of understanding and agreement between Knox County and the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:59| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| I believe everyone here, and I appreciate those in the audience for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| would know my position on this particular resolution, so I'd move that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=66)|
| 0:01:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| I want to say thank you for trying to wait for Sam to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| Oh, and here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| We spoke about this a little bit in the chairman's luncheon, and I have two concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=93)|
| 0:01:45| One concern is still the issue of renovation versus new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=105)|
| 0:01:55| I feel like there were ñ I understand that the community in Carter felt like they weren't getting enough in terms of the renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=115)|
| 0:02:06| that was offered, and then we started thinking that maybe we could make a ñ build a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| for the same amount as we were ñ close to the same amount as we were going to do this renovation for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| And then it just kept snowballing and snowballing, and now we're up to over $16 million for a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| when the school board has said over and over again that they believe that they can do a renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=143)|
| 0:02:33| that will achieve their objectives, and that's a better use of resources than building a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| And I feel the same way and support them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| You know, in fairness to all the kids, our established communities who have schools have ñ get renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:56| Our new developments that go in where there are new families, they tend to get ñ they get the new builds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=176)|
| 0:03:06| You know, there are schools that are older than Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| There are schools that have been renovated five or six times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| and there's not a single person anywhere that you could find that is not happy with the renovation done by the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=194)|
| 0:03:25| So I think that ñ I know from talking to some people in the Carter community that if the fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:34| of the inadequate renovation is lifted, then they feel like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=214)|
| 0:03:48| if they felt like they were getting a renovation like what Ball Camp got or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| that that would totally change the picture for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| I feel like if we build a new school for an established community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| even though this says this is not setting precedent, it is, and we know that it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| And we know that all other communities who need a new school are going to come asking for their new school next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| And if we pay for this by selling off our assets, we're not going to have anything to sell off to build anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| Nobody wants to raise taxes to have the money to pay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| So in fairness to all the communities and all the kids in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| I don't have the luxury of only considering one community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| We have to look at the needs of the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| And if we can come up with $16 million and we could give Carter an absolutely fabulous renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:57| I think about what we could do for the other schools, like the Adrian Burnett's and the Shannondale's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| and the other schools, the Richard Yokeley's, that are desperately in need of repair and renovation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| I think that we need to make our money stretch as far as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| And I don't think it is the best or wisest course of action to put it all into this one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:29| And I'm going to let someone else speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=329)|
| 0:05:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Please pardon my tardiness, but just getting off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| I guess I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I haven't surveyed the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| I see Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| A couple of questions about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| I kind of want to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| And I know I talked with Mr. Mamentoff earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| I don't know if he's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Mark is out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| We have Kim Watson here from Bassbury and Sims who can answer any questions that are in reference to the legal structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:20| of the documents you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| So let me start with the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| As you know, I'm familiar with the lease buyback process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| And this thing has evolved and gone on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| But am I correct in saying that the original process, because of economic conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:53| because of how competitive jobs are, that we were looking to have an RFP for a lease buyback for Carter Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=413)|
| 0:07:07| We did consider a lease agreement at the beginning when we first issued the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| We did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| But I will say that the document also allowed for a lump sum payment option as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| And we had six proposers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| And all six proposers submitted a lump sum option with their offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| So they didn't exercise the lease buyback or they did not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| No, they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| They did on that aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| It was determined that it would be in the best interest to pay for this school if we had available funds versus paying for it over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| When you say available funds, what are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| I mean, just strictly from the RFP, what did the RFP say about available funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| No, it didn't address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| It just said that there is a lump sum option for the purchase of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| So you all crafted the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| With the help of many others, I can't take all the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| So I don't know who this question is to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Maybe it's John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| What was it thinking about the lump sum payment at the time of the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| Were we thinking really the lease buyback and we're going to throw out an option, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| We wanted to consider all the alternatives for financing as well as construction delivery itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| But once we started looking at the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| and the thought was that if we could come up with the funds through the sale of available properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| and other means that it would be better to do that versus pay for the building over terms of 20, 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| That's the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| John, did you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| The evaluation committee wanted to be able to leave it open for the proposers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| to see what kind of creative opportunities there might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| But once the proposals were in, the evaluation committee was clear on this is what makes the most sense right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:26| for this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| And then I guess in my remaining minute and ten seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| question for this arrangement with the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| Have we ever done anything like this before where we're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| Not in the construction of a school system, but the IDB is authorized to build public buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| But I guess maybe this is a question for Todd or someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Is there any precedent for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| None that have other entities entered in this type of agreement with this kind of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=599)|
| 0:10:09| Yeah, maybe the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| I'll let Kim Watson from Bass, Berry, and Sims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| I think they've done a couple of these deals in Middle and West Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Now, I'm new to this, so do we give her a chance to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| No, Commissioner, this is an experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| And this is just for you to know how much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| So, no, we're not going to shut you down or muzzle you, so no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Again, I'm Kim Watson with Bass, Berry, and Sims, serving in for Mark Mamontoff today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| And this type of arrangement has actually been utilized by public building authorities in other areas of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| this type of construction manager development type process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| So there is precedent for it in the PBA realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| For schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Yeah, I don't have any comments for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you very much for coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| You know, I have a couple of comments about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| and I think it's very clear that the monies that we're going to spend on this have absolutely nothing to do with the education of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:13| If you look at some of the reasons that we supposedly are doing this that we've been told, is that, one, this is an old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:22| I asked you out there, what is the most recently opened school in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| It's the STEM Academy in the L&N building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Do you know what year that was built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| It was built in 1904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| So I think the fact that we're putting children in an old building is not a valid argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| The second argument about why this is different than any other situation in Knox County is that promises were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| For any of you that weren't here earlier, we had a gentleman from South Knoxville talk about the promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| that were made to the people of South Knoxville, even to the point where they bought land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| They were promised twice a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| And I think people understand that we just don't have unlimited resources to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| So that was not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| I've heard it said that there's been no opposition to this from other parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| And I would encourage the commissioners that have not had an opportunity to look at their e-mails today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| We've had 24 e-mails since this meeting began on people that are opposed to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| because they understand that we're taking funds away, not necessarily from other children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| but even for the children of the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Money is going to be spent on this school rather than being spent on things that will allow them to be educated better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| and to allow them to have higher ACT scores that will eventually allow them to go to college and get better jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| That's money that's not going to be spent on their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| And, really, the final thing is that we've talked about, and then you might ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| well, how in the world did we get here then, if that's all true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| And you have to accept that that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| It started off with the $2.5 million that was in the capital plan to renovate the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=783)|
| 0:13:11| This commission was told that we could build a new school for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| And if we're going to build a new school for $5 million, why are we spending $2.5 million to renovate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| So we sent it back to the school board for them to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| And if you look historically at what happened at the school board, there's been four votes on the school board on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| There was a 9-0 vote with the previous school board that said the best utilization of education dollars is to renovate the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:41| It's been sent back to them a total of three times, and the vote has been 8-1, 8-1, 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| And you might say, I read in the newspaper where they voted for the Carter School, because that's what was reported in the headlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:56| What actually happened was that Dr. McIntyre sent a letter, and really what they voted on, if a new school was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| that the school system did not have to pay for it, would they accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| Well, how could you not accept the school if someone is going to spend $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| and just let this building sit there unoccupied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| But I think there's no question, if you ask the school board what is best for the education of the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| what's the best utilization of resources, they'll say it's renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| So then we went from a $5 million school to an $8 million school to a $10 million school to a $13.8 million school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| And that's where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| And we're saying $13.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| That's what it costs to build a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| Now we're disputing what it costs to get the furniture, the fixtures, and all the other things that we need to run the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:50| The school board says that costs $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Well, from people who don't routinely do this, they're saying, no, it's $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| So let's give everyone the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| We're up now between a $15 million and $16 million school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| Now, what's happened to the other schools we built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| We saw that the Hardin Valley School went from a $40 million to a $50 million school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| We haven't even, well, we've sort of turned to shovel of dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| but not much on the new school out at North Shore and the Pellissippi, and it's already starting to escalate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| And I don't think there's a single person in here that's serious, really believes that we're going to start this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| and get it finished exactly for what we think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| And I have to admit, if they came back to me and said, well, we can put in a geothermal system that will save money for the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| or we can put in special thermal pane windows that's the newest thing that will save energy and make it more economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:42| I think we would all vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| I would vote for that once we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| But these are the things that come up that we don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| And, you know, if we look at all of this, and I've talked to some people, there's a lady that has children that goes to the Carter School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| that I work with eight hours a day, every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| And I've asked her what she thinks, and she said, well, we need to fix that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| But even she told me honestly, she said, it's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| She says it's bad, but it can be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| The school board has an excellent record of renovating schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| And, Mr. Chairman, what I would like to do as a counterproposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| I would like to make a substitute motion that we send this back to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| with the directions that we not look at doing this $2.5 million, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| I've been told by people who have children out there that that may not be enough to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| but to have them re-look at this and not try to do a good renovation, but make it a, you know, a superb renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:46| And I would be even willing to vote for extra funds as we do this to put in the newest, the latest technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| that we need to educate these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| We're spending all of our money on a structure and not on educating the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| And for that reason, I would like us to look to see if we can't do more for the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| than we're doing for the adults who think we just need a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| There is a substitute motion on the floor that we send it back to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| and ask the school board to look at more substantial renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| And spending some of that extra money to put the latest, the most up-to-date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| the most modern techniques that they determine is what we need to educate the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| because that's what we ought to be talking about, not about a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| I'm just asking for a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| We have to vote on the roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| I'm sorry, what are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| I'm just asking for a roll call vote on the substitute motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| I don't care for this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| I'm just asking for a roll call vote at the end of the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| I thought you were calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| When I look at where we are right now with the people who want an up or down vote today on yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:10| or no on a new Carter school, some of this information we've not received until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| We could have gotten it earlier, but it wasn't sent to us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| It was held until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| And it's not even a complete list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| It says on here also other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| These are what they want to sell to pay for this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| And these have not been appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| We don't know that these are the amounts that we'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Something else that I want to point out is that, you know, we're talking about Solway sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| We've got $2 million for Solway that we're going to put towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| We lost $3 million in that transaction based on the purchase price that we paid for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| and the improvements that we did to that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| We sold it for $2 million and lost the taxpayers $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| I'm not in favor of selling any more of our assets at a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| And I think you have to factor that in to the school's cost as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| When you look at also the demolition costs, the $13.9 million, like they said, is just for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:35| But we've got pretty much a blank check for things like if IDB wants to get insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:45| if they want to bring in consultants or advisors, we're agreeing to give them staffing support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| And all of that, there's not been any budget made on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| There's not been any estimates of how much it's going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| And I'm, frankly, very uncomfortable voting for something if I don't know how much it's going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| We have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Nobody has any idea how much that's going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| But it's in there that we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| When you look at the $13.9 million for the school plus the FF&E, which is probably closer to $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:25| and you look at any extra things that the IDB feels like they need to purchase to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| which is insurance, consultants, advisors, staffing support, the demolition of the original school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:42| you're looking at probably close to $20 million for this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| So to say that this school is only costing us $13.9 million is disingenuous at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:55| When you add all of this together, it's going to be close to $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| And if you add in the loss that we're going to get from selling this real estate in a bad market, it's going to go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:07| Right now, we have the money in the bank that if we send this back to the school board and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:17| we don't want just your standard renovation that you do for schools and established communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| We want the best renovation you've ever done for this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| We want an absolutely fabulous renovation with everything that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| And we're going to put in the extra money that it's going to take to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| Even Dave said at the last meeting that if he felt like we were going to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| that they were going to get a renovation like the one at Ball Camp, that he was in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| So I think it's where we started was with people in the Carter community thinking that two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| and a half million just wasn't enough to do the kind of renovation that they deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| And they may very well be right about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| But as Dave said, if we can do as good a job renovating as we've done at these other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| and I want to do an even better job renovating than what they've done at other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| We can trick out the classrooms with the latest technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| We can really put the dollars where it counts, which is towards the education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| And then if we do, if we are able to come into some extra money through transactions that are reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:45| and do make sense, then we can move on to these other schools in a more timely fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| and get more children into the kind of facilities that they all deserve to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| So I would ask that it be sent back with the instructions that we want the best renovation possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| and that we've got enough money in the bank right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| And something else that somebody mentioned today during the chairman's lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| how much do we already have banked toward this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Approximately ten million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| We could start working on this immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| The money is in the bank ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| We could start on this renovation right away as soon as the school board approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| And I would also ask that the parents and the PTSO be given a role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| in discussing what that renovation would look like for that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| because I think that they need to be heard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| If I might, I'd like to address the commission and the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| The precedent for this has already been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| It was set in 2004 when parents in the Farragut area came to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| and came to the commission and said, we have overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| We've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| We need to fix this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Meetings were held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Options were looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| We looked at the old Kmart across the street from Farragut High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| as perhaps renovating that and making that into the ninth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| We looked at building a new building near Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| We looked at purchasing land adjacent to Farragut High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| but as you might imagine, the cost of property in the Farragut area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| was such that that was an option, but it was going to be an expensive option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| So as we continue to look at options for relieving overcrowding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| parents drove that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| It was not school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| School board did not have it in the plan to build a new high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| nor did commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| So it was parents who came in and said, we believe we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| So the precedent has already been set because we have folks here from the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| who for years, not months, years, have come before the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| and have come before the commission and said, we need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| We need a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| When you look at the capital improvement plan for fiscal year 2004 through 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| in the capital plan at that time was $13.2 million for a new Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| If you look at the capital plan from 2006 through 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| there was monies there for a new Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| There's no question we have needs at other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| There's no question we have needs at Shannondale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| and I've heard from those parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| There's no question we have needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| and I haven't heard from anyone at Richard Yokely, but I'm sure there are needs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| There are needs all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| But these parents have driven this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| If they had not stood up and said, we want a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| and we think that you can do it for us, and it will help our children learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| it will help our teachers teach, it will help our environment here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| I have said from the very beginning that I will vote for a new Carter Elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| and I will vote to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| We have 26 acres sitting out there to put this school on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| It was purchased a while back by the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| and they said at that time Carter needs and deserves a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| It has been consistent that Carter needs a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| The renovation has come up in the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Perhaps renovation is worth looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| but I do not believe that we can properly renovate that school for $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| I just don't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| And give them the type of facility that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| But since we do have the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| I do believe that we need to take into consideration the fact that these folks have had a promise made to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| not on one occasion, but on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| I do think that we need to take into account the fact that there are other needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| and let's address those needs as we move forward as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| But my position is I will be voting against sending it back to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| I think that we've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| We have had many meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| We've had forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| We've had public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| It is time for us to say either we're going to build these people a new school in the Carter community or we are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| And if we are not, then let our votes reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| But my vote will reflect that I believe we need to have a new school in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| If we get here a year and a half or so from now and we're $2 million or $3 million short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| I will vote to go to the bond market and have the necessary funds to build that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| because I believe these folks deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I've been to Carter Elementary on a number of occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| and I don't think that there is any question that that facility needs to be not just renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| but it needs to be built and we need a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| So, with that, let me continue on with our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| I would like to ask Commissioner Wright, he doesn't have to respond if he doesn't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| but if he would care to respond to the ball camp analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| I think he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| I think I heard him say something a few weeks back about if he could get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| it would be satisfactory if there was a renovation to that extent and that extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| And, of course, that would not be $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| That would be multi-millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| I don't know what the number is, but it would be five or seven or eight or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| I'd appreciate any feedback from you, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| I've been to several renovations that have been given to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| I've been to Cedar Bluff Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| I've been to Powell Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| I've been to the STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| I've been to ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| The ball camp renovation cannot take place at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| because the ball camp school is a later model school with all concrete floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| and is approaching $7 million and maybe more, my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:48| The thing about the ball camp renovation, I went even further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| and said if Sturkey Elementary could be moved to Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| I would think the parents at Carter would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| And it was built in 1959.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| I was doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| I was saying that to make the comparison that $2 million will not provide a satisfactory renovation at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:13| $7 million will not provide a satisfactory renovation at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| because then you begin to approach the fact of decreasing return on the investment dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| $7 million would be throwing good money after bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| if we're comparing it to a $13 million new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| So you did hear what I said correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| What I didn't say at that time was that you can't renovate Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| and make a ball camp out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Joe Lee, don't start me now because I'm going to call some people on deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| I'm going to take them a while to get up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Doug Dillingham, you were going to look up some information, so I'd like to have you at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| I'd like to have Hugh Holt at the podium, and Mayor wants you to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| And, Troyer, you're on cleanup, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| So you can start the clock when they get up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:25| Is Hugh Holt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| You might want to help with, I think Doug can, I don't know if I'll need you, but I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| That's a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| You want to say who you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Doug Dillingham, Knox County Schools Facilities Department, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| Doug, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| We were looking at last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| We didn't get to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| But we're looking at, I'm going to look at a comparison of a new school renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| and what we've got now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| You're saying now there's the square footage is how much there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| There's approximately 40,000 square feet in the existing Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Does that include the portables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| And there's two portables, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| There are actually four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| There are currently three that are being used for educational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| So the renovation would take us, what, to 70,000, you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| And a new school is going to give us 89, almost 90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| How many classrooms are in the school now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| There are, including the ones in the modular classrooms, there are 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| So you've got 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| And the renovations will give us four more, best I remember, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Six more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Thirty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Six more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Thirty-five classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| For renovation, we are adding four new classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| And we are repurposing some of the spaces inside the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| So you're basically going to go to 33 total with the renovation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| She made the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| She showed us 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| No, I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| I'm doing three scenarios here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| But the new school is going to give us 35, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| I believe it's 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| The new school is going to give us 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Mayor, can you add what they're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| People from the construction come up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| They're kind of putting them on the spot a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Can you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Daryl Johnson, 2240 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| There are 35 classrooms in the new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| It's 89,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| So we'll be going, all right, getting six total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Mayor, if you'll come up there real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Let me just ask the mayor a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| Mayor, we're talking about selling assets and stuff like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| But the way I see it, no matter what you sell and no matter what you're transferring it from one asset to another asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| So, in a sense, we're not losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Are we thinking along the same lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| And I are thinking along the same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| The next thing, this sheet shows us that we're needing 13.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| You've got 10.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| We're needing, according to Mr. Owenby's math today at lunch, we can need $3.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| You're also saving us, you're putting back into the debt fund, you're putting back $20 million every year over the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| And according to Commissioner Owenby's math, that's $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| But you're doing $20 million every year for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| So, for two years, in two years you're going to save $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I don't think it would be a bad scenario if Mayor Burchett went and in two years he said all I got to put in was $37 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| I had to put $3 million back into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| I don't think that's a bad scenario, Commissioner, but I believe we're going to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| I think you are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I think we're going to find it in these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| You know, and, Commissioner, that's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| This man's saving us $20 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Over the next year he's going to save us $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| All we have to save, and he hasn't even done the first thing yet, to sell, all we need to get is another $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| and he's got $40 million that he's already saving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| So, you know, I like the math on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| I guess I'm, you know, this conversation has, it ebbs and it flows, and then we end up in a whole different part of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:49| You know, we talk about, I think we've been consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| And I do understand what you're saying, Mr. Chair, as far as the Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| But the second word is a key word, the Farragut overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| You can't draw a parallel because, as we've said, as a school board, the consistency has been when it's an overcrowding issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:16| when it's a population issue, that's when we deal with new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| So to say, well, Farragut, parents got after them, and all that did was potentially accelerate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| I mean, folks knew that Farragut had to have a solution to their building demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| So it was a matter of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| So I thought we were consistent in saying when there's an overcrowding issue, that's when we deal with new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:48| And quite frankly, I enjoy not being in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| I don't personally, and I'm sure the folks of Carter enjoy not being in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| And all the rigmarole that goes with going to the market and going to school and going to other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:10| and not dealing with the traffic issues that is West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Some people like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| You know, I just left Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Folks love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| They love that congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| And that comes with us having to fulfill those needs when we start doing our projection and looking at student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:29| Then we shifted to start talking about potential savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:39| And this maybe is a question for the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| I don't know, and he may not have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| But in terms of how much money are we spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| And this may be for Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Once we renovate a building, what are our ongoing maintenance costs as opposed to the ongoing maintenance costs of a new construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2211)|
| 0:37:04| You know, can we compare Dogwood or Amherst to, you know, Rigsdale or Ball Camp or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| Do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| I'm Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Doug may be able to give you more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| I'm not sure I can give a general answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| I think you'd have to talk about specific renovations versus specific new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| I mean, oftentimes when we do a renovation, particularly a major renovation, we will look at infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| We will look at HVAC systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| We will look at other types of environmental issues and make sure that we put in newer equipment that will be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:41| and cost effective so that you do save operational costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| I don't know that I have, unless we are given a specific example and able to do the analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| that we have a specific cost comparison between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| And this may be what Doug may be able to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Let's pick out something like West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I mean, West or Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I think both of those schools basically had an old, old school that we did a major renovation around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| And they've been around for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Those renovations are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| What kind of costs have they incurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| Commissioner, I really have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| That's our maintenance and operations department track all of that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| our energy manager as far as utilities are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| So I know that when we do an additional renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| our program standards require the upgrades that Dr. McIntyre just spoke of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| So we are putting in the best and most efficient that we can get in at any time we do a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| Well, maybe this is a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| This may fall into your bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Have we had to do any additional capital improvement projects on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| on the infrastructure and the facilities that were there at those two schools in the last X number of years that you've been involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| Not to my knowledge, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| And my biggest point is, and two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| We've done a good job with renovating facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| Show me a renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| No one's come up here, and I don't think anyone can come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| regardless whether it's ball camp or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| the smallest one that we've done at a local elementary school somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Show me a renovation that has been a failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| Give me a data point that says, this one we tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| We spent a million, two million, and it didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| And then the second point is, we know how to build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| If that's the case, if that's the case, if at the end of the day the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| who's a proper entity that should be telling us this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| if the school board says a new building is required, we know how to fund those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| And we've done a tremendous job of funding those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| and been able to maintain what equates now to the bond rating that the United States of America has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| The second highest rating that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| And that's, you know, that pooh-poohing that or pushing that down, I think, is a disservice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:31| We've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Over the decades, we've done a really good job with our funding profiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| Yeah, we've had, you know, some will tax bait and switches and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| Yeah, we can get all into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| But at the end of the day, we've maintained a healthy bond indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| We've maintained a healthy general fund or rainy day fund or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| And we've been able to meet the needs of our brick-and-mortar facilities, school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:11| with recreation, with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| We've been able to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| So now to have this, what I feel is an unwarranted paradigm shift, it just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:26| You know, I'm really in favor of, and I'll say it again, us getting back into our lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| and sending this to school board, sending this back to school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| the body that was elected to handle educational affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| as we are elected to fund those or not fund those educational affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| but to get it back where it needs to be, where that discussion can occur with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| And to my knowledge, my last point is, I don't think we ever budgeted monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| other than buying the property for a Carter Elementary building, a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| I don't think the commission, past commissions, have ever budgeted those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| One of the older commissioners may want to correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| I think we put money in capital improvement for renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| but I don't think we put monies for a new build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| We didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| And when did we put monies in for a new build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| He just read off the capital plans for the early 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| This is 04 through 08 and then 06 through 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| It's in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah, I bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| It's in the five-year cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| It was either voted for or moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| It was never, right, it was never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| The commission sent the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| The commission sent a capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| and the school board chose to do whatever they chose, which is, I guess, my original point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| Well, maybe it's the school board never budgeted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Maybe that's a better way of saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| So, you know, when we look at these facilities that we're talking about giving up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| and giving up forever, getting roughly 40 cents on the dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| which is about what the market will bear, which bears out with the Solway facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| about 40 cents on the dollar as we sell these treasures, I just don't think it's wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| Mr. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| Yeah, I want to make sure that it's understood that the substitute motion to send this back to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| is not so that they can say we're going to do a $2.5 million renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| You can't control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Well, we can decide how much money to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| And I think that the school board would feel that this is a good option as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:57| I know from the school board members that I have talked to regarding if they were given more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| could they and would they do a bigger renovation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| And they thought that was a great compromise, that that was a fabulous way to solve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| so that everyone is comfortable with it, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| So, yeah, I think that we could work with the school board on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| So it's not to send it back for the $2.5 million renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| It's to send it back for something much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| And as far as the ball camp comparison goes, there's no way that the ball camp renovation would work at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:40| But I think what we were alluding to was the quality of the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| And there was a concern that Carter was not going to get the same quality of renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| But so that wasn't about exactly what happened at ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| It was about the quality of that renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| and if Carter would be satisfied with a renovation that put in more funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:07| and provided more technology and was of the highest quality that Knox County has ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:16| You know, when you buy something for $5 million and you sell it for $2 million, you lose $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:25| There's no other way to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| But you had the use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Yeah, but you've lost on that transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| In this climate, this is not the time to be selling assets in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| And I think that it's great that we're talking about saving money over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| That's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| We need to be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| But I don't know that we need to save it so that we can rush right out and spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| I think that, like Dr. Briggs said, all the replies we've gotten just today from parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:11| from other communities who are finding out about this and hearing about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| and they're concerned about their kids and their schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| and what they're not getting and are asking us not to build this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| And, you know, to keep saying that 13.9 is the cost, 13.9 is the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| It's actually 13.9, although it keeps being said as 13.8 is the cost or 13 is the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| That's the cost of the bricks and mortar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| The total package altogether is going to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| And that's with 13.9 for the bricks and mortar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| That's with FF&E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| That's with whatever the IDB contracts with advisors, their staffing support, their consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:56| their insurance, the demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| And we're going to the true cost of this is closer to $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| It's not $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| It's closer to $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| So it's not that we have $10 million in the bank and we only need to raise $3 million more and we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:20| So I just hope that everybody will focus on what the actual facts are in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:30| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Mayor, you were up at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Tim Burchett, county mayor, 6401 Eritrea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| Mr. Chairman, let's be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| We vote to delay this 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| You kill this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| It is dead as a doornail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| Don't vote to do that unless you want to kill this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| The motion on the floor is to send back to the school board and to ask them to look at a more substantial renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| or an upgrade of renovation with the latest technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| And to come back with us with a recommendation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| That is the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2888)|

| 0:49:39| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Next item, clerk, is 808.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| And John Troyer, if you would make your way to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| and folks, if you're going to be leaving, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| But if you would please be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| We still have more business to conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| 808, amending the previously adopted five-year capital improvement plan for physical years 2012 through 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| and appropriating funds not previously appropriated for the first year of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| John, how does Carter affect this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| And then I'll ask for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| This is the only change to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| And so there, besides the Carter Elementary, there's also $2.5 million to the school board to be able to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:21| at the Carter Middle School gym and the Carter Middle School traffic pattern improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| And so, besides Carter Elementary, then there's that additional $2.5 million for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Recently in the paper it was noted that we have some $560,000 plus from the leftover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| from the capital improvement plan that was going to be used to pay down the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| I would like for us to take a look at, I know in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and I'm sure each of you have the same problems except for you in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| that we've got some roads that need some serious work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| And I'd like to see this money spent on roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| I think it'd have to be in another agenda item and another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| Well, I just want to make sure that's not part of this package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| No, that is not part of the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| And we certainly will take your suggestion under advisement, and we can take that up on another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| You know, there was a lot of background noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| So I just wanted to make sure I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| The $2.5 million set aside for Carter, I guess that the school board said that they're going to donate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| comes out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| There's two $2.5 million pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| One is the school board's contribution toward the elementary project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| and two is renovations at the middle school for the middle school gym and the middle school traffic pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| And they're both included in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| So if we vote for this, we'll be giving them the $2.5 million for the school and then the middle school gym and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:15| That part of it has already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| So it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| No, it hasn't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| It was all taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| It was in the school board's capital plan, but it was not funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| We did not fund that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| I guess my last question on it is, what if?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| You know, I'm playing what if games, but we have nothing else to do because this thing is spiraled around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| The school board still has some actions that they'll need to vote up or vote down, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| If at the superintendent, I don't mind you just speaking on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| I think you kind of know where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| So if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| So I'm not the attorney on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| but my understanding is that because it's a different developer and because we're talking about a different school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| the proposal needs to go back to the school board to approve the conceptual design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| But the Board of Education has approved the interlocal agreement that the commission just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| So that does not necessarily need to be revisited by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| You all voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| I think your resolution, whatever you all call it, that you voted on was to donate the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| and a half million for the other entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| I don't want to call their name out since they pulled out the other entity to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| So we would clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Yes, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| The interlocal agreement does not make reference to a specific developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| It makes reference to receiving a new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| And you're correct that it contemplates the two and a half million dollar that the school board from its own capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:57| would contribute two and a half million dollars to that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| And that is this two and a half million right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| And as Mr. Troyer said, there's two and a half million dollars for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| and another two and a half million dollars for the middle school gym at the Carter Campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| and some site work at the campus as well, potentially for demolition of the existing Carter Elementary School building as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:17| Commissioner Wright, your light is on, but you want to address the commission after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Fellow commissioners, Mayor Burchett, Superintendent Dr. McIntyre, Chairman of the Board of Education, Mr. Deakins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:42| This has been more than a year and a half just of what we've done in this room at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| This does not look at anything that has occurred over the last 15 or 20 years as it relates to Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| I know the night that I said something sitting way down at that end of the table that it was a long shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3296)|
| 0:55:05| I truly appreciate everyone's interest, actions, and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| And although the mayor may have said that at one point in time we hit a roadblock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| I would like to look at this project being something that commission has taken up on its shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| and has hit several chug holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| But the most important thing I need to say right now is that I appreciate everyone's interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| Just as I have presented my opinion, I appreciate your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| And I'm ready for us to move on and do things that maybe I don't agree with, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| I can tell Dr. McIntyre didn't really agree with him on the STEM, but maybe I'll take that back someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| I do really agree with him on the mall school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| So, you see, there are issues of give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| I prefer not to be on the taking end, but I really appreciate what people have done this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:09| this evening, the last year and a half for the kids at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| No other business to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| We are in recess until 6 o'clock, at which time we'll hear zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| I just wanted to tell Dave that I have admired the work of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3396)|

| 0:56:49| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Mr. President, we received a call from an e-mail from Pam Griffin on the first item, 6-D-11-RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3410)|

| 0:57:18| If you'll have any concerns with it next month or any other subdivision people want to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| please have them in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3442)|

| 0:57:30| Could you give Jolie your e-mail address or something so that if we hear something we can let you know for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| so you don't have to come back down next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Jolie, would you get some contact information so that if something happens and it's deferred again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| we can let them know in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3466)|

| 0:57:53| District nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| Since it's in my district, I think we probably need to mirror what the city council did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| and that's defer this until after we have a, you know, more resolution on the hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| This be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Did you have a time specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Did you say 30 days or just deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| I would assume we'll have the other issue taken care of in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| As I said, we're meeting on it Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3509)|

| 0:58:37| City council postponed their decision until October 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| So your meeting next month will occur after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| So we would have a good indication of what they're going to do if we postpone it one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| So postpone it until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3531)|

| 1:01:18| Request of Knox County Commission to study and make recommendations regarding amendments to the Knox County zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| ordinance to provide for the raising and maintenance of domesticated chickens in certain parts of unincorporated Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:33| MPC, would you weigh in on this for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| We were asked to look at amending the zoning ordinance to accommodate the keeping of domestic chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| And with the city getting out ahead a little bit, we had that as a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| And they essentially put that in another part of their code of ordinances under the animals section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:59| And our only review of their zoning ordinance was to create an exception for domesticated chickens from a prohibition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:11| that currently existed in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Your code doesn't have that kind of language in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| So there really is no need to address the keeping of domestic chickens in the zoning ordinance if you create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:26| regulations elsewhere in the ordinance, such as under the animals section where you have your ordinances on the keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| of dogs and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Our recommendation is to use that city provision as a model, at least as an outline of how you would shape the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:45| and perhaps look at each specific regulation as to what you may want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| But there really is no need for you to do that through the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:58| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| So what do we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| Is this an action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| We've already asked them to report back to us on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| At this point, we have recommended no changes to the zoning ordinance in that if you do want to address the domestic chicken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| issue to do it elsewhere in your code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| Would we give that to the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| I think the best thing to do is we'll look at the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| We'll see what the city did and we'll look at our code to see where it would be a good fit and bring it back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| but not use the zoning as a vehicle by which to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| So we don't really need to take any action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| But in the city, it's like six hens, no roosters in cages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| And you may want to look at each of those numerical values that are in the city ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| and decide whether they're appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| No roosters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| I ain't giving up my rooster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| So the law director will look at that and come back to us with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| And I'll look at the bias against rooster issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| These two gentlemen came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Were you here for a specific item, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110926part2?start=3851)|
