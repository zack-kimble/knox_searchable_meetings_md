| 0:00:32| motion to approve those? Moved. Second. Thank you. All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=32)|

| 0:00:58| Tennessee, 37922. Thank you. Sergeant Hunter, what about the records? No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=58)|
| 0:01:03| applicable record. Martin? All complete. Okay, before I ask for a motion, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| want to tell us about the Tour de Cour? Sure. The Tour de Cour is coming up. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| a bike ride that's going to be taking place June 9th and it's going to be at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| World's Fair Park. It's for the American Diabetes Association. It's one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| signature fundraising events and it's what we do, it's how we raise money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| provide education, provide advocacy, awareness, and research to find a cure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| for diabetes. The event is going to be, as I said, at World's Fair Park on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| festival lawn. We have approximately 400 to 450 registered riders that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| to come out with us that day, plus about a hundred volunteers and then we have, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| see an additional maybe 100 to 200 friends and family that come down and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| support the ride. It does have four routes. There's a 100-mile route, a 62-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| mile route, a 25-mile route, and then a 10-mile route, which is the friends and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| family route. Okay, thank you. I know that we have some really experienced bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| riders on council. Do I see any volunteers for the 100-mile ride?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| Actually, I will if you will. I think George is going to come out and ride with us as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| Okay, I would be surprised if George was not there, but I would also understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| And Vice Mayor Pavlis is another bike rider, but 25 might be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| 25 is a good challenge. Okay, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| All right, do I hear a motion to approve? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Thank you. If you'll see Ms. Martin. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Okay, Casa of East Tennessee. Casa of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=150)|
| 0:02:38| I'll make a motion we move it to the Hill, the agenda. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| Okay, thank you. The Casual Pint Craft Beer...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| Oh, I'm sorry. We need to vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| Is there all those in favor of moving to the end of the meeting? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| Opposed? Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| All right, now the Casual Pint Craft Beer Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=180)|
| 0:03:09| If you would give us your name and address, please. Nathan Robinette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=189)|

| 0:03:17| Okay, thank you. Sergeant Hunter. No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| Ms. Martin. We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| Okay, do I hear a motion? Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Thank you. What this means is that once all these inspections are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| Ms. Martin or Ms. Day will have your permit. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| You need to see them before they leave? Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| Madam Chair. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Could we have them tell us, are you home brewing your beer or what are you doing as your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| No, sir. This is our second location. We're opening up on Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| We currently have a location in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| We opened last November, so we've done very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| It's a retail store with craft beer only, so you can come in and mix a six, have a pint, fill a growler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| take a package home with you, and we're looking forward to being downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| Good luck to you. Thank you. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=248)|

| 0:04:27| Sergeant Hunter. No applicable record and the missing applications have been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration and approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| Okay. Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=287)|

| 0:04:57| How are you guys doing? We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| I don't even think I need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I think you do, because we need to have this recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Gavin Lawyer, 5211 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Ms. Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| No record and the task requirement has not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| Do you know what the task requirement is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Yes. I do it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| The last place I had one, I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| I will take care of it either this week or next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| There was a bit of a red flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Has that been resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Is that the Highland Funeral Home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| It has not been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Okay. I think that someone contacted you that the Highland Funeral Home is closer than 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| What are we doing to either move them, you, or work something out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| I don't know what to do because I'm already putting three exits in the front of my building so people can get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| I don't know what else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Well, you look like you're about ready to open as I've driven by, but that's probably not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| It's all false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| All right. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| I've got at least a month and a half, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| We understood that he was applying for a liquor permit, and that would resolve the issue for his beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| and I failed to mention that when we were speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Have you applied for a liquor permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Not yet because I have to get everything else, the Board of Health and everything else passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| and I probably have to be open for a little while before I can get my liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| No, that's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| That's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Well, I was going to ask counsel, what's the rule when we have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| This is 231 feet from the funeral facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Well, the beer ordinances specifically provide that that issue is waived if the applicant has an ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=419)|
| 0:07:10| but right now there is a distance problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| So he's indicated that he would have to be open for a while before he could get the liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| No, is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| I thought you have to be open and everything all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Counselman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Yes, thank you, Madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| This is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| What did you say about the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Has he taken the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| It was the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Has that been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| The last time he attended was 3-3 of 2010, so it expired by a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| When is the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| We give it every Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| The task class, though, is not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| The issue is that I've done it three times already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| I go every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| This is only been a month now that I've been trying to get my permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| The bigger issue right now is the Highland Funeral Home issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| I think what we ought to do is postpone until he resolves the issue with the ABC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| If he gets that, then this is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| That would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Because we can't approve this as long as it's within 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| How long do you think you need for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| To go take the task?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| No, to get your ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| I was told now that I have to be open for a little while to get it to be approved by everybody in the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=517)|
| 0:08:46| before I can get my liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Councilman Grieve has moved that we postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| Does that come close to coinciding with your opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| I probably won't be open in 30 days, knowing the way things are going right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| How much time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| I hope June 1st, but it doesn't look that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| 30 days would put it on June the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| That would give you time to resolve a couple of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Why don't we just say two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| That would be July the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| If you get everything lined up prior to that, then you can see Ms. Martin and it would be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| No, it wouldn't either because we'd have to deal with the distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| You can't even see the funeral home from my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Let's go for the June 26th, 30 days, and then if we need longer, we can work on it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| I think I sort of had made a motion there for 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| You want 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| That may be a little bit too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| I want to be open as soon as I get this construction done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| I just don't want it coming back here in June and we're postponing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| I love coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| He likes it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| When's the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| There's June 26th and July 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| You pick what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| My motion is July 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| He's allowed to come sooner, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| He cannot come sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Well, then my motion is still July 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Ms. Martin, you look puzzled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| I look as confused as everyone else, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| If he were to get things in order, we could put him on the June agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| I should have everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| If he would come and tell us that, he could go on the June agenda because he's already been advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| I would be glad to come back in June, July, August, September, as long as I get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| That's all I care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| I'll modify my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| So now you want it to be June 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=663)|

| 0:11:20| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Make sure you come back on the 24th so that I don't look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| Or 26, whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| You might check with someone with the ABC board to make sure that you see if you can apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| because that will solve your distance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| So you need to contact them and talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| I was told I need all the information first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| I need the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| I need all the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| So if I open up first and I make some money, at least I have my beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| I can get that while that's in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| That's all I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| You're not comprehending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| You won't get a beer permit until the distance issue is resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| or you get an ABC license, which makes it moot because it trumps our local requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| So you need to call those folks and explain your problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=721)|

| 0:15:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| This says we're with 185 feet of the All Souls Church in Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| Is that the exception we've made in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=930)|

| 0:15:40| Mr. Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Is this the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Do we want to review whether it makes sense to have the dancing requirement to have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| separate ones for dancing without?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=948)|

| 0:15:57| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Actually, that was the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| If we could go through the agenda, because we have several items, and then at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| we can decide what we want to do if we need to proceed in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Now, all those in favor of a —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| My question is really nothing to do with — I wondered, you have on here Sequoia Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| for the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| But you have Green School is actually closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| I've asked that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| What was the answer on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Ms. Martin, a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Could you tell us why this continues to be the answer we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| It's downtown zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| It's zoned for Sequoia School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| That's the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Sorry, Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I didn't mean to —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| No, I would have heard you at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| And Mr. Wallace — Councilman Wallace would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| I thought it was a distance thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| I thought it was distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| It doesn't matter where it's zoned if you have a school right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| No, it's —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Well, the school isn't next door in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Neither school is next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Is it more than 300 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| And it's also farther from Market Square than 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Now, we have a motion to approve this in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1037)|

| 0:17:51| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Are those in progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Before I ask for a motion and a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| this is something that this Fear Board has been concerned with when we have a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| How do you train your employees to be in compliance with the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| We train at the store level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| But all of our new hires, anyone that would be handling or have any access to a cash register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| or anyone that would be doing any of those sales is trained, whether they're in another department or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| So everyone is trained fully in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Does that answer a question that we usually have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| You took my question this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| I was thinking ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| If I could ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Do we do a different form of training for off-premise sales, or what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| Not currently, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| That may be the subject of a future workshop also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Before I make a motion, I'd just like to clarify that this is the new Kroger's located at the corner of Cedar Bluff and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| It's a brand new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Oh, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| It's the new one that they're putting out there, which we're real pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you very much for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| And I'd like to make a motion that we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1158)|

| 0:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| The next one is Ooga Mooga's Tiki Tavern on White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1172)|

| 0:20:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Do you want to tell us about the name of the tavern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| It is not the ordinary tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| I collect a bunch of Tiki mugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1213)|

| 0:25:54| I'm Troy Hale, otherwise Buckethead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| and we're at 8039 Ramirez Boulevard, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| You've been here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| and I believe that you had some things that needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Aging in dog years, but we're in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Still I'm taking the task committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| and I'm waiting on the fire marshal, the health inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| and the building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| You have a projected date to open now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| I know you've probably had several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Yeah, that crystal ball is somewhat blurry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| but we should get our CO on June 29th, and we will open by July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Given that, I would ask for leniency on the extension of this for 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| because I'm probably 60 to 70 out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| and I don't know if you do it in increments of 30 days or how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| Councilman Grieve, I believe this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1608)|
| 0:26:58| So we first came February 21st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| We postponed it how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| We've not postponed it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| But previously we've postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| No, this is the first extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| I'm sorry, we extended, and we're asking for another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| No, I've never gotten an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| This is the end of my 90 days will be up May 21st, because it was February 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| All right, so we need another 90 days so that you can be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| This is your first extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| I move we extend it for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| See you in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| The next is Cassie's Grill on Thunderhead Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| I did talk to Jim Cornett, who is one of the owners, and he could not be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| They are expecting to open on June the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Everything seems to be falling in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| The stars are aligning and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| So he has asked if we could postpone or extend until June the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| Councilman Grieve, this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| You have a very busy district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| You and Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| And where's his letter saying he couldn't be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| I spoke with him on the phone this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| I'm not going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| You're not going to make the motion to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| No, because I think, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| He explained to me that the issues have had to do with the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| and the construction part of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| and that he had other engagements tonight, could not be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| nor could the other partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| He was hopeful that we would, since they're fairly confident they're going to be able to open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| and have everything done by June the 18th, we could extend to June 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| He felt that they would absolutely be open by that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| So in all likelihood, if they get everything done, Ms. Martin, we won't see them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| They'll just come to your office and pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1748)|
| 0:29:17| I mean, he couldn't send anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| No, he could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| I just have a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| He sent the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| He talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| I talked to him specifically about that, and I explained that Councilman Grieve would be unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| And he said that he was very sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| However, he just simply could not be here, and he threw himself on our mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| And I said I would plead his case, and obviously I'm not doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| I need some help from some of the lawyers or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| So moved. I'm moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| And I'd like to explain that I really, you know, think that the importance of an individual who's coming here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| for a beer permit, regardless of whether they talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| They didn't send an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| They didn't send a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| So I just think that it just says that if it's important enough for them, then they should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| That's where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| If you would like me, I will give you his number and his e-mail, and you can call him and express your displeasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I will do that when I e-mail him later tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| And the third item on the addendum is Doodles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| And they applied in Morconi's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Morconi's has gotten their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| They have their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| We're over Morconi's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| They're serving pizza, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| See, my people behave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| And your people follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| And the next one is Doodles on Clinton Highway, and we've been dealing with them since August the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| and they have asked to withdraw their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| They're going to start over from square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Well, I don't need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Is there anybody who's unhappy about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| We do need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| And a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Except their withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Before we all get excited and have a discussion on Councilman Starr's questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| we do have two groups who did not get their applications in in time for events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| and they have asked to throw themselves on our mercy and to speak with us and ask special dispensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1885)|
| 0:31:34| The two are WDVX, and it's the Bob Dylan event, and the other one is IMES,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| and I'm not sure what the event is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| So do we have the WDVX people here at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Do you want to come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Before they speak, can our Council address whether that's permissible to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| In other words, is there a publication requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| or something that doesn't get met by doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| The next special meeting that they're looking at is May the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| Oh, not today, but so there will be time to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Yes, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| And I have talked with Ms. Day, and I believe that it is doable on the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Would you please tell us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| and perhaps the reason why you didn't get your application in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Thanks for letting me appear before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| My name is Linda Billman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| My address is 3100 Germantown Lane, and I'm the general manager of WDVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| I submitted an application late due to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| the best thing I can tell you is that I had a family death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| and I lost track of when the deadline was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| So I submitted it as soon as I realized I needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| The event is June 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| So that makes the May 29th, putting it really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Now, I will say that that is our third meeting this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| and we have photographs scheduled at 6.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| So we could probably hear their case at 6.40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| and have time to be primed for our photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| So do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| All those in favor of a special meeting on the 29th of May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| It's going to be, like, ten minutes before the council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Yeah, it will be at 6.40 because our photograph is at 6.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| And we'll have an email reminder, absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| because Ms. Mitchell is really on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| We'll see you back on the 29th of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| And the other people who are throwing themselves at our feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| and asking for mercy are the representatives from IMES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2018)|
| 0:33:47| If you would give us your name, address, and a plea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| My name is Sabrina DeVault, 1105 Fairfax Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| This is an event in collaboration with IMES Nature Center and WDVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| It's a fundraiser for us called Meadowlark Music Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| It is the second year for this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| And I believe what happened is the committee got lost in a stack of paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| That's my best plea for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| I do apologize for the inconvenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| And when is your event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| The event is June 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| We have plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Well, actually, the meeting would be June 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| Oh, the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| So my recommendation is if I have a motion to hear this one also on May the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| And my experience, and I think Ms. Sayle backed me up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| is that groups like this always have all their stuff together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| So it will be just a quickly thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| So do we have a motion to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| I'm going to copy your stack so that it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| See you in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Councilman Stair, you have an issue that you would like to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2098)|
| 0:35:11| I probably need to do a little bit more homework, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| You know, why we have a permit for dancing and how, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| Sergeant Hunter probably could tell us something about the safety reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Sergeant Hunter, would you help us with that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Excuse me, I wasn't around when it was enacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| but from the discussion I've had with the law department, it all surrounds safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| The section 4-40 is called Sayle at Places We're Dancing Allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| and I believe that was enacted around the same time as the types of permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| And that ordinance tells you the minimum size that the dance floor has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| which is 144 square feet at minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| It's got to be roped off or otherwise definitively divided from the rest of the establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| and beer cannot be served there where dancing is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| So that part of the business actually has to be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| So as long as the business or as long as the dance floor is separated from that part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| no alcohol can be on the dance floor either at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| I mean, just from the article in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| it sort of seemed like the law department was saying it was sort of an antiquated law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| that they had to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| That was sort of the feeling I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Mr. Frost, would you like to comment before I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| We can, I guess, respectfully ask the recorder's office to pull out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| and see if we can figure out what the legislative intent was at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| because I guess there's a chance that, assuming it can be found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| that people might look at it and say, oh, well, this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| I don't know why we didn't think of it before it's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| or the reason for it conversely might have passed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| But I also, you know, talking to Sergeant Hunter beforehand about the particular incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| that garnered the citation and the newspaper article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| and apparently the, I guess, trying to be diplomatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| the owner was in full knowledge that they were violating the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| and were going to do so no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| and was upset that they weren't given a special beer board meeting previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2250)|
| 0:37:39| Let me go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| I just want to ask, when was that enacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Well, looking at it, it might be 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Sixty-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Councilman Delivante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| My understanding, and, of course, I wasn't there in 1962,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| but the idea is that if you have servers with trays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| and you've got people swinging and dancing, you're going to knock something over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| Someone's going to be cut or burned or something with food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| And they wanted an area that was, what, 12 by 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| and sort of separated from the aisles where you serve food and drink and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| so that you don't have these collisions and accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Someone could get hurt who's just sitting at their table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| and, you know, something gets flying off a tray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| I mean, there's a reason for separating movement from the diners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| Also, there's a distinction for this type of permit that when this is activities going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| children are not allowed in the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Chairwoman, my light's not working, but also, yeah, it should be the other Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| We'll change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| You gave the wrong command, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| You said turn off Nick's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| But, you know, also, you know, you've got a combination of people that have been consuming alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| that could have a beer bottle in their hand on the dance floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| and two young studs bump into each other, and then all of a sudden you've got a weapon in their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| So, I mean, we need to go about this with a lot of diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| and with a lot of input from beer inspections because, you know, this is a serious thing, a serious matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2348)|
| 0:39:18| Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you, Madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| You know, certainly with respect to the law, I think we can look into it a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| It seems like if there's any way we can loosen that restriction just a little bit to where there's a designated area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| and the drink can occur without having to go through the hoops that they've had to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| And, I mean, a lot of people just want to cut a rug and have fun at a particular restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| I mean, we want to be safe and do diligence to look at the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| So maybe Rob, Attorney Rob, doesn't mind doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Well, I mean, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| But, I mean, Sergeant Hunter, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| I mean, there's not much other than having a 144-foot square requirement and some separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| Then you check the box on the application of what type of permit you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| 4-40, besides the minimum square footage, it also talks about how it needs to be separated from the rest of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| and the fact that no beer shall be sold or consumed on the premises where dancing is occurring if minors are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Part of the question is it's not a separate permit because it says on here what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Right, you check the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| So you just check the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| And then that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| So it's not as though they have to jump through any kind of hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| It's that they check that box and then they have to adhere to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| So the applicant can decide at the time of the permit or the process what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| I assume if they don't have one now, they'd have to reapply for that aspect of the permit to be added, an amendment sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| And that was the case with this particular establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| It doesn't seem too onerous to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| I mean, because, number one, it forces you to check, make sure you have the clearances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| It gives the officer a chance to go out and inspect or whatever we do to make whoever does that inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| make sure it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Councilman Grieve, and then I'm going to go back to Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120515?start=2477)|
