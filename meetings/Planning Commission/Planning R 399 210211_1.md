| 2:35:36| you know, through Everett Road down to Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| And my recollection is just, you know, on the periphery of that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| and maybe Knox County Engineering might want to jump in and get their thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| but I think it was just ultimately decided that that connection to Everett Road was not desired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9350)|
| 2:35:57| from a staff perspective and just dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| We didn't pursue that any further as part of this review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9361)|
| 2:36:05| So I don't know if anybody from County Engineering had a recollection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9365)|
| 2:36:10| that discussion and determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| Mr. Snowden, would you like to interject your thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9372)|
| 2:36:16| Sure, Chairman Bilge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| We did, when this initially came in, we kind of felt like that connection might be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9378)|
| 2:36:25| And we worked with the staff at the Regional Transportation Planning Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| and had them run that connection through the transportation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9390)|
| 2:36:36| And when it came out after the distribution of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| there was- and I don't- going off memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| it was less than 3,000 cars a day that were diverted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| So we kind of just did a rough cost-benefit analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| And due to the amount of work that would have to be completed to do that road versus that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| what we would consider to be a fairly small distribution of trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| as well as we were slightly concerned about the vertical alignment and sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| where it would have to come in on Everett there, actually in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| We just felt like those factors combined didn't feel like it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| in the best interest to pursue that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| Although at first glance, we also felt like it was positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9437)|
| 2:37:25| I just want to jump in real quick because just to tag on to what Mr. Stone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9445)|
| 2:37:28| that our engineer on staff had showed a projection of only around 800 ADT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9448)|
| 2:37:34| So daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| This is good information. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9458)|
| 2:37:41| My second question regarding the concept plan is, again, the question of usable open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9461)|
| 2:37:48| And I was wondering, Mr. Mullins, is the applicant going to put in any kind of trail system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9468)|
| 2:37:56| Anything that the- because that's a rather steep area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| and I'm not sure that the concept plan really provides usable open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9480)|
| 2:38:11| Ben, you need to unmute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't think that the concept plan includes any formal walkable trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9493)|
| 2:38:21| As far as it being unusable, I think I would disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| I grew up next to several miles of uninterrupted woodlands and ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9505)|
| 2:38:30| and I use it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9510)|
| 2:38:31| But there's not any plans for specific nature trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9511)|
| 2:38:37| But I want to make one clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| Just, I think, I don't want to- I want to make sure we're not-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| the concept plan with the nine conditions, I think condition number three still relates to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9522)|
| 2:38:48| buffer zone regarding double frontage lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| And so I just wanted to make sure if that was something that was intended to be included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9531)|
| 2:38:58| that motion, or we're still, you know, just to make sure we're consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| the variances and the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| Thank you for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9547)|
| 2:39:11| That was one of the points I was going to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| I just want to make sure we are consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| I'd like to approve all nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| I see that we had that conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9558)|
| 2:39:19| But the second thing I want to add, and I've said this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| is I do think that just wood, that wooded property is good and usable space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9563)|
| 2:39:33| whether or not it has trails in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| And I appreciate the fact that that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| Mr. Commissioner Roth, would you like to amend your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| to eliminate item number three under the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9585)|
| 2:39:51| Yeah, again, I guess I, I guess I assume since we eliminated above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9591)|
| 2:39:56| it would be eliminated below, but I should have been more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| Yeah, I'll amend my motion to take out of number three out of the nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| We have a motion and a second to approve the concept plan subject to eight conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9610)|
| 2:40:17| eliminating number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| Before we go vote, I'll recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9623)|
| 2:40:23| I just wanted to concur with what Commissioner Eason said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| mainly for the purpose of providing some ongoing clarity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| what are we looking for in that open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9632)|
| 2:40:35| Because what Mr. Mullen said about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| he grew up using all these ridge tops and forests and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9640)|
| 2:40:45| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| Um, it's very different from a detention home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| So I think that's a clarification to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| I just want to concur with Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| Ms. Caron, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9659)|

| 2:41:08| I'm voting yes, only because we've already eliminated the double lot issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9668)|

| 2:43:46| Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| Do not see Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9836)|
| 2:43:56| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9836)|
| 2:43:57| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9837)|
| 2:43:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9838)|
| 2:43:59| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9839)|
| 2:44:00| Would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9840)|
| 2:44:01| Would you like any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| I don't think we have any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| This was pulled off of consent by Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| So I'll let her go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9849)|
| 2:44:13| And then you can address any questions she may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| I had a number of questions regarding this subdivision concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9862)|
| 2:44:28| because we had initially amended the sector plan from rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| to allow this level of development to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| And I had been going back through the standards that are inherent in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9878)|
| 2:44:45| allowing this level of development, which is exceeds the parcel size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9885)|
| 2:44:51| and configuration of all of the neighboring lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| I did have a number of questions to direct to staff, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9894)|
| 2:44:59| And one or two to Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| If I may start, I would like to ask staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9902)|
| 2:45:07| I couldn't tell that the required sidewalk on Kimberlin Heights Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9907)|
| 2:45:13| I couldn't figure out why it didn't extend to the end of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9913)|
| 2:45:17| And does it connect to an existing sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9917)|
| 2:45:21| I might need to let the county engineering department answer that fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9921)|
| 2:45:26| But there is a culvert at that location where the creek goes underneath the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| And that is the extent of which county engineers at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| has requested that the sidewalk be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| This is a condition or a requirement of the sidewalk ordinance for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| It's not a planning commission requirement or zoning requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9946)|
| 2:45:51| So it's a bit of their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9951)|
| 2:45:57| how they want to apply that is how it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| But my guess is that the culvert would have to be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| and it would be costly to expand that culvert at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9962)|
| 2:46:06| So I'll let the engineering department add anything to that if they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| It's in, I believe, the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| And that's why I was a little confused as to where it ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| Is it within the parental responsibility zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| So I was just trying to determine, is there a plan then to continue that sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9994)|
| 2:46:41| Because I believe the school is, I don't know if it's right next to it or just a parcel down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10001)|
| 2:46:48| And it's always difficult when you have a sidewalk that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| I just was wondering why it couldn't be extended a little farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| Is there a plan to widen that culvert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| Yes, Ms. Corbett, Steve Elliott, Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| We use the countywide transportation plan to kind of dictate what we widen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10023)|
| 2:47:08| and where we do those type, I guess, projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10028)|
| 2:47:13| We currently don't have any projects lined up for that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| but it would be something that we would in the future look to tie on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10036)|
| 2:47:20| and go ahead and take it down to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| So there would be pedestrian access from Bays Mountain to the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10042)|
| 2:47:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10050)|
| 2:47:31| My next question has to do with the parcel size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10051)|
| 2:47:35| I know that we provide a range that the applicant can then return within that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10055)|
| 2:47:42| But given the stream, the stream buffer, the impervious buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10062)|
| 2:47:49| most of the lots, half of them or a third are unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10069)|
| 2:47:55| And since the lot size average 16,000 square feet per lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10075)|
| 2:48:03| you're ending up with a buildable area of around 8,000 or 9,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10083)|
| 2:48:08| And so my question is, when you have an impervious buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10088)|
| 2:48:13| and you have a small buildable area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10093)|
| 2:48:17| does the landowner, is the landowner then allowed to intrude that impervious buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10097)|
| 2:48:23| What exactly is an impervious buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| How impervious is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10105)|
| 2:48:30| That's directed to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| Yes, Ms. Corbett, that is actually a pervious buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| We would require them when they plot to keep that buffer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10117)|
| 2:48:41| There would be a 25 foot inner that is a do not disturb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10121)|
| 2:48:44| a 25 foot outer that they could disturb, but they could put no impervious area in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| So no impervious area in it, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| But that would be planted and we would regulate that with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| through our department here as we issued the building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| I'm sorry, I'm just reading the notation on the subdivision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| They call it impervious buffer, but I don't think they're referring to permeability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10145)|
| 2:49:10| I think they're referring to whether it can then be landscaped, cleared and landscaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10150)|
| 2:49:17| I was just wondering, are there restrictions put on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10157)|
| 2:49:22| that would preclude them from clearing and landscaping next to the stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10162)|
| 2:49:27| The inner 25 cannot be disturbed as a do not disturb area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| The outer 25 can be graded and landscaped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10171)|
| 2:49:34| but it cannot have any impervious area in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| It has to remain pervious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| No structures, that type of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| Okay, two more questions and I appreciate everyone's patience with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| Each of the lots has a width of 52, roughly 52 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10188)|
| 2:49:54| And I know that Kimberlin Heights, and you're heading west on Kimberlin Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10194)|
| 2:50:00| and then south on Bays Mountain Road, because it's a wide intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| it's unlikely traffic will slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| And when you have driveways that are within 100 feet of each other or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| are we creating a hazard for the cars backing out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| Given that the buildable areas are somewhat limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| most of those driveways, except for lot one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| most of the driveways will be backing out vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| Is there a safety concern with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| Yes, Ms. Corbett, we're going to require turnarounds on all the driveways here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10232)|
| 2:50:36| That is one of the comments that we sent to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| And they're showing those on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| that there will be turnarounds in the driveways for every home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10243)|
| 2:50:50| Hey, sorry, I just wanted to quickly clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| What they're showing on the plan is just that lot one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| would have the turnaround on the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| So it was maybe a miscommunication on our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| on which driveways would require the turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| But the plan right now just shows the one lot turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| And so if I understand correctly, Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10270)|
| 2:51:18| they will all have internal turnarounds for the driveways on each lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10278)|
| 2:51:24| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| Mr. Williams, yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| Okay, Scott Williams, 4530 Anna Lee Way, Knoxville 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10289)|
| 2:51:35| In regard to the driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10295)|
| 2:51:36| I believe the comment was that Bays Mountain Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10296)|
| 2:51:44| didn't have a substantial amount of traffic on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| I don't know what that limit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| But it's more of a local road, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10308)|
| 2:51:51| And typically, the county has allowed on local roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| for driveways to access that without turnarounds in their yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10315)|
| 2:52:00| The one on lot one is obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| because it's so close to a intersection for safety purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| But the rest of them, I believe, were deemed far enough away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| that it wasn't a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10328)|
| 2:52:11| So that's why I only showed it on lot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10331)|
| 2:52:16| Given that the reason the sector plan was amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| is because it was an extension of a sewer utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| we can assume that there will be a lot more development in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10344)|
| 2:52:30| And that Bays Mountain Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| especially since it leads to Kimberlin Heights Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| might have a lot more traffic in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10356)|
| 2:52:40| So what is the driveway situation, Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10360)|
| 2:52:46| sorry, Mr. Snowden, for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10366)|
| 2:52:54| Give us just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10374)|
| 2:52:55| We're looking up on the roadway plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| Give us one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10378)|
| 2:52:59| Give us one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10379)|
| 2:53:11| Hey, Mike, do you know what the classification of Bays Mountain Road is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10391)|
| 2:53:16| It's a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| And I'm sorry, maybe I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| We don't require turnarounds on a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10402)|
| 2:53:26| Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10406)|
| 2:53:27| I had to step out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10407)|
| 2:53:28| This is Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| A part of the, we have an ordinance for access control policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10410)|
| 2:53:34| that stipulates how driveways tie into county roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10414)|
| 2:53:39| I was thinking this was a, much like you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| you know, more of a collector type roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| So I don't think we can require the turnarounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10425)|
| 2:53:48| but certainly we would recommend them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| just because of the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| we wouldn't necessarily want to see people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| backing out into the road if we had our preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10435)|
| 2:53:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| My last question is that the finding for planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10442)|
| 2:54:08| or planned development is that there is creative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| and usable open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| And I would like to ask Mr. Williams how he meets that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10455)|
| 2:54:22| The 30-foot stream buffer by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10462)|
| 2:54:27| provides more than 10% of the total land area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| of the subdivision in usable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10470)|
| 2:54:33| I suppose an easement beyond the stream buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10473)|
| 2:54:37| maybe something to the effect of a public use easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10477)|
| 2:54:41| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10481)|
| 2:54:42| I don't think that's required necessarily for the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| but it's like I said, the 30-foot stream buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10485)|
| 2:54:49| is going to be a natural area anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| So it's a substantial part of the lots themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| that could be used for open space for the lot owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| and a nice amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| So I believe that air protection of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| is the fulfillment of that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10502)|
| 2:55:08| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| And I appreciate your patience on waiting until we get to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10509)|
| 2:55:13| when you thought it might have a consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| And I appreciate the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| I don't want to do anything that would hurt your feelings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10518)|
| 2:55:23| but I seriously believe that this does not meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| the design standards that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10527)|
| 2:55:31| in which it requires compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10531)|
| 2:55:34| with the neighborhood given the small lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10534)|
| 2:55:38| And I'm afraid my vote will have to be a no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10538)|
| 2:55:41| but don't take it personally, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| Oh, nothing personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| I would like to say to that there's always a first in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| in an area and that's exactly what you have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| When you rezone an area and it's a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| you always have that exact dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10554)|
| 2:55:58| So, but I do understand your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10558)|
| 2:56:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10562)|

| 2:59:17| I see you're present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10757)|
| 2:59:21| Would you like to go first or do you have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10764)|

| 2:59:35| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10775)|
| 2:59:42| Mr. Reynolds, do you want to go ahead and present this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10782)|
| 2:59:46| And hopefully the applicant will chime in here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10786)|
| 2:59:52| Yes, I can go over the proposal again real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| I know that there was a one or two of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10795)|
| 3:00:00| from the applicant that was going to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| So hopefully they do show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| As I mentioned in agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| the project is within an existing shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10808)|
| 3:00:13| They're proposing to rehabilitate an existing old Kmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10813)|
| 3:00:17| for the indoor self-storage and for the U-Haul business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| when they're in their accessory retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| and other services that U-Haul offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10823)|
| 3:00:29| And the component of this proposal that staff is concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10829)|
| 3:00:35| is just the outdoor self-storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10835)|
| 3:00:36| that they're proposing in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| One of those storage units being located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| near the Neal Drive frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| and then two additional units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| being closer to the main entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| of the shopping center along Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10848)|
| 3:00:53| And I'll be happy to explain it in any further detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10853)|
| 3:00:58| but that's the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10861)|
| 3:01:02| The applicant, would you like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10867)|
| 3:01:11| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10871)|
| 3:01:12| I hope you can hear me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10872)|
| 3:01:13| I was having issues with the audio earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| and I wasn't able to join.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10878)|
| 3:01:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| My name is Gurnur Kaur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| and I represent the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| which is America Real Estate based in Phoenix, Arizona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10889)|
| 3:01:33| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| I think our local person who was supposed to represent us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10895)|
| 3:01:41| I was under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10901)|
| 3:01:42| he was going to represent us and talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| but I am here to answer whatever questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10905)|
| 3:01:50| you might have to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10910)|
| 3:01:55| Are you aware of the recommendation by staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10915)|
| 3:02:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10920)|
| 3:02:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10921)|
| 3:02:02| I do have the document as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| I'm sure we'll recognize Commissioner Corbluck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10926)|
| 3:02:11| Yes, Ms. Kaur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| I was wondering if you had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10934)|
| 3:02:16| to read through the exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| There was several pages of a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| I skimmed it and I didn't notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| that any of the tenants who occupy that shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10944)|
| 3:02:29| signed that petition in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10949)|
| 3:02:31| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| Did you say that none of the people signed in favor of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10959)|
| 3:02:44| Is that what I heard correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| The other tenants of that shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10966)|
| 3:02:49| the other businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10969)|
| 3:02:50| I did not notice whether they had signed the petition or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10970)|
| 3:02:54| I did a quick look through and I didn't see any names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| but I thought perhaps you would know better than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10979)|
| 3:03:06| From what I am aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| our local representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| who is also the marketing company president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| Mr. Clay McQuaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| he was constantly talking with all the tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=10995)|
| 3:03:20| and I believe he was able to talk to most of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11000)|
| 3:03:24| and see whether they are in support of our proposal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| And I am not aware of if he was able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11009)|
| 3:03:33| to get any signatures on petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| but I was aware of the fact that he did tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| that most of the tenants have no issues with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| and they would be supportive if you were to move in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11024)|
| 3:03:48| and utilize a property of this square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11028)|
| 3:03:52| which is currently underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11032)|
| 3:03:56| I would be more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| if we could postpone this 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| and actually ascertain what the existing tenants' opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11041)|
| 3:04:06| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11046)|

| 3:04:22| I think the outdoor storage is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11062)|
| 3:04:25| I'd like to make the motion for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11065)|
| 3:04:29| I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11069)|

| 3:04:40| because it is not compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11080)|

| 3:06:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11162)|

| 3:06:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11165)|
| 3:06:06| Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11166)|
| 3:06:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11169)|
| 3:06:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11170)|
| 3:06:11| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11173)|
| 3:06:13| 12 ayes, zero nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11175)|
| 3:06:18| Commissioners, members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| this concludes our agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| I would like if you could stay on for a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| and just talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| what's trying to meet again in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11191)|
| 3:06:34| When do you think you're comfortable doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11194)|
| 3:06:37| I know I'm getting a lot of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11197)|
| 3:06:40| from the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11200)|
| 3:06:42| as well as other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11202)|
| 3:06:44| that meeting virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| has been a challenge for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11207)|
| 3:06:50| and that we need at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11210)|
| 3:06:51| to be moving away from this if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11211)|
| 3:06:54| But I'd like to hear your comments in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| Pat, what's City Council and County Commission doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11218)|
| 3:07:03| Ms. Brooks, do you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| I can with the knowledge that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| So City Council and County Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11230)|
| 3:07:11| both still meeting virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| I have not heard an end date for either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11233)|
| 3:07:22| The only public body like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| that's meeting in person is the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11244)|
| 3:07:28| I don't know why I thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| County Commission was going to meet in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| in March maybe, but I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| Commissioner Smith, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| Commissioner Jay has proposed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| that they start back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| I am not comfortable meeting in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11263)|
| 3:07:47| No, I'd like to wait until the vaccines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| are more readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11269)|
| 3:07:52| I have a question about that to Eason and Korbelik| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11272)|
| 3:07:56| because I too am very uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| moving to be in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| but my greater discomfort comes from thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11281)|
| 3:08:05| just how many people would be in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11285)|
| 3:08:09| That everybody that we see on screen right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11289)|
| 3:08:12| would be in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| as well as people that we don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| And Commissioner Phillips would, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11296)|
| 3:08:21| Would your proposal be that these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11301)|
| 3:08:24| are not just for the folks on screen right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| but for the entire public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| or just for the planning commission and the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11308)|
| 3:08:32| Well, I don't have a proposal for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| but I would assume that if we did meet in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| that it would include the public as well as some staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11318)|
| 3:08:44| I feel like it is time to make progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11324)|
| 3:08:47| towards getting back in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11327)|
| 3:08:48| It's just so many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| I think it's really hard to be represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11331)|
| 3:08:53| and for the public to participate in this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11333)|
| 3:08:58| But I don't want to make anybody uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| What I would think, I would be fine March or April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| but that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| Hey, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11347)|
| 3:09:12| We've got plexiglass between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| When the county commission was meeting in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| and I think they're voting to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11358)|
| 3:09:20| to meeting in person next month, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11360)|
| 3:09:23| They only allowed the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11363)|
| 3:09:24| who are going to speak in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| So in other words, you wouldn't have 30 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11368)|
| 3:09:32| that support or against a certain item in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11372)|
| 3:09:36| You'd only have the one or two or three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| in support or opposition in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11379)|
| 3:09:43| I think that's much better than what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11383)|
| 3:09:48| I think we're doing a disservice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| to the community meeting via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| We had three or four people having difficulties today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| I think it's time to go back to work next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11399)|
| 3:10:02| Hey, Pat, I have another technical question though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11402)|
| 3:10:06| I'm with a lot of the folks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11406)|
| 3:10:08| that I don't think that the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| is getting served well by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| we're doing this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| I just think being in a room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| looking at the body language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11420)|
| 3:10:24| I just think it's not that this is an easy button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11424)|
| 3:10:28| but I think that it's just not quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11428)|
| 3:10:30| as service oriented as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11430)|
| 3:10:35| With that being said, I also don't want to force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11435)|
| 3:10:39| a individual or a member of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| to come down to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| if they don't feel comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| So my question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| is there a way that we can technically have them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| on the big screen and they can Zoom in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11452)|
| 3:10:54| if they feel that that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11454)|
| 3:10:56| that they would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11456)|
| 3:10:58| and I still be able to hear their opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| or them to present a plan to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11462)|
| 3:11:06| Commissioner, you're asking a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11466)|
| 3:11:10| that I think is more directed towards staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11470)|
| 3:11:13| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11473)|
| 3:11:13| They would be the ones that are going to have to set this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| And I know past conversations with Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11476)|
| 3:11:20| you know, trying to have a hybrid system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| becomes more of a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| I'm not saying it can't be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| but it does become more of a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| Amy, do you want to chime in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| Chairman Phillips, I think that you conveyed that well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11492)|
| 3:11:37| in terms of there will be some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| County's Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| had a tendency to do a hybrid version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11502)|
| 3:11:45| for one of their meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11505)|
| 3:11:46| that I attended a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| with mixed results in terms of being able to get people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11509)|
| 3:11:54| But, you know, it is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11514)|
| 3:11:55| It's something that we can explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| and identify what the challenges are to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| But we can definitely look into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| and talk to county IT and see how it's worked for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11521)|
| 3:12:05| And I'd like to know, Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11525)|
| 3:12:10| if the county is having only the speakers in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| where do all the other people who are going to speak wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11534)|
| 3:12:20| Are they all stuck in a room somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11543)|
| 3:12:24| So my experience at County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11544)|
| 3:12:28| when they were meeting in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11548)|
| 3:12:29| which they've only had a few, a couple virtual meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11549)|
| 3:12:33| was that people were still allowed into the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| you know, before their agenda item was to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| So there were people in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| I will say that there's challenges associated with that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| If, you know, you all want to limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11565)|
| 3:12:49| who can come into the room from a staff perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| I mean, that's going to be really challenging to say, you know, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| I mean, obviously we can check people off a list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| but in terms of enforcing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11576)|
| 3:12:57| that's not something that planning staff will be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11577)|
| 3:13:01| I wouldn't have to be all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11581)|
| 3:13:05| You would just have the people in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11585)|
| 3:13:09| We need to be there or we need to keep on doing just what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| And I don't really have an opinion either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| I'm comfortable with it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| But if we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| I don't think we need to limit who's in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11603)|
| 3:13:26| and who can speak and be on whatever on the big screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11606)|
| 3:13:32| That I don't think that accomplishes just a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11612)|
| 3:13:36| And I think we need to just go back the way we were or keep it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11616)|
| 3:13:43| Hey, Pat, I said this before and I'm going to say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| If we're going to wait till this commission has 100% agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11629)|
| 3:13:52| on when we go back to work, we're not ever going back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11632)|
| 3:13:55| That's how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11635)|
| 3:13:56| I think we're working right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11636)|
| 3:13:58| I would agree with that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11638)|
| 3:13:59| We are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| We're not near as effective as we should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| Nowhere close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| Mr. Roth, I am never going to argue that a Zoom call replaces being in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11645)|
| 3:14:12| I don't think anybody would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11652)|
| 3:14:14| We're all dealing with this pandemic and doing the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11654)|
| 3:14:18| But we're dealing with people being safe or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11658)|
| 3:14:23| And right now with the case numbers that are still coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11663)|
| 3:14:28| and the positivity rate and the lack of vaccinations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11668)|
| 3:14:33| I don't think that we're in a position just to blanketly say we're all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11673)|
| 3:14:38| We're all going to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11678)|
| 3:14:39| Every single community member can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11679)|
| 3:14:42| Every single staff member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11682)|
| 3:14:43| That's the ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11683)|
| 3:14:44| But I don't think we're there, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11684)|
| 3:14:48| The problem is the general public is the one getting kind of left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11688)|
| 3:14:52| I mean, for us, we're on this thing all day and we do it once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11692)|
| 3:14:57| But for someone who wants to put their two cents worth on this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11697)|
| 3:15:02| it's really difficult for them to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| And I know that's hard to imagine, but it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| And so everything we're doing every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11708)|
| 3:15:11| there are people being disenfranchised that are not able to participate, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11711)|
| 3:15:16| How do we make it easier for them then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| Now, Karen, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11720)|
| 3:15:23| To Commissioner Smith's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| If we have the choice of people being disenfranchised, which nobody wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11725)|
| 3:15:31| or people potentially getting a fatal illness, which nobody wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11731)|
| 3:15:36| then how do we make it easier for those people to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11736)|
| 3:15:39| so that they are not disenfranchised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11739)|
| 3:15:42| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11742)|
| 3:15:43| Schools are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11743)|
| 3:15:45| They're actually not completely open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| People have a choice as to whether they go back or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| They can be virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11750)|
| 3:15:51| People are flying on airplanes and life is going on, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11751)|
| 3:15:58| But I mean, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11758)|
| 3:15:59| I don't think anybody should have to do this that's not comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| But I think we need to start thinking about what we're missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11764)|
| 3:16:09| Yeah, we certainly don't want to be disrespectful to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11769)|
| 3:16:14| But at the same time, Amy, I mean, like these things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11774)|
| 3:16:17| where they are meeting in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| what kind of precautions are they taking before people are coming into the rooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11779)|
| 3:16:22| I mean, is there temperatures taken and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11782)|
| 3:16:25| mandated masks and hand sanitizer everywhere and social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11785)|
| 3:16:30| you know, in the actual auditorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| Or how are they doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11793)|
| 3:16:37| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11797)|
| 3:16:38| So all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11798)|
| 3:16:40| So there is hand sanitizer all over this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11800)|
| 3:16:42| There are signs that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| suggest as there are all over the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11804)|
| 3:16:47| you know, recommending people keep distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| There are the plexiglass between the commissioner seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11809)|
| 3:16:53| There are temperature checks when you come in through the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| And then, you know, there is a mask requirement in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11816)|
| 3:17:00| There have been, with mixed, depending on the public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11820)|
| 3:17:04| you know, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11824)|
| 3:17:05| there were a number of people who were not wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11825)|
| 3:17:08| So, you know, it just depends on how that's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11828)|
| 3:17:10| But obviously, and there are in that main assembly room where you all typically meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11830)|
| 3:17:17| there are rows that are blocked off and seats that are blocked off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11837)|
| 3:17:20| to try and encourage people to sit further apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11840)|
| 3:17:24| It seems to me, if I may say that we do need to have this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11844)|
| 3:17:28| but I would actually like to wait a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11848)|
| 3:17:31| before we reach a resolution for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11851)|
| 3:17:34| One is that there are some new strains out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11854)|
| 3:17:37| which are apparently much more contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11857)|
| 3:17:41| And I'd like to see how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11861)|
| 3:17:43| It's been described as being in the eye of a hurricane at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11863)|
| 3:17:47| So let's just see how those new strains affect the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11867)|
| 3:17:54| And I'd also like to see a stronger vaccine rollouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| I agree that Zoom meetings, well, I'm sorry, but they suck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11879)|
| 3:18:04| I'm going to say that out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11884)|
| 3:18:06| But I also think that we should wait another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11886)|
| 3:18:10| and just see how well things are improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11890)|
| 3:18:13| Or if the vaccines fail to handle the new strains that are coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11893)|
| 3:18:25| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| Also, there is a local company called Ionogen that is based here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11907)|
| 3:18:32| that is making sanitizers that kill the coronavirus in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11912)|
| 3:18:40| And there's a study out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11920)|
| 3:18:41| And I've attended some meetings where they have misters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11921)|
| 3:18:44| these misters they make going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11924)|
| 3:18:46| And I'll be glad to see if they can forward Amy one of their studies where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11926)|
| 3:18:51| and we could get a few of those misters to set up in a large room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11931)|
| 3:18:54| because I've got one going in my office all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11934)|
| 3:18:57| But I'm not an expert, but I'm told they work pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11937)|
| 3:19:01| So thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11941)|
| 3:19:06| As I look at the screen and I see a lot of people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11946)|
| 3:19:09| that are much younger than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| And who may not be getting a vaccine anytime in the next several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11951)|
| 3:19:18| So if we wait for everybody to get a vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11958)|
| 3:19:22| we may be into 2022, the way it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11962)|
| 3:19:27| And then there's no guarantee that everybody's going to get a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11967)|
| 3:19:31| It might be a segment of the population that just refuses to get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11971)|
| 3:19:37| So I think that's something else we're going to have to be thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11977)|
| 3:19:41| We're not going to solve this today, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| And I don't think anybody has the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| that we're just going to open up the large assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11986)|
| 3:19:50| and allow hundreds of people in and no masks and no partitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11990)|
| 3:19:55| And we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11995)|
| 3:19:58| I mean, I'm pretty sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11998)|
| 3:19:59| So I think we can, we'll look at this in a month and let's talk some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=11999)|
| 3:20:08| I'm not expecting anybody to come today and make a recommendation we follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12008)|
| 3:20:13| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12013)|
| 3:20:15| I'd just be curious to get feedback from, I guess, each commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12015)|
| 3:20:19| how they would feel about, before we decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12019)|
| 3:20:22| how they would feel about voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12022)|
| 3:20:25| And you wouldn't be required, those that don't want to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12025)|
| 3:20:29| they don't have to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12029)|
| 3:20:30| But I just, before I even propose that, I'd like to get feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12030)|
| 3:20:35| if they would be in support of a simple vote among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12035)|
| 3:20:41| Oh, we've taken a poll a couple of times, haven't we, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12041)|
| 3:20:45| Yeah, Amy sent out a two months ago, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12045)|
| 3:20:50| I guess not a poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12050)|
| 3:20:51| Two months ago, a more recent one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=12051)|
