| 0:00:30| Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the January 2022 agenda review meeting of the Knox County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:40| I'm very pleased that we have someone, a special guest today to join us, and that's Mayor Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=40)|
| 0:00:47| He will be here now to speak with us about the new general plan, master plan that the county is undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:55| And I think, Mayor, I think I speak for the commission. Thank you for undertaking such a monumental task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=55)|
| 0:01:04| It's well needed. And we look forward to working with you and your staff and planning as you undertake this project over the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:13| So at this time, welcome, Mayor. And so pleased to have you with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=73)|
| 0:01:21| Thank you very much. I don't know if anyone will be thanking me as we go through the process, but hopefully once it's done, it'll be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| We haven't updated our plans in 20 years. That's caused a lot of issues for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| We thought the best way after a talk with Amy, the best way moving forward would be to update the general plan with a comprehensive land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:43| as well as a master transportation plan or also including a parks plan, which is desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| We decided after the procurement process to hire Kimberly Horne as consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| They are very renowned in this area and well thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| So at this time, I would like to introduce Alison Fluitt from Kimberly Horne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| who will be taking you through the presentation of how this process is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=126)|
| 0:02:37| All right. Get our technology all hooked up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| All right. Thank you all so much. I really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you all during today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| I am Alison Fluitt. I am the project manager for Kimberly Horne for the land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| So thank you so much for having me here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| We're happy to be doing this in partnership with our consultant team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Over the course of this planning process, you'll likely be seeing folks from that broader consultant team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| others from Kimberly Horne, as well as our partners planning next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| who are going to be leading the land use portion of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| as well as NITIGRAD partners in Urban 3, who are going to be helping us with economic development and fiscal analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| and also CANON and CANON, our local partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| So just to set the stage a little bit on the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| as we think about what we are trying to do with the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| this is really a blueprint for the county's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| We want to think about this in terms of goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| What are we trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| And also action strategies, making sure that this is going to be an actionable plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| and something that is functional for you all as a planning board and also for the county going on into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| We do that by making this a compass to guide that local decision making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| and getting down to some of those things that come up in front of you all every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| capital improvements, rezonings, understanding how to approach those from a policy side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| and also the more practical, what might that look like in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| Also, understanding that this is a playbook to help us secure project funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| and to coordinate with future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| And I think that fundamentally, the thing that I really see this as being most important is as a communication tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| We see this as a communication tool for members of the public, for our elected officials, our appointed officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| and understanding that as we talk to our other agency partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| we want to be sure, and even our development community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| that we have a strong guidebook on how we can actually implement some of those goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| and action items that we have set forth within this comprehensive planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| So you've heard the mayor introduce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| We really are focusing primarily on those land use and transportation elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| We see these as two equally important parts that are kind of driving the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| And then obviously understanding there are many supportive elements that we'll also be visiting through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| We have a unique opportunity to update our parks and recreation component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| and that's actually going to take the form of a parks and recreation master plan that's going to be a stand-alone document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| that's a companion to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| So why are we doing this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| You heard the mayor say it very succinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| It's time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| We have an old plan that's out there that, as you all have grown and changed as a county, it's gone out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| We need to take another look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| We need to freshen this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| And to supplement that, we've seen unprecedented development interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| We were just talking before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Even with challenges like COVID, it has not slowed down in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| There continues to be that interest and also understanding that this is not a homogenous area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| We want to be sure that we are acknowledging the local character of our communities within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| and that we're able to recognize that as we come up with those goals and action items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| And finally, understanding the opportunity that is being presented to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| and leveraging that through the comprehensive planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| Some of the outcomes that we see as a part of this are in the areas of economic development, affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=397)|
| 0:06:45| resilience, prosperity, and workforce advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| And really blending all of those things together, creating an opportunity for a more unified strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| So you've probably heard a lot of that before because you've no doubt heard all this background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| as we were coming up to the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| But now we've actually kicked off, so we want to give you a little bit of a look ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| into what we're going to be doing over the coming months and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| So we had our internal kickoff with our project management team in November of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| And that really gave us the chance to start understanding how we're all going to be working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| how we're going to be gathering data, and even getting out and looking at the county a little bit more together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| So at this point in the beginning of the year, we're going to be focusing our efforts on learning more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| and communicating about the state of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| and gathering all of those pieces of information that are of critical importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| as we begin to understand what we need to convey about where we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| and some of the needs that may emerge as a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| That will then transition into a look at future trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| We'll move on into looking at different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| This is a place where we're actually going to be actively developing alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| from a land use and transportation perspective to help us better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| what future outcomes could look like within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| and then being able to put a little bit of quantifiable metrics besides those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| And that ultimately will take us to the development of draft plan recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| where we start to emerge into more of a preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| where we have those land use and transportation strategies that are a little bit more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| and that we can all start to understand and then communicate forward in that final plan and documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| Now you'll see throughout some of those middle phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| that we have community participation identified as a very important part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| I'm going to talk about this more in a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| but it really runs inherently throughout the development of most of that content phase of our planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:58| and we see this as very much inextricably linked from the plan content preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| As far as who's going to be involved with this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| we're fortunate to already have the groundwork laid for the formation of a couple of different committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| We are going to have an advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| You may have seen an invitation that's already out posted on our project website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| where we are inviting members of the community to be a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| That is going to be complemented by a technical committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| So we see those two as really two parts of a whole to kind of help partner with us throughout this plan's development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| and make sure that they're understanding that we're on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| and able to kind of lend their knowledge and expertise to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| as we continue to go through and move with those major milestones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| We also anticipate reaching out to key stakeholders, members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| as well as county and planning staff that are an essential part of our day-to-day management of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| and then also elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| So a little bit more about what we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| We actually had the opportunity to conduct a kickoff tour of the county in early December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| which was incredibly valuable to get out and look at what's happening in all of the different sub-areas of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| some of the things that may have happened more recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| and hearing about some of the needs that already have been expressed by members of the public in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| We have initiated the preparation of our State of the County Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| We have also finalized our branding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| You can see it on this presentation actually right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| That cool little X up in the corner is part of the branding that we have put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| with our Advanced Knox logo that we have prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| And then finally, we do have a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| This is actually the mobile version that's captured up on screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| And our public engagement process, I mentioned with our committee invitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| we've already initiated that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| Now let's talk a little bit more about engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| We have three primary rounds that we see happening throughout the development of the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| The first phase will be our listening and learning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| This is where we anticipate generating ideas and identifying issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| This is a lot of us listening to what's on folks' minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| and then trying to learn more about what those goals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| and understanding some of the specific needs that may already be emergent in folks' minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| Then moving into that second phase where it's making choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| This is going to coincide more with that scenario planning area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| where we are setting goals and also choosing that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| which way do we feel like we need to head based on the information that is in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| and how we've been able to generate those different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And then finally, affirming and prioritizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| This is moving more toward that preferred scenario with our land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| and transportation recommendations where we're going to be able to review that with members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| and think about prioritization and moving that into an actionable strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| Thinking about the listening and learning phase, because obviously that's where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| we are doing a series of these briefings today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| We're actually also going to be speaking to the Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| and we'll also be speaking with the city and county commission in the upcoming weeks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| You'll see in February we're going to be moving into our stakeholder interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| as well as our initial meetings with our technical and advisory committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| And then we do intend for later in March to be that kickoff for our countywide public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| So stay tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| There will be more to come on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| So with that, thank you again for the opportunity to present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| and I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Commissioner, do you have any questions for Ms. Blument?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Yes, could you talk a little bit about the transportation part of it, element of it, and what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| Is that local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Is that interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Is that county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| I mean, what does that really mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| So what we see, I think, primarily for the county transportation portion of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| is a complement to what is already in the Metropolitan Transportation Plan, which was recently adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| So this is a great resource for us, and as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| the Metropolitan Transportation Plan is something that looks primarily at some of those higher-level roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| and is used as something that's a great resource in coordinating with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| So I think this plan is really a great opportunity for you to look at those county-level roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| and go in and understand what are we talking about in terms of the conditions that are out there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| how do we maintain these roads, how do we address some of the concerns that are out there on the county-level roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| and does that mean that we won't touch anything or talk about anything related to our higher-level roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| We will be looking at that as well, but we see that as more of a complement to the MTP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| instead of a replacement of what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Well, my biggest concern about our county roads is really our beltway system for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:22| and I know that the county doesn't control that, but is there any coordination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| any intentional effort made to coordinate some type of improvement to our interstate system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| Jeff, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| Jeff Welch, the director of the Transportation Planning Organization, also staff on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| To answer your direct question, this study will not be looking at any type of regional beltway aspect for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| That would be under the review of the Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| but more specifically the Tennessee Department of Transportation would have to take on an initiative such as that large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=899)|
| 0:15:10| Thank you so much for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| The first one is about the roads as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| In your work, do you anticipate conversations not only about the automobile traffic on the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| but in terms of pedestrians and cyclists on the roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Yes, we do anticipate that, and that will be a portion of the transportation element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| that's going to be looked at as a part of this county plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| When we are talking about transportation recommendations, we're talking about the multimodal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| We also see that as an opportunity to connect in with greenways that are either currently in existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| or are proposed within the county area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| So, yes, pedestrian and bicyclists both on and off-road will definitely be a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| The other question is about all of the wonderful stakeholder sessions that you're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| and the different points where persons can provide their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| This commission hears from people all the time when they have become aware of something happening in their particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=972)|
| 0:16:21| But I think most of those individuals aren't paying super close attention when it's not in their specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=981)|
| 0:16:29| My question is, what kind of push notice will you be executing to really get in front of those persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=989)|
| 0:16:38| who aren't on a day-to-day basis compelled to have a new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| but you know that ultimately they would like their voices to be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Yes, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| And one thing I'd just add is that Amy and her staff are key partners in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| So as you all are hearing from folks, that's one way that we can perhaps make direct connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| if there are specific concerns that are raised to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| More broadly, just to kind of get back to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| I think we see that happening primarily through the public engagement phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| and kind of the workshop series that we are outlining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| Those will likely be held throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| throughout maybe a little bit strong word because we have to have a finite number of them at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| But we're trying to be very careful in how we choose those locations so that we can hopefully maximize the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| for folks from differing geographies to have the opportunity to attend and then to raise awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| which is always a challenge, as you say, in getting folks aware that they're happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| what they can potentially contribute as a part of that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| and then how to continue to be involved following the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| So that's something that we're paying close attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| The strategy is actually still under development at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| so we'll look forward to sharing a little bit more with you as we get further on in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| This is a side to Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| I don't know how the system actually works, but for all those persons that are submitting public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| if there's any way to simply do a blast to those persons about be aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| it seems like that could be a repository of great contacts that could be alerted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| There's going to be a number of different avenues that we'll reach out to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| We'll use our own networks that we have in our own list as well as the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| and his team are really involved in this process as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| so they also have their own way of contacting constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| And there will be a number of different ways that we reach out to people, not just in public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| This may be more for staff as it relates to their process and their timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| I'm assuming there's going to be a fair amount that will come out of this that will have some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| trickle-down effect of us needing to do text amendments on ordinance changes, subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1139)|
| 0:19:08| things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| How is that ultimate endgame for us factored into this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1149)|
| 0:19:18| Is there going to be some sort of parallel process that we're going to try to do things as we get through this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| or are we going to wait until all this is done and then try to do things with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| and county commission and other bodies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| That's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| It's one that we've had conversations about internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| Obviously, this effort is going to be a monumental effort and take a lot of staff resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| I think the next step after adoption of a plan, successful adoption of a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| is to look at those ordinances and make the appropriate amendments at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| But as part of this effort, we've asked the consultant team to advise us on what those next steps might look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| and what that timeline would be going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:07| Any other questions for Ms. Fluitt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Appreciate you coming in and speaking to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| At this time, we'll turn the meeting over to Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| and we'll begin with the ordinance amendment, item number 41 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Director's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| It actually feeds into what Commissioner Uten brought up related to ordinance amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1233)|
| 0:20:42| At last month's meeting, planning staff was asked to provide an update on the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| to the planned residential zone update that we started back in –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| actually, it was started with my predecessor committing to put it on our work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| So in fall 2020, we kicked off the planned residential zoning district review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| We had an internal committee that made up of planning staff, engineering public works staff, and the mayor's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| We convened a developer's roundtable, which meets periodically to solicit feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| We also hosted two planned residential committee meetings, which some of those of you on this body serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| And then we developed and completed a community survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| In early 2020, we hosted an additional two planned residential stakeholder committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| And then, as you all know, there's been a bit of a pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| And one of the reasons for that was we knew that we were going to be undertaking this large planning effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| and it doesn't make sense to do an overhaul of one of our most frequently used zones prior to doing the long-range plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1304)|
| 0:21:54| However, in looking back at some of the suggestions that were made during this process last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| there are some tweaks that probably could be made to clarify the zone, clear up some of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| There is some ambiguity that leads to confusion, which would be helpful for staff in terms of implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| but also help provide some additional clarity to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| So with that, our intent is to reconvene that planned residential stakeholder committee to review proposed amendments to the district by the end of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1337)|
| 0:22:28| and then review those proposed revisions with this body in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| And then in April, have it come before you for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| And then if you all want to send it forward, it would go to a county commission in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| So that is the intent right now, to try to move that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| And I'll have more information for you regarding what the details of that might be after we convene the planned residential stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1362)|
| 0:22:53| Anybody have any questions about that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I do want to recognize a few staff promotions that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| Mike Reynolds and Michelle Porche and Liz Albertson have all been promoted to principal planner over the last couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1383)|
| 0:23:11| We also have Gene, who served as our planning services manager, has left to pursue other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| And Jeff Welch has graciously offered to serve as our interim planning services manager, in addition to his role as the transportation planning manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:31| So thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| And with that, I will move to ordinance amendments now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| So item number 41 on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| This amendment is what I would call housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| So any changes to the text of the zoning ordinance require an ordinance amendment, and that's both for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| So November County Commission requested that planning commission initiate amendments to the zoning code to address changes that were made to the name of the planning commission and staff almost four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1430)|
| 0:24:02| So in 2019, that became official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| So Knox County Planning for our staff function is the name, and Knox County Planning Commission for our appointed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| And throughout the zoning code, it references the NPC, as it's formally known as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| So that's what the purpose of this ordinance amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| I'm happy to go through the history of our name change if you'd like for me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Now we'll move on to rezonings and plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Number nine has been tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| You probably haven't had a chance to look at your email yet, but that's being requested by the applicant, Robert Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| So we'll skip number nine for now and go on to number 14, which is 1E22RZ Ben Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| It's a request off Emory Road near Tazewell Pike for up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| I'll turn it over to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| This site is approximately 23 1⁄2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| It is on the south side of East Emory Road, east of Tazewell Pike in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| This area is part of a mixed-use special district in our sector plans that's referred to as Harbinson Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1508)|
| 0:25:17| It's within the parental responsibility zone for all three of the Gibbs schools, Gibbs Elementary, Middle, and High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| And the applicant is requesting to rezone from agriculture to planned residential up to 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1525)|
| 0:25:36| This is what the zoning looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| You can see at the crossroads, the CA zoning is pretty much around the intersection and a little bit down the corridor of the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:52| There is also a substantial amount of RB zoning in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| And just as a point of information about the RB zone district, that does permit consideration of densities up to 12 dwelling units an acre by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1556)|
| 0:26:10| This is what the sector plan shows for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| So this mixed-use special district, you can see hatched in purple on here, was identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| And it was noted that because of the improvements at the intersection with East Emory Road and Tazewell Pike that occurred in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:30| and then the future road improvements that are expected to widen East Emory Road, those are proposed, I think, currently for the 2030 horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:41| Also, Gibbs Middle School was completed in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| And this falls, again, within the PRZ for all three of those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| This area was shown as part of that mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| And it included these larger adjacent tracks that were currently vacant and zoned agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| because it was anticipated that these improvements in this area would lead to additional development activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| The mixed-use special district called out a need for consideration of sidewalk and greenway connectivity in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| and that sidewalks should be pursued to connect residential land uses to the schools in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| So the proposed rezoning request is consistent with the mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| which recommends medium-density residential or office as a transition to the established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| However, staff is recommending a little bit of a reduction from what the applicant is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| We're asking to approve planned residential up to nine dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| And I believe we received communication from the applicant that they accept this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:09| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Just so to be clear in my mind, I understand that whole node out there and that intersection and services and new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:23| And we had a conversation, I guess, a year or so ago about that other piece to the south of Harbison Crossroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| that I think got zoned, and there was some affordable housing conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| And I think you're going to need some affordable housing out in these communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| because that's where folks are going to want to live and then commute into work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| So I buy what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| I'm just curious that the medium density is from 6 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| So that's kind of split in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Is there any when I looked at this read all the rationale and it helps to hear you explain the commercial aspect of it and that it was planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1744)|
| 0:29:15| I just keep getting hung up on the fact that everything else around it is in such smaller density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| So it's kind of this this new footprint of increased density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| And is your assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| Completely based upon the multi use and the commercial plan that was positioned 2017 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1770)|
| 0:29:39| There, I guess, just have been multiple infrastructure investments in this area, including the road network, new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| So, you know, we felt that that was enough of a change in conditions to recommend a rezoning for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| And even though the recommendation is for up to 12 dwelling units an acre, I think since there's already all that RB zoning that's just south of there that could already be developed as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:30:05| that this provides an opportunity for an increase in residential density at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| But again, it's not as significant as up to 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| There's a piece on Southwest that's right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| I'm not seeing that correctly. It's actually planned Southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| I think it's zoned nine. It's up to nine dwelling units an acre and it is not included in this mixed use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| It actually shows up on the sector plan as low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| And that was the sector plan amendment I believe that failed back in 2019, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1838)|
| 0:30:55| Okay, now we'll move on to item number 20 Perry Smith development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| The request for rezoning and plan amendment on Tazewell Pike near Shannondale Road received a lot of comments about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| This site is approximately 12 acres. It's at the northeast corner of Tazewell Pike and Shannondale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| It is within the parental responsibility zone for Shannondale Elementary School and Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| The current plan shows this area is low density residential. The applicant is requesting an amendment to medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| They're also requesting a rezoning from the current RA low density residential zone district to RB general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:41| This is what the zoning looks like in this area. You can see that this is adjacent to the city of Knoxville city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| So you see some of the RN1 and RN3 zoning that are all within the city of Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1909)|
| 0:31:59| This area was subject to a governmental rezoning from RB to RA in 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| And it noted that the RB zoning that permitted multifamily residential was not in character with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| So it was part of a much larger area that was actually down zoned. And that was initiated by local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:26| So this is what the sector plan looks like for this area. You can see that there already is some medium density residential in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:34| However, this location shows up as low density residential. And we don't really feel that this meets the criteria for medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1954)|
| 0:32:44| It's not a transitional area between commercial and low density residential, nor is it served by transit or sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| So the criteria is not met for MDR. And although there is MDR in this area, on this particular couple of parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:33:05| the plats actually show sinkholes that have been documented. And we can see on the contour map here that shows two foot contour lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1985)|
| 0:33:16| presence of these indicated by the closed depressions that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| And again, this was noted back in the 1988 rezoning as a reason to down zone to RA from RB because of the potential adverse effects that could develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:32| if this were developed more intensely as multifamily. So because of those reasons, staff is recommending to deny the plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:46| Questions? Okay, seeing none, we'll move on to item number 23, Turner Homes, 1N22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| It also has a sector plan amendment on Andes Road south of ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| So this is in the ball camp community, west side of Andes Road, north side of Troutman Lane. It's approximately 14 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2041)|
| 0:34:12| The forthcoming shod road improvements you can see are just north of here, about 900 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| You can see the yellow line going through there. Those have not been completed yet, but they are forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| So the applicant is requesting to go from low density residential to medium density residential at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| They're also asking to rezone from agriculture to planned residential, and they're asking for a density up to seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:45| This parcel is between two areas that are zoned PR up to three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| and it's adjacent to an area that's zoned PR up to seven on the north side that is more immediately adjacent to those shod road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:35:02| And while the shod road improvements are forthcoming and that is expected to increase development activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| particularly around the intersections along the shod road corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| the existing LDR in the sector plan for this area designates this location as low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2113)|
| 0:35:23| and it allows consideration of additional density than what is there currently up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:32| So the existing sector plan designation for this area allows opportunity for additional residential development than the current agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2132)|
| 0:35:45| And although, yeah, the shod road improvements are fairly close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| this would not really be a minor extension of the medium density residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| It would bisect to low density residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| So we don't feel that the shod road improvements, again, make this more feasible for this for a higher development to medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2164)|
| 0:36:15| We don't think that there was a significant error in the plan because the MDR was recognized as being closer to the shod road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2175)|
| 0:36:26| And. See, I think. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| So staff is recommending to deny the medium density residential and we are recommending to approve planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:40| but up to five dwelling units an acre because it's consistent with the sector plan and in a range that's more compatible with the adjacent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:50| Liz is five max in the LDR, did you say? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2210)|
| 0:37:01| Any other questions? All right. Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| As we're switching the cord, we're going to turn over the next three to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Number 26 is one SB 22 seat also has a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| This is located on Hardin Valley Road and Mission Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| I've received a number of comments about this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:38| All right. Hopefully that screen will come on here. There it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| All right. So, Amy. Quick update on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| But this is a revision from a plan that was approved, I believe, in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| It had 18 lots and now they're expanding it to 26 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| And what happened is I'm going to turn off the planning case viewer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| Actually, their lot's been updated on the parcel map since this originally came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| So, this parcel here used to wrap around this lot and have a, I'm not sure how deep it was, but it was, say, 50 feet or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:32| So, it had a strip of land between this property and Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| And now this developer has purchased that piece of property, so now it does have access to Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| And they also do have a little bit more land area, therefore they can have a little bit more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| Not that they exceeded their density last time or got close to exceeding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| but the property is unplanned residential up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| Let me show you the plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| So, the original development included basically what was around the cul-de-sac road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| This is Hardin Valley Drive, a road, a cul-de-sac that came in and lots along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| You can actually see the area where the old lot line was here between the original development and Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:27| As part of this plan, they are adding one lot to the front of their development here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| and these five lots, and actually, I mean, technically there's eight new lots altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| but the main concern that we've heard from the area is the additional lots along Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:51| These will have driveway access directly to Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| If you look at the map, so Mission Hill Lane was installed when the subdivision back here, Massey Creek, was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2398)|
| 0:40:07| So, this is their entrance to their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| So, they're concerned with how this will change the entrance to their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| and also if you see that there is a boulevard section here on Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| So, when you access these lots, people will need to go around that median,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| which is not uncommon in a lot of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| As part of this review, we are asking them to basically reaffirm their variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| They had three variances last time and this will continue those variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| I guess they're asking for the same variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| There's a vertical curve variance to, I guess, reduce the K value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| so it makes it a little bit steeper of an angle coming off of Arden Valley Road up into their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| There's another vertical curve at the top of their road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| and then there's an intersection spacing variance from Mission Hill Lane to their entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:15| And this has actually gotten a little bit larger than it was last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| So, the variance is actually less than it was previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| I guess if anybody has any questions, the big change on this one is just the lots along Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| Otherwise, it hasn't changed too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| You know, I can understand this part of being able to do a U-turn there on Mission Hill Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| but what about delivery trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Could a delivery truck make that turn and get access to those properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:54| I guess, again, like I said, this happens a lot in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| There's a lot of boulevard entrances like this where you have lots on one side of the boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| I assume what the delivery truck would do would go up into the neighborhood potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| and turn around if they can't make that maneuver just in the road here itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2529)|
| 0:42:19| That would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| Find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Seems a little strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Are these the only properties that have access to Mission Hills Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| Let me go back to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| In this entrance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| They'd be the only ones that have direct access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| Obviously, once it gets up into the neighborhood itself, there are some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| but that's where the main part of the neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| That's where the main part of the neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| As part of this project around the property, there's townhouses in this northern part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| and they will have access to Mission Hill Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| but those have access to their own internal road, which then access Mission Hill Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| so it's a little bit different situation in that there's just not driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| that come off of Mission Hill Lane for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| Is there any way to incorporate a frontage road to serve those five lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| Or is it probably just too tight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| There could maybe be a shared driveway arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| where two lots next to each other share one driveway access point maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| There is a lot of right-of-way there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| so there could potentially be a shared driveway along their frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| So there's about—what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Give me one second. I might be able to tell you what the—actually, I can just do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| It's a much wider right-of-way than typical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| so the houses are going to sit pretty far back from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| So that's about 23 feet from the road surface to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| and then the houses themselves will sit another 20 feet back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| So you're looking at about 43 feet from the edge of the pavement to the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| So there's a lot of room there to do something if they're sharing driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| or doing one frontage driveway where they all come off of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| like a one-way type of a situation maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| It's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:41| Is that break in the boulevard large enough to make a U-turn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| So you don't have to go all the way to the end and come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Yeah, that's large enough for a vehicle to do a typical U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| We've got one of those right where I live, and it's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2698)|
| 0:45:06| It just isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| Yeah, it looks like the median is about 10 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| and then the lanes, I believe, are 18 feet, so there's a lot of space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:23| Okay, let's move on to item number 31, 1F22UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| This is for indoor self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| On this one, I just wanted to update you on what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2735)|
| 0:45:43| So the staff recommendation is to postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| It's not coming directly from the applicant because I haven't had communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| with the applicant at this moment since earlier in the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| So what's happened is there's been a structure built on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| which you can see in the plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| It's near the rear lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| So this is Gibbs Road down towards the bottom of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| There's no other uses on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| So there needs to be a primary use if you're going to do some kind of activity on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| So in this case, since there's not a house or some other primary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| the structure, which is basically a storage building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| is not legal unless you have some use approved like indoor storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| through the use under review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| When they constructed the building, it's only 15 feet from the rear property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| which is okay if it's an accessory structure, but it's not an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| It's the only structure on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| so it has to meet the standard setback for the rear lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| They applied for variances through the BCA after the building was constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| and the Board of Zoning Appeals denied the variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| So at this point, this plan can't be acted on by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| They would have to physically move the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| I mean, it's a permanent building, so you can't really move it technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| but they would have to show how they can come into compliance with the zoning standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| by showing a building in a new location, how access and all that kind of stuff would work around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| In the zoning ordinance, so getting back to just the use itself, the indoor storage use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| it's kind of an oddity in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| There's no definition for what that is. There's no guidance for what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| So I did find an old case, which I included in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| that there was a lawsuit regarding what indoor storage meant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| and the outcome of that was it can be used for personal storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2879)|
| 0:48:07| Really, the intent is that it's long-term storage use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| You're not supposed to go—it's not supposed to be something that you go to every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| and get things out of, in and out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| And the main concern is using it as a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| It's not supposed to be used for business purposes, for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| So anyway, you can take a look at that if you care to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| and we can answer any questions you have later on if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| But at this time, I don't have any indication that the applicant wants to move forward with this this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:41| Recommendation to postpone it for 30 days is to really give a little bit of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| see what they want to do, and if we don't hear anything over the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| then we'll have to make a decision on what to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| What was the building permit issued for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| My recollection is that it was for a single-family house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| but I would have to confirm that with the county codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| Either that or it was a unit, like a garage apartment kind of a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| where there was a unit inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| But I'd have to get back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| Was that a garage door on the side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| So it was like a machine shed allowed in an agricultural area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| So this is what's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| So you need to have a primary use, which is the big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| If this had a house on it, this would be just an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| But there's no other use on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| So, yeah, you can have a machine shed of some sort if you're living on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| to do some personal projects and such, but just to have it as its own use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| I don't think in the AgZone you'd be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| The AgZone allows some non-residential uses or agricultural uses in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| but they're usually like a use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| So it's kind of a sticky situation in this case with the building already constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:31| Okay, I see no more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| We'll move on to item number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| So another staff recommendation to postpone, so Michael will review this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| So staff is recommending postponement on this one because we don't have confirmation that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:55| adjacent property owner is, I guess, not opposed to what's being proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:51:03| So Take 5 is taking an existing retail building on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| and converting it to an oil change business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| So you can see their lot is outlined here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| It's a rectangular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| But for their business, they need to have cars come in one side of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| and exit the other side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| There's not enough space on their property to really properly do the queuing lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| that would be necessary for the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| So the queuing lanes extend onto the property to the rear, come back around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| and then you come to the back of the property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| There is some language in deeds about egress easements between these two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| but it's really unclear on how that is supposed to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| And so that's why staff were wanting to see something at least recognizing that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| adjacent property owner, which is to the west here in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| is at least not opposing this application so that they can work out those agreements later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:14| if that's what they desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| There is a driveway system that's to the rear that goes out to Young High Pike to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3137)|
| 0:52:30| And the way the easement reads, it basically says the easement is over the existing paved area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:39| so it doesn't really mention anything about the unpaved area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| There's an unpaved area between the two properties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| So the Take 5 property has access kind of wrapping around to the property to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| and then back to that rear property, so it doesn't have to use a direct access between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| So it's really unclear how that old deed, what the easement, what kind of rights they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| to modify this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| And it's about a four-foot, five-foot difference between their lot and that back drive aisle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| so there's probably going to be grading on the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| It's not just simply putting down some asphalt and some striping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| There's some potential modification that's happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| So that's what we're waiting on is the modeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Other than that, there's really no opposition from staff in regard to what they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3209)|
| 0:53:45| Okay, thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| We'll transfer over to Michelle for the last one, number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| This is a USAN review located on the southwest side of Everett Road, just southeast of Yarnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3234)|
| 0:54:12| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| So this one is located pretty far west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| You can see it's adjacent to, almost adjacent to Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| It kind of has I-40 between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| Okay, we'll take it out of this mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3266)|
| 0:54:36| Wait for it to pop back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:49| If it will pop back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:57| Try it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3297)|
| 0:55:10| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| Okay, at least we have one screen up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| So as I said before, it's pretty far out west, adjacent to I-40 and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| It's kind of a closer view up through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| You can see Farragut also extends to the east of that little ribbon of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| And an aerial view giving sort of the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| This property is, well, the original property was this shape here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| and it came through the Planning Commission in 2016 for a mixed residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| And so this part right here is currently under development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| That was approved for single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| This was approved for multifamily and assisted living back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| So once you take all phases combined, it has a dwelling density of 4.4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3359)|
| 0:56:08| And then as part of that use on review that was heard in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| this triangular portion down here was approved for 224 dwelling units for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| That plan, however, did not include the plans for this, only the density and the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| So the plans are coming before this board for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| And looking at the site plan, you can see a number of different buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| I believe it's eight different buildings over the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| The pool clubhouse area is located along the western site near Everett Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| and then there's two entrances off of Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| This one is a boulevard entry that would be the main entry here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| And looking at this site, it's really close, since the clubhouse is so close to this boundary here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| puts the pool really close to this single family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| This is 57 feet from here, and then the pool is, I want to say, 30 feet or so from this boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| So in looking at that, we reached out to the applicant to see if they'd be willing to install a 250-foot deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3426)|
| 0:57:15| type A landscaping buffer that the county typically requires between commercial and residential developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| Even though it's not typically required between multifamily and single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| we felt in this case it was justified due to that property owner being so close to the main noise generator in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| So it's not listed as a condition because it is shown on the landscaping plans already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| and this is kind of looking at where that house is compared to where that clubhouse area would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| And this is just a close-up of what's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| And then there's these additional landscaping components, which are really primarily bushes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| It's proposed to look similar to what you would find with single family in terms of pitch roof and material and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| and it's oriented where the four stories are on the back end of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| so that when you're looking at it from that single family development, you really only see the three stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| So there were some improvements that were recommended by the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| One of those was to minimize landscaping and use low height signage at the westernmost access point to protect the site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| Back into the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| One of those was to provide a minimum 300-foot spacing between the proposed western access and Yarnall Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| The third was to develop the site access points with a 300-foot corner site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| and then propose posting stop signs for the proposed site access approaches to Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| So the landscaping along Yarnall is proposed to have trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| These are situated far enough back so that cars that are sitting at this intersection waiting to turn can still have site access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| The 300-foot requirement is typically between roads, not intersections to this site, even though it is fairly dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3534)|
| 0:59:03| So the county has said that they would be okay with it as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| It's a 260-foot difference, so basically 40 feet is what would be missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| The signage and the stop signs would be worked out during the permitting process and wouldn't really be part of this review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3552)|
| 0:59:21| And the only other thing that has come up recently is the town of Farragut has reached out to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| and they're interested in getting a greenway built along Everett Road within this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| So typically, because it would be maintained by the county, the county would also need to have a say in that and agree to maintain that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| and then also the developer would have to agree to construct it. It would be a significant expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| The road classification, they are both major collectors, so because this property is also part of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| there's a potential for the greenway to not be just along this road but also along this road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| Reverse-eye view, this is kind of what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| And so the interstate is at land level. It's not raised in this portion here, but it is once you get to Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3600)|
| 1:00:09| So if the applicant were to develop that greenway space in Farragut, this Farragut property would build the greenway along here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3609)|
| 1:00:17| underneath the interstate and connect to an existing greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| Looking at the street views, there are some slope issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| You can see it's a pretty significant drop-off along through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| This is starting at the eastern portion of the site and then traveling west, so a little bit further east as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3630)|
| 1:00:42| And it kind of flattens out a little bit as you get to the single-family development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| but you can still see there is some pretty significant topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| which might make the construction of the greenway a little bit challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| And at this point, I will invite Jim Snowden to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| I'm sure that since the county would have to agree to maintain it, he's got some opinions, and we'll kind of cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3658)|
| 1:01:12| Thanks, Michelle. Yeah, the county would be willing to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| I think the frontage of this development is somewhere around between a half or a quarter and a half mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| So if the developer would be willing to construct it along that essentially quarter mile, half mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| the county would be willing to maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| But like I said, our main concern is the town of Farragut, the connection up to the trailhead parking there for their greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| Because I ran some brief numbers on it, and it would probably add about $250,000 to the developer's cost to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| So we would like to, before we apply that condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| we'd like to make sure that there was a connection that would be moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3708)|
| 1:01:58| Is it a condition to set aside right away now in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| No, right now it's just being proposed for you all to consider and discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| and if that's something you all wanted to discuss with the applicant at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| and if they agree, and since Knoxville, I mean, since Knox County has agreed to maintain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| then if the applicant agreed to build it, you all could add that condition at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| But weren't you also saying that you're looking for a confirmation from the town of Farragut to build the first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3744)|
| 1:02:33| No, they've said that they would connect the greenway along this portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| Yeah, so we were just needing to reach out to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| They did say they would connect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| So we have a call in to Farragut to confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| Jim and I reached out in advance of this meeting, so we'll follow back up after this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| and hopefully have some more information before Thursday for you all, from Farragut specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| This has all been very recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| So just to make sure I'm clear, did the applicant say that they would be willing to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| I have not had an opportunity to reach out to the applicant yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| Has the county heard from the applicant on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| We have not, Commissioner Uten, and that's probably somewhat our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| When we looked at this originally in the lens of the sidewalk ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| we primarily focused to the west because that was the county area and it's commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| and it was outside the bounds, plus that commercial wasn't really walkable commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Being that that greenway is not maintained by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| just to be honest with you, I think we kind of overlooked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| And then when the vice mayor at Farragut reached out yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| we were like, oh, it's really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| It could be argued that it's slightly outside the quarter mile that is required in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| but obviously the connection is there, so we want to try to support it if everybody is agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| So I guess conversationally, you're waiting to hear from Farragut about the trailhead connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:15| and that sort of thing because it really wouldn't make any sense to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| unless all that was going to work back towards Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| So we could require some sort of easement on the site plan and even a bond up to a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3860)|
| 1:04:31| and if Farragut hadn't done their part, then we could release the bond and go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| and the easement would be there in case somebody wanted to do it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| Correct. That's how I would like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| I just wanted to say that I appreciated your articulation of what that site had originally been looked at as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:55| with an assisted living and then single family and then the apartment complex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| It really shows how you've got these three kind of different phases of life working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| and the Greenway would be a great way to stitch it together if all parties are on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3906)|
| 1:05:21| Any other questions for Michelle or Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:30| I guess that concludes the agenda review, and we'll see everyone on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| Music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220111-agenda-review?start=3935)|
