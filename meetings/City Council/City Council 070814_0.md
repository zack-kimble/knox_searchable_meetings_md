| 0:05:31| I don't think that that's an issue in terms of that messing up anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| As far as I know, I see no one's ever talked to me about it at all, and there's no one here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=336)|

| 0:06:06| And I don't think we have any consent items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| I don't think I really have anything to report tonight due to the length of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| We will just move right through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| I don't think there's anything of great necessity yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=378)|

| 0:07:16| Any other reports from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| One, I know a lot of people feel bad about missing the ribbon-cutting for the Lonsdale Park yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| I apologize for not getting word out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| And I wanted to share the next big event in Lonsdale is going to be a public meeting on August 23rd at 5 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| at New Friendship Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| We're talking about the next step in moving forward in the redevelopment plan for Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| That should be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Also wanted to let councilmembers know, if you recall from the budget discussion last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| there was a lot of talk about salary and doing a better job on a salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| The city has got an RFQ out now, and there's a committee that's meeting to select a consultant to do that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=478)|
| 0:08:06| Hopefully, we'll have a contract ready for council to review in early September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| So I wanted to let folks know that is moving now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| A little follow-up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| We're very pleased with the number of firms that submitted qualifications in that, and hopefully we'll –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| I think the committee that has to review them isn't pleased with the number, but that's still – that's good, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Oh, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| In terms of the amount of work, we're glad to know that so many people want to bid on the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| the committee will somehow labor through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Other reports from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| We will move on to the agenda then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=520)|

| 0:09:49| We do have folks signed up to speak both for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| We'll have those who are signed up to speak in favor go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| I want to make sure I've got all the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| The folks I have signed up to speak in favor are Chris Fortune, Burt Benedict, and Sharon Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=599)|
| 0:10:10| That's correct, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| And if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| My name is Chris Fortune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| I am the proposed developer or one of the proposed developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| I live at 1613 Duncan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| And if I can, I'd like to hand out a potential or a proposed site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| You might just hand the group and let us pass around because this does count toward your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=631)|
| 0:10:44| May I go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Mr. Mayor, Councilman, the reason I'm here tonight, we are appealing a decision by MPC where we did get turned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| or denied for our rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| The meeting, the MPC meeting, I unfortunately wrote down the date wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| And I thought the meeting date was the Tuesday following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| And it was not a pretty conversation when I called in that Friday to find out the exact meeting time Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| And they told me it went the night before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| So that was a bad day for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| But what we have is 12 acres that's out on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| It's in the MPC sector plan to be a medium-density residential use site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| That's what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| It's in their plans, their future plans for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| The property is adjoining a commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| It has low-density residential to the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| There is proposed lane widening going to a four-lane road out on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| The MPC staff reviewed it thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| They took a look at everything having to do with, you know, how it's going to affect the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| to how it's going to affect the traffic counts, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| And MPC staff was fully in favor of the zoning on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| We didn't ask for anything outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| We're not going to ask for any variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| The site plan that I've given you is a very early proposal that what we think we're going to be able to put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| would be the maximum density that we think we could ever get on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Just in all, honestly, I do not believe we'll end up with that many units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| I think it's shown as 192 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| But after the ‑‑I'm sure what TDEC would have to do to us, I'm sure we'd end up losing a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| So it'll be up under what we have proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| But that would be the maximum density that we would like to see on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| We have a couple other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| We've had a meeting with the Homeowners Association with the subdivision behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| We did have some opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| I know they're going to speak after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| We've also had quite a few people that were sort of on the fence on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| They thought it might be nice, but they understood the concerns of the other homeowners, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| And so they just wanted to kind of go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| And we also have a list of, I believe, 38 folks in the neighborhood that are in favor of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| So we do have a good bunch both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| I think that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Anybody have a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Mr. Hawkins, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Mr. Fortune, you're applying for, of course, a plan amendment and rezoning from R1 to R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| Was there a reason you asked for R2 versus plan residential, RP1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| Well, I actually didn't oppose the other, the second one, the one that lets the plan go back through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=818)|
| 0:13:46| When I had my initial meeting with Ken Pruitt over at MPC, Ken suggested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| And so that's what I went ahead and went with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| And when they called me back, MPC actually, that's the zoning, the second one you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| is the one that they actually recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| And I don't have any problem with that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| You know, the plan that I've turned in to you guys and the actual apartment plan that I've shown, that is basically it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=843)|
| 0:14:13| There will be a little tweaking here or there, but basically the package is as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| And it will work in either sort of zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| And I don't have any problem whatsoever with MPC or the homeowners group, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| looking at the project that we'd like to put through on a final basis before we ever get approval on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| I realize that we're on the plan amendment first, but they go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| So that's why I went ahead and asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| So you would be okay with RP1 where there would be a further level of review versus R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| Yes, no problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| When you say the plan that you've submitted to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| So I have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Now that is the proposed actual units that we're looking at building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| And that's the actual site layout as we would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| No, we didn't spend, you know, $20,000 going through a set of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| See, that's the reason we were in favor of the second set or the second zoning is because we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| assuming we can get that zoning with the density that we'd like, then we will submit a full set of engineering drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| This is what it's going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Who did this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| That's a set of plans from, you know, a standard plan manufacturer that does multifamily properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| That's all I have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| In this, I mean, this is a fairly, like you said, fairly preliminary design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| And I understand sort of your concern about not going too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| But there's no retention pond on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Have you thought about how you're going to deal with what looks to be a pretty significant ditch that's going to carry water through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Well, as I say, I mean, everything will have to go through TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| You guys know the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| Everything has to go before the city engineering guys, has to go before the state guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Everything has to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| That's the reason I'm saying that that layout that I have proposed right there, it would absolutely be the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| My guess is, my gut feeling is, we would lose at least a couple of those buildings just because of various detention ponds and, you know, piping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=968)|
| 0:16:16| And have you done enough of the finances to know how many buildings you can lose before it's not worth building it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| No, not honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Well, I guess I'm just relating now to the dozens of phone calls and maybe more than dozens of e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=989)|
| 0:16:38| and I have tried to respond to everyone honestly because, frankly, until arriving here tonight, I had nothing to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| I hadn't heard from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| I hadn't had an opportunity to discuss the development at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| One of the questions that kept coming through the thread, that kept coming through the conversations, regarded financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1014)|
| 0:17:03| simply because of the concerns of what kind of financing you were planning on seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| And you know that has a lot to do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Well, my partner on this is Hallrob Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| Mr. Talbot, Bob Talbot, and I have another project out in Sevierville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| and we actually have several sources that we can get the financing through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| We can go locally to one of the banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| We've talked to a mortgage broker for a federal loan out of Charlotte, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1052)|
| 0:17:41| I mean, the money, if we can get the project passed, we shouldn't have any problem with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| Well, I think the question, just to cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| The question involves, will there be subsidized housing here, housing vouchers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| Right. I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| My understanding, and I have not done a lot of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| but my understanding on the HUD voucher, the KCDC voucher thing, is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| I cannot turn somebody away because of age, race, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| If they can make the payment that we have, which will be above, at or above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| any other complex in the neighborhood, then they can live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| I mean, it's the only fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| I mean, the way that KCDC stuff works is based on a certain person's income, they'll get a voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| If that voucher does not reach, say if we had an $800 rent, they get a voucher for $400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| they're responsible for the other $400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| I mean, I don't think legally I can turn away anybody to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| So it is your plan to accept those vouchers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| I don't think legally anybody in Knoxville can turn away a voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| That has nothing to do with the rentability of a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| But if you're asking me if that's my target market, then absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| That's what you're, I believe, you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| I think your occupancy changes when the vouchers come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| The, it's like I'm telling you, there can be an apartment complex out in, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| out in West Knoxville that charges $1,500 a month for a two-bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| If somebody comes in and gives them a $500 KCDC voucher and makes the other $1,000 by themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| that's their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| And it's no one else's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| I mean, I'm not going to frown on somebody because of age, race, color, income, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| If they can pay the rent on the project or if they can pay the rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| the standard rent that will be for everybody, I'm not going to have discounted rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| I mean, if that's your other question, it will be across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| It's not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| It's the question of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| And at the Homeowners Association meeting that we had the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| same question came up, and I know you've heard it a thousand times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| And I told them the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Legally, I don't think there's anybody, any apartment owner in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| that can turn away somebody with a voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| If they can make the entire rent, whatever the standard asking rent is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| then there's no one in Knoxville that can turn that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| I mean, you can have a half-million-dollar home in Sequoia Hills that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| they're charging $3,000 a month in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| If somebody comes in with a $500 KCDC voucher and makes the other $2,000, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| I don't discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| Councilman Frost, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| We'll just go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| We'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| We'll work down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Go ahead and go, Councilman Frost, and then we'll work down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| I kind of think Councilman Roddy and I were wanting to ask Mr. Nance about that since he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| He is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Mr. Nance, you've been called to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Innocent bystander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| It just seems to me that some financing requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Mr. Nance, the question I ask is, does KC, if a property owner does not contact KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1260)|
| 0:21:10| and they're not wanting to participate in the KCDC voucher program, they're not forced to do so, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1270)|
| 0:21:19| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| You have to elect to be on our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| And so my assumption has to be that you have considered that to be a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| in the manner that you intend to finance the development, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| To use KCDC or not to use KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| No, we haven't even discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| That hasn't even been a part of our proposal at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| The only time this has ever come up is at that homeowner's meeting the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Well, those were valid questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Oh, yeah, it's a valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| But, no, it hasn't come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| We never had that intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Mr. Nance, if you could come back down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| I had a follow-up question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| I think we have some gray area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| And I know Mr. Fortune is trying to characterize your organization as being very fair and wide open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| which I know that it is, but I think there's a little bit of confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| you know, the analogy that if someone has a $500 voucher but they want to rent a $2,000 a month apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| something about the math and the need in there doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| Could you address that a little bit for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Well, I would say they probably won't be on the Section 8 program if they can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| because the Section 8 voucher is based on the income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| An individual must be able to pay at least 30% of whatever income they earn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| and the vouchers are based on unit sizes and the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| So it's not a matter of whether or not we issue a voucher to cover a $2,500 apartment cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| We're issuing a voucher to cover the cost of a unit based on its number of bedroom sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| And so a client of KCDC needs to be able to take 30% of whatever income they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| and put it toward housing, and the voucher simply supplements that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Makes up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| To get them into something that is affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| That is affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Let me, if I can do a quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| If there's somebody who's wanting a Section 8 voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| or got one that wants to move into an apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| can that apartment complex not accept them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| If they have chosen not to be a part of the Section 8 program, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Counselor Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Mr. Fortune, have you done any other projects in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| I've done several condo projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| That's the main thing that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| I built a set of condos up on Tillery Road out off of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| I've got a set of condos that we're finishing up over on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| it's right across from Whittlesprings Golf Course, a 50-unit complex over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| I've got a 120-unit complex that I'm doing out in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| I've done another couple of sets out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| So that's my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Those are all condominiums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Yeah, basically all condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| I'm sorry, were you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Mr. Fortune, this site has got some real topography to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| You show on your site plan that you gave to council, you show a layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| It's very rectilinear, but it's on a very topographically challenged site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| which means you'd have to substantially regrade the site to make this plan work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Well, no, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| I've spoken with engineers about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| and the way the site would end up having to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| of course you have to work with the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Any developer in their right mind is not going to come in on a piece of property like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| and try to level it out and try to create just a solid level piece to put something on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| So basically what you have is you're going to follow the terrain as absolutely much as you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| and disturb as little as you can just because of financial constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| You don't want to go in there and try to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| So I will try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| My understanding, and I've taken this by the engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| I just haven't gotten them to completely do a layout on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| but the engineer does not seem to think it's going to be a problem whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| even with the stepping of the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| So as you're looking at the project, they will step going around the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| But you would agree that it could end up looking different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| The layout could end up looking different than this because this is essentially, you know, it's rectilinear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| It's as if it were laid out on a flat site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| And I realize that the economics might prevent grading it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| but that's always an option you would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| especially under this zoning where there are really no controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| You know, you don't have to submit a site plan other than, you know, to engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| to make sure that you meet the basic engineering requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| You're talking about the second zoning, the one that MPC recommended, or the R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Honest to goodness, as much feedback as there has been on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| I'm in complete favor of the other zoning, the one that has to go back through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| so that everybody can review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| I don't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| My point is that this ‑‑I can't imagine you doing anything on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| without dramatically impacting the site and having to do some regrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I think that's inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| And having the least impact on the site and its surroundings, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| would be one of the things that I personally would like to see happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| if we do ever approve anything other than R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| And I'm not saying we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Clearly, there will continue to be pressure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| given that this is a state highway and a major arterial that's due to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| And there will probably be pressure to, if not zone it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| there will be pressure to zone it commercially over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| And, of course, that would almost inevitably entail a major site regrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| But I just wanted to point out that I think that's a big issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| I agree with you completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| There will be a substantial amount of grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| That came up in the conversation also with the homeowners the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| But it's like I was telling them, you know, no matter what you try to do to the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| I don't care if you're going to do R1 on a site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| you're still going to have to do quite a bit of regrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| You're going to have to tear down trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| I mean, that's just the way development works on a site that has that sort of, you know, growth on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1662)|
| 0:27:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| There are other additional speakers lined up, and we will take them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| I think next is Burke Benedict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| My name is Burke Benedict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| I live at 5221 Crestwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| I represent the sellers of the property here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| My company has been marketing this property for about eight to ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Before you all sat down, I left a little blue folder up there on your desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| with some information in there about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| I know we don't have time to read all that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| but I was going to direct you to page four in there, which is a color drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| This comes from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| This is the Northwest Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| This is a current drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| There's a circle there pretty much in the center of the page that is the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| And for some time now, the planners have earmarked this area for medium-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1730)|
| 0:29:00| So whenever we took this as a marketing venture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| that's what we've been trying to do is find somebody that will develop this for that sort of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1746)|
| 0:29:16| And the most dramatically affected area, if there is one there, is Royal View Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| which I used to live on, by the way, but it's right directly behind this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| You can see a little curve right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| and there's about five or six houses that might be able or probably will be able to see these apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| However, the distance between the apartments and these units is about 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| So, and Mr. Fortune has agreed to build or erect whatever privacy, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| he'll conform to the codes and MPC directions about that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| It's not like they're going to be, you know, looking at something awful anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| This is going to be an upscale development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| There will be a clubhouse there with a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| You can see on the drawings there kind of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| But probably the most important thing that I wanted to show you was back on page 9 and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| This is a petition that we started working on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| After our meeting with the homeowners last Thursday night, we decided that we would go out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| and find out if there were any people that were in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| And in about three hours we signed up about 38 people that said they had absolutely no objection to this project of any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1835)|
| 0:30:44| That they thought that it was probably good for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| They don't like the way the property looks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| The property is unoccupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| The property is gradually running down over time because the houses are unoccupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| The houses have been vandalized since they've been empty for about three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| All the houses have been vandalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| So a lot of people said, yeah, I think you ought to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| It will help the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| So those people that signed this are property owners and they live in and around Cumberland Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| Most of the people that signed this are within less than a quarter of a mile from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| Now, the interesting thing about this is that a few of these people that signed our petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| were initially against this project because they were told that it was a low income housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| And once they found out that it was not, they were in agreement that this property should be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1894)|
| 0:31:43| So, you know, I mean, you get all kinds of reactions from people when you go and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| One guy says, you know, I'm kind of old fashioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| I think if a man wants to sell his property, he ought to be able to sell his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| You know, so you get all kinds of reactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| But I urge you all to think about the fact, too, that since this property is church owned, it is not on tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1919)|
| 0:32:09| This property is 500 yards from the population center of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| And you look at the NPC drawings, you'll see where the geographic, I mean, the population center of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| is about 500 yards down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| So we've got 12 acres there and it doesn't generate a penny of tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| So I urge you all to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| And I urge you all to think about the economic impact that this development could bring to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| as far as people shopping at the grocery store, people going to the gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| people patronizing the restaurants in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| So, and I think that TDOT, who a lot of times kind of gets a bum rap for things, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| they kind of see what the future of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| And I have drawings back here that I can show you after the meeting if you're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| But in their drawings, when they build that four lane through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| they've already designed it with a center turn lane that will service this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| And also they've even included in the plan sidewalks, which will connect this property with Cumberland Estate Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=1992)|
| 0:33:21| So the people that live in this development will be able to walk to the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| They'll be able to walk down to the cleaners and to the bank and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| That's your five minutes, sir. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I do think there's a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Councilman Bailey or Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Yeah, I guess, Mr. Benedict, I'm glad you came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| I wanted to ask a couple of things about mostly the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| My understanding is the church, when they got the property, they actually looked at the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| and then said we need to find somebody to fulfill the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| That's very correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| So they were actually doing, I'm a big fan of sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| I think we need to do a whole lot better job with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| And this is actually a case where the property owner was doing what the city, what the planners would like to have happen, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| We want it to be, this property, I have kind of a vested interest in this because this property was donated by my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| They've owned this property since 1880.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| They've paid taxes on it for over 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| They donated it to the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| The church says find us a buyer for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| You know, let's be good stewards of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Find something that will fit here, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| And I've shown this property to a lot of developers that have said, well, you know, it might go commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| but, boy, I sure hate to get into it with MPC because MPC says this should be medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| You know, it's interesting because later on the agenda we've got some things that are low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| that are commercial and MPC was fine with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| So I'm a little surprised there's that much concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| I think it's more interesting when people actually follow the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| I'm really, really glad you all did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| I'm glad you brought the page from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| It has the map on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| I forgot to bring mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| And if you look at it, this is on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| The interesting thing, this goes back to some of what Joe Holquist was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| the medium density residential is the orange on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| And if you look at this property, it's actually not orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| It's orange and green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| And this goes to someone, the green is the slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| And I'm wondering, again, looking at this, it's sort of pretending like this whole thing was orange, and it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| And I'm wondering, and this, you know, maybe it's a question for Mr. Fortune as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| but at some level, how did you all think about the topography of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| and the fact that while the sector plan says medium density residential, it also says slope protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| Did that factor into what you were doing, and how is that sort of showing up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| Because I think that is a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Well, I don't know exactly the answer to that, but I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| What I do know is that when they do widen the road, TDOT will do some feathering of the embankment there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2152)|
| 0:36:01| to make it so that it won't be such a severe slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| But as far as back on in the property, I don't know, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| I took this project, or I took this piece of property before my engineer, before I ever did anything with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| and before I wrote a contract on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| And he took a look at it, and he did not seem to think there was going to be a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Again, this is something that goes back to where if we can get the zoning on it, we go to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| we go to the engineers, and we work out any sort of differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| or comply with exactly, you know, what they want from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| I know, Mr. Benedict, you were real good about saying we're following the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Since the sector plan has both orange and green, it's both medium-density residential and slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| did you all have conversations with MPC about what that meant and how that would play out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| No, I have not talked to him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| But as he has said, you know, as Chris has said, he's very amiable to any ideas that anybody may have, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Next on the agenda is Sharon Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Sharon is going to let one of the neighborhood residents speak in her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| If you'd give us your name and address, sir, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| I won't need that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| My name is Jack McCusker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| I live 46808 Royal View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I've been there about 12 years, which is directly behind where the project will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| I walked that plot last night, and it looks like Beirut in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| It's already been vandalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| People have already started dumping in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| And it's an avenue that people we don't want on our street can use to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| There are three unoccupied buildings which people have already camped out in from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| So I think any project that begins soon that removes the current threat to our subdivision is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| And from everything I've seen about this project, I really don't see a problem with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| and I see it possibly as a cure to a potential danger with what is currently an abandoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| with buildings that can be used for transients and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| I know we're all neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| We're going to disagree, but we'll still be neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| So, yes, remind me again where you reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| 4608 Royal View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| So that would be in relation to Palmetto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| That would be up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| Up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I made my little site visit, but that's the only way I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| There's a TVA power grid that runs down behind the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I'm right along that power grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| You're just off the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| You're off the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| But he does not abut these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| No, he does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| He's about one lot away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Signed up to speak against are Tiffany McMahon, Joe Peterson, and Charles Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| And we'll take them in that order unless you all want to go a different order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Go ahead if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Yes, I'm Joe Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I live at 4524 Royal View Drive, and that's one of the, I'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| lots that backs up to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| First of all, I'd like to pass around a petition with 180 names on it that are against the rezoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2358)|
| 0:39:27| And I'd also like to ask everyone from Cumberland Estates who's against this to please stand and say hello to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2367)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| What I'd like to do is talk about the impact of these apartments on the Cumberland Estates neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| First of all, we see traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| MPC projects 1,800 trips a day out of this particular subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| The developer sees one entrance and exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| We already have traffic problems in the Cumberland Estates area due to apartments that are east of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| and then the traffic light in the Cumberland Estates area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| We have traffic backed up both ways due to the red lights over the hill in the county going west or in the mornings at 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2407)|
| 0:40:17| So we've already got our share of traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| And while four-laning might decrease some of those over time, that's a long-term project it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2420)|
| 0:40:28| The schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| MPC projects that there would be approximately 35 children that would become residents of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2429)|
| 0:40:39| That area is zoned to Pleasant Ridge School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Pleasant Ridge School, according to my conversations with their administrators, is at capacity now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| In order to accommodate 35 people at Pleasant Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| they would have to add more outbuildings, and there is no space for the temporary outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| That would also put their enrollment at approximately 400 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| which, according to county policy, means that they would have to add a second full-time bookkeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| So there are economic costs to adding this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| When our developers talked about the economic benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| I don't know if all these people are going to be coming from someplace else, some other county, some other state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| but I would project that most people who would move in there already live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| So the net gain as far as sales taxes, things like that, is probably close to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2485)|
| 0:41:41| I guess also when we talk with the school administrators and when I've talked with former teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| and I mentioned to them that the possibility of adding an apartment complex of this size in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| most of them had a negative attitude towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| They felt like the children who come from apartment backgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| the transient state of that environment are much harder to educate, harder to manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| and they felt like there would be a negative impact on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| Pleasant Ridge School is already getting lots of transfers in from the Norwood area due to the No Child Left Behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| So Norwood or Pleasant Ridge is probably going to be overcapacity for some period of time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2539)|
| 0:42:28| I guess as residents we feel like our property values are going to be negatively impacted by having apartments so close to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2548)|
| 0:42:36| And I think that was borne out in our meeting with the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| When we asked them what benefits do you see that we, as current residents of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| would get from having apartments next to us, there really wasn't a statement of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| It's really just, and I'm paraphrasing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| they said this development is better than subsidized or low income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| So that was kind of the alternative they proposed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And so it seems clear that the real estate professionals see no value added to the current residents of Cumberland Estates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| from adding this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| One more minute, Mr. Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| I guess as residents of Cumberland Estates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| we feel like that we have a contract with the city to maintain our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| and maintain the zoning within those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| And so, therefore, we would ask you to maintain that contract that people have come into the Cumberland Estates area more recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| with the expectation that it's going to be a community of single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| And we'd really like to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| We're not opposed to development of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| We'd like to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| We don't feel like apartments are the best way to enhance the value of this community for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| So that's all I've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Councilman Whitelm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Actually, this question is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| When Mr. Fortune is conferring with MPC about schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| MPC says there's not going to be any impact on schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| And yet when Mr. Peterson does a little research, there clearly is going to be an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| So how is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| Well, we didn't say there wouldn't be any impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| We estimate the number of projected student age population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| And then when we do that, we issue a whole set of disclaimers that it's hard to predict where they're all going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2672)|
| 0:44:40| And they come in at various states of their education careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| And every year, a school like Pleasant Ridge has to replace a graduating class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| So there is change all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| People are moving in and out of neighborhoods all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| So with an estimated impact of 35 students, a school the size of Pleasant Ridge, some of those are going to be high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2699)|
| 0:45:11| Some are going to be middle school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Some will go home school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Some will go to private school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| The impact probably will be minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| So even after hearing tonight, you still think that the impact will be minimal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Generally, except for the west part of the county, school enrollments are projected to be dropping in a lot of the schools that are within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2728)|
| 0:45:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Mr. Peterson, I know that you can't speak for the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| But in your opinion, you know, you mentioned that you didn't feel that this was the best use for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| Assuming that this piece of property is developed somehow in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| what would you see as being a use that would be complementary to the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| I think speaking for the residents, or at least in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| I think we'd rather have owners of property rather than leasers or renters of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| We'd rather have permanent residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| And by permanent residents, we could see condominiums there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| I think we could see professional office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I think those would both enhance the neighborhood as opposed to, I'll say, the non-permanent apartment dwellers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| So an office designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| which this council has frequently approved on rezoning as a transition between a residential area and more commercial areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| you could see an office area as being workable with your neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| I certainly could, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| I think next is Tiffany McMahon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2806)|
| 0:46:55| My name is Tiffany McMahon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| 4404 Deerfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| That's the second street over from the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| I live there with my husband and my 5-year-old daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| I'm the fourth generation to have owned property in Cumberland Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| And my daughter now is the fifth generation to live within the Cumberland Estates community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| The problem with this development, just to name a few, is the environmental impacts that it will have on Third Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| And Third Creek has already had its share of problems throughout the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2847)|
| 0:47:35| The traffic problems that we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| There's, of course, plans to make this four-lane, but it's not four-lane today, nor will it be tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| The retention pond that would have to be built for this big a property would cause more insect problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| And what we would like to see for this property is to promote more positive growth to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| And we don't think that this plan that he has for this development would promote more positive growth for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| We work hard to keep our sense of community, to preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| And I don't think that this apartment complex moving in would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| And I think the MPC had it right when they denied it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| This is the wrong development for our property and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| And we hope that U.S. City Council makes the right choice for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Charles Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Give us your name and address and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| Thank you, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| My name is Charles Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Excuse me, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| And if this isn't appropriate, you can tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| But I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| The young lady who just spoke made a comment, and I just wanted Mr. King to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| Would that be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| If you'd like to do that, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Go ahead, Ms. Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| She was making a comment regarding Third Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| And that is an issue that has come up in many conversations we've all had, I think, with the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| Can you respond to their concerns about how this would impact Third Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| Well, I can respond in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Many of our streams within the city are what we call impaired as far as water quality is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| And we address the water quality in our permit with TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| And there are certain things that must be done during construction and after construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| to try to minimize the impact on the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| We currently have TMDLs, or total maximum daily loads, for such things as sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| And in the future, we'll have limitations on other pollutants that enter our stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| So we will be monitoring all developments to ensure the water quality of our streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=2998)|
| 0:50:07| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Sir, if you'd resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Could you start my time over, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| I will start your time over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| You're not a lawyer by chance, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Oh, I'm pro bono tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| Thank you, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| My name is Charles Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| I live at 4528 Royal View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| My property is immediately adjacent to the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| We're still opposed to any zoning change or any amendment to the plan that's been discussed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| And let me straighten out a few things that's been said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| The staff, Mr. Fortune, said the staff recommended R2 be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| It's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| They recommended R2 be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| It's in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| You've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Also, a lot of mention has been about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| Well, according to this report here from the Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| it says the present plan designation zoning is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| That's known as R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| And so medium density is what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| That's not what he's got now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| What we're asking is to not amend that plan from low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3081)|
| 0:51:31| On Thursday last, we met with the developer, and upon my questioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| he told me that he was essentially going to clear cut the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| But I believe he told you he was going to save some trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Now, you either believe him now or what he said later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| I do believe he's going to have to clear cut the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| And also, the question was raised about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| or not how much money he was going to get for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| And you heard from Mr. Nance that once you accept a voucher, you've got to accept them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| If you can, refuse them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| But think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| If you had $3 million worth of apartments and you had half of them rented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| you're not going to turn down low-rent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| And after this is approved and he gets to build the apartments, he can do anything he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| We can't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| It was mentioned that this property doesn't generate taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| You've got a map there, plot number 39, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| There are seven plots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| I'll just tell you about one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| It's plot 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| It's been owned by the church since September the 8th, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| Last year, 2007, it paid $940.50 taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3175)|
| 0:53:04| The city got $480.51 of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| So they do pay taxes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| So now I'll get to my ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| Oh, and one speaker said that his property was adjacent to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| He's not adjacent to the property on Royal View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| He is, like somebody said, one property away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| He didn't get the notices and so he wasn't affected by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| But we feel like these apartments are not a good mix for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| I was told not to say mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I should not have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| We feel that the proposed apartments are not the right development in a community of single-family homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| And MPC has already agreed with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| We want the property to stay R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| It's never been fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| There are three residences that's been testified to and they're vacant right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| They've been vandalized because they've been vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Nobody's been around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| They're up in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| But this has never been developed for good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| I believe it's because of the cost of tree and stump removal and to reshape the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3253)|
| 0:54:22| Sixteen apartment buildings makes a big footprint on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| And the developer has told us at the meeting that he would have to clear cut the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| and make tiers so that he could shape it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| He said he spoke to his engineer, but when we talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| he told me that that plan that he handed out to you is the same thing he handed out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| It's a hand-drawn plan, not to scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| although he told me a scale was one inch equal 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| That's the scale for all city plat maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| And there's a huge ravine at the upper end or the northwest side of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| It runs on the eastern side of the property, a huge ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| It runs for several hundred feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| Now, 30 more seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| It's, well, 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Changing the course of stormwater down through that ravine by reshaping the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| will bring unintended consequences upon the developer, a builder, and ultimately to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| So, in Cumberland States, there's a 61-year-old community that is R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| with 700-plus single family homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| And we ask you to preserve the integrity of the community and deny the appeal, Mr. Fortune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| Also, the ordinance is 12T and 12U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Mr. Fortune, by council rules, you have a chance to have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Councilman Becker or Councilman Bailão.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| Councilman Bailão, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Mr. Donaldson, would you just walk me and some of us through this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| The one-year plan proposes low-density residential uses for this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| and the northwest city sector plan proposes medium-density residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Those two plans are in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| The one-year plan is a charter provision that was to provide an action plan for rezonings, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3385)|
| 0:56:37| during each current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| I think over time, planning staff has followed a provision in that charter paragraph that says that the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3400)|
| 0:56:49| shall provide the basis for zoning of all properties with the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| and have made the one-year plan reflect the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| Since the current zoning is R1, they have made the one-year plan read low-density residential because those two correspond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3421)|
| 0:57:10| However, when you look at the bigger picture with the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| which is a part of our comprehensive plan, along that particular corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| we have designated that as medium-density residential, which is a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| Mr. Swanson, would you help me with his answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| Because, you know, I'm always trying to, I mean, I'm conflicted on this because I've always tried to support property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| and I want to follow the sector planning, and those are all good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| But, you know, when I drove over there today, you go into Cumberland Estates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| it's clearly, you know, that those neighbors have rightful concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| Then when you go down on Western Avenue, some of the comments earlier is there's three homes down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| they're vacated, they've been vandalized, they're overgrown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| If that had been kept up and if it were cleaned up, it's residential, clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| And they said three, four months ago those places were vacated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| Well, you know, you get sort of a false sense of what that area is when you look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| because it's just overgrown and it's, but there's homes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| You know, three, four months ago there were people living in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| So I'm, you know, I look at the property rights issue and the compatibility issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| and the quality of life issues and those things that affect the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| And then I want to look at these two plans, and I see a one-year plan, low-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| and the sector plan, medium-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| So help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| I'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| The sector plan is a long-term aspirational plan that's been developed by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3536)|
| 0:59:05| and approved by the city council that says, in long-term use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| this is where, in our view as professional planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| and as planning commission charged with the responsibility for making determinations in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| which way your planning ought to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| This is all, in our long-term view, where this property ought to be headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Our one-year plan is not aspirational in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| It is, in fact, mandatory in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| You may not zone property inconsistent with the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| which is why you have in this instance before you an ordinance to modify that one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3579)|
| 0:59:48| in advance of your consideration of a rezoning of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| because you may not, under the city charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| rezone property in a fashion which is inconsistent with the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| Now, in the optimal scheme of things where other policies and whatnot don't come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3601)|
| 1:00:10| and everybody gets it right the first time, which is very difficult to do and almost impossible to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| but assuming that everybody gets it right the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| if you've got a sector plan that's inconsistent with a one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| what you assume is going to be happening is that as time moves along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| that one-year plan is going to come into conformity, going to be modified as time goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| to come into conformity with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| Sometimes that happens and sometimes that doesn't happen, as a realistic thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| because of differences in the way property develops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| and the way property surrounding that property develops and the realities of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| So I don't know if I've helped you at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| but I think what you've got to say here is that in terms of the professional planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3658)|
| 1:01:06| they believe that long-term, a medium-density residential use is probably where this particular area of property ought to be headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3666)|
| 1:01:15| But at this moment, the legal plan is a low-density residential plan and has not yet evolved to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3675)|
| 1:01:27| And it's up to you to decide whether or not it actually should evolve to that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| That's why you get elected to make these easy calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| That helps me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Councilman Becker, and then I'll come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Actually, thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| I had some real similar questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| And I guess I have a question sort of of what should happen either for you or Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| At some level, we adopted the Northwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| I think it was our first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| My first meeting as a councilman, so it was December of 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| And, Mr. Swanson, I sort of hear you saying that ideally what should have happened is sometime between that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| when the sector plan said this should be medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| and the point at which somebody comes in and wants a zoning change, there should be a change in the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| And part of what seems to happen is we do that point, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| 35 seconds before we do the change in the zoning rather than a year in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| So we get a debate that's a little different than maybe we ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| Does that make a little sense to folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| I mean, it sounds like there should have been another discussion at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| another vote of council about what is the future of this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| And I don't know if I'm off base on that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| Well, according to the charter, there has to be a rational nexus between the one-year plan and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3758)|
| 1:02:46| So in the absence of a general rezoning to comply with the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| we have to do the one-year plan piecemeal as properties come in for zoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| At some level, the sector plan was done four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| So we do these every seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| So this sector plan will be done in another three years, maybe two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| Greg, the folks that live in Cumberland Estates that want to know what's happening with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| how should they stay on top of this for the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| What's the way to be involved in that process and not be in this situation again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| Well, when we initiate a sector plan within the city, we go through a very, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| an extensive public participation process where we reach out specifically to neighborhood organizations that we know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3811)|
| 1:03:42| and specific interests that we know about in the particular sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| And in addition to that, do general public notices about the areas that we're studying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| We'll have two or three or four public meetings within that sector during the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3835)|
| 1:04:03| So stay tuned and make sure that your neighborhood organization, if it is organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| is logged on with our directory and updated so that we have the correct information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3849)|
| 1:04:17| And let me ñ I noticed on the map that actually the other side of Western Avenue is a different sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| Do you know when that plan will be coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| That's probably the West City sector, which is in the pipeline right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| I think we have it on the agenda at MPC next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| So at this moment, there are actually discussions about what's happening across the street from this property that the folks in this subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3875)|
| 1:04:43| these neighborhood folks ought to have been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Can be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Mr. Nance wanted to follow up on something that Mr. Roach said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Hypothetically speaking, if you have ten units and you only wanted to have five units available for Section 8 housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3894)|
| 1:05:04| you can limit it to a certain number of units just because you take one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| They don't have to be all that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Mr. Roach, I think the question is for Mr. Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| It's for Mr. Nance, but I can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| That is correct, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Yeah, I'd like to follow up on Councilman Bailey's question and Mr. Swanson's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| Whether or not you agree that this particular development plan is right for this piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| in my mind, the recommendations that come to us from MPC per the sector plan and the one-year plan are perfectly logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3932)|
| 1:05:42| in that it's following that understanding that you can't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| You're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| They recommended not to change the sector plan to stay with the, let's see if I can get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| with a low-density residential plan usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| but per the big picture of trying to get to a more medium residential usage on the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3961)|
| 1:06:10| the staff recommended RP1, which is kind of easing into a more medium-density usage rather than a single-family usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3970)|
| 1:06:20| So I don't know whether I explained that well enough or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| I'm not sure I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| But to me, what MPC gave us is logical underneath how these plans are supposed to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| in that they recommended against changing the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| but what they recommended for the zoning is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| Clear as mud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Because they turned down both the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| I mean, the recommendation of MPC is low-density residential and R1, not RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| I think the staff did recommend a change in the one-year plan to MDR, medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| is what I'm reading in my section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| With regards to the one-year plan, they recommended medium-density residential designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| and then with regard to zoning itself, they recommended RP1 at a density of up to 16 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| Then I misspoke staff versus commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| Then what commission sent us, commission turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Commission simply turned it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Turned down medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Lifted where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| But if you read the minutes of commission's discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| they turned down medium-density residential with the express intent of approving RP1 on the zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| thinking that those two pieces would then work hand-in-hand to get you where you were supposed to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| underneath the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Now, I may have misinterpreted their action, but in reading the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| there is a discussion and a motion made about how do we get there from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| and to do that, they turned down the medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| but then they recommended the rezoning to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| I think they actually voted and denied the R2 zoning designation and didn't act on the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| They didn't act on the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| But I think that reason was rather unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| and I think it was because the applicant did not appear to discuss the development with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Am I correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| No, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| That's my understanding of why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| I think that may have been a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| It certainly wasn't an argument for the zoning request at our meeting other than the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| No, I just noticed that the comment there was pass it on to council and let them deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Well, I don't think I even have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| I'm going to hold that question until later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| Mr. Roach, you, for a second, you looked like you were going to explode wanting to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| You've calmed down a little, which is always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| So if you want to gently say what you were going to say before, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| I want to clear up the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| The reason that the councilwoman said the petition was denied 13-0 was that the petitioner wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4154)|
| 1:09:24| I want to point out to you that's an opinion, not a fact, you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| I was just reading from the minutes of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Well, the minutes are presenting a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Well, you know, I guess I've probably been involved in this more than any of the other members up here have been in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| And the overwhelming consensus of things that I've heard from the residents in Cumberland Estates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| is that they don't think that an apartment complex is consistent with their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| And I have a tendency to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| I mean, if you look at Western Avenue right there, this piece of property adjoins a piece of property, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| that's probably industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| It's a mini storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| And then there's a funeral home, and then there's Cumberland Estates Shopping Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| which I think would be more appropriate use down through there for a zoning, like Mr. Peterson suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| of office or maybe some type of commercial down in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| And some of the residents that I've talked to and actually have mentioned it to are actually for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| You know, I don't want to try to stop the church from selling this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| And I don't think they are stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| They can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Mr. Fortune can buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| They can buy it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| No matter what we do tonight, he can still purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| You know, and I just feel like that a multifamily development there is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| They're on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| We've heard a lot of talk about what TDOT is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| I've lived out in that community for over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| And ever since I've moved there, they've been going wide in Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| And it hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| So I don't have any of these misconceptions that that's going to happen any time real soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| It may, and I hope it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| But I don't think we can count on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| And I know we're on, right now we're on the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| And I'm going to make a motion to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| We actually, I think, by rules, I think, well, I guess you can make that motion any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| But the people speaking in favor do have a chance to come back up and speak for two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| But there is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| Would the council before the discussion like to have the, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Those in favor, Mr. Fortune, you have a chance to have a two-minute response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| Mr. Mayor, Council, I've been in development for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| And I've seen how you guys have voted on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| And I believe it follows certain rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| I mean, you have low-density residential, which is clearly low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| You have commercial areas that are clearly commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| And then you have to stage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| I mean, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| It seems like a pretty simple thing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| The property just to the east of this is a commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| And, you know, it's always been my experience that a good use of a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| if you're trying to phase it going from a commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| and I've heard the arguments for, you know, this property wouldn't be a bad commercial piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| You know, it conflicts with what they're saying on the, you know, how much it's going to impact the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| I mean, if you've got a commercial zone over there, you've got businesses that can stay open until three in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| You've got lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| You've got more traffic woes or at least as much traffic woes as you're going to have out of a multifamily project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| So a lot of the arguments that they're throwing up, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| they're going to have the same argument against what they've just said that they would like to see over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| So you have my word as developer and you have my partner's word as developer that we are planning on owning this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4393)|
| 1:13:21| We're going to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| We're going to manage it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| We're going to upkeep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| We're not going to let it fall into any sort of disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| We're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| We've got too long of a road to go in Knoxville to have a blemish on our name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| I mean, I'm, you know, I'm in my 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| I'm planning on being here for the rest of my life as far as I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| And I will probably be developing all the way until, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| somebody kicks me out and decides I can't make any more good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| So the only way that I'm going to be able to do that and enjoy success is by telling you guys exactly what I'm planning on doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4428)|
| 1:13:57| and standing behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| And this is going to be a nice project, assuming you guys let it go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| And the neighborhood will be proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| We will keep it up and it will be a good tax base, be a good, just be a good project for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Back to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| Actually, you just get one person to have a two-minute reply by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| I think that's the way the rules work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| One per side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Only the person speaking in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| They're the only ones by council rules that get the two-minute reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| We're going to go on to council discussion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| I'm going to go to Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| Old life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Just go ahead, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| Well, for those people that have tried to contact me, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| I was out of town until early yesterday morning, so I was having a difficulty getting caught up before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| So if I didn't get back to you, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| I think this is a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| I appreciate what Councilman Hall is saying, and I think I tend to agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| I think that this property will change use from its present use at some time, given the market realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| It's my understanding that the present owner perhaps made some assumptions on the resale of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4507)|
| 1:15:17| and is under some pressure, and I can appreciate that, having made some other financial decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| But I don't think that should be the governing factor in this body's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4523)|
| 1:15:31| I can see a place where it might be appropriate to put multifamily residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| and medium-density residential use on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| and I would consider going with RP1 under some circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4541)|
| 1:15:51| And also, I don't know Mr. Fortune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| I'm sure he is a man of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| I would assume that until I know otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| I do know Mr. Talbot and Hull Rob and have great appreciation for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| and for his business and the good work that they do in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| I'm really torn on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| I think it's unrealistic for folks that live in Cumberland Estates to assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| One of the things I was able to read, I think, every e-mail that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| I finally was able to catch up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Some of the folks that oppose the rezoning said they wanted it to stay pretty much as it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| with the forested slopes and all that, and I don't think we're in a position to guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| I would like it if we could have perhaps some more control over that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| but our present zoning ordinances don't really allow for much of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| RP1 might get us closer than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| But, you know, I just am really torn on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| I can see where it's possible to make something work with multifamily residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| I'm not sure if the case has been made, and I am certainly not comfortable approving R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| So my tendency is to go with Mr. Hull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| although I'd like to hear what the other members have to say first because I'm really kind of torn on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| I guess I have a comment to make, but actually a question for Mr. Donaldson first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| The sector plan actually is both orange and green on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| It's medium-density residential and slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| When we get to the level that we're at now of one-year plans and zoning, what does the green on that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| What does it mean that somebody looked at this and said there's slope protection here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| The slope protection area comes into play when we look at a planned residential district, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| and we have a site plan in front of us, and we can see the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| We use it to test whether there has been an effort made to preserve the slopes in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| and we also use it to set the maximum density within a planned residential district as compared to what the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4684)|
| 1:18:15| and designation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Medium-density residential allows up to 24 units per acre, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| If an area has a lot of slope on it, we will back that off according to a formula that we use to come up with a recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4703)|
| 1:18:33| So, in effect, if this was medium-density residential, somebody would come in and apply for a zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| and you all would say, well, yes, you can have 20 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| but you've really only got two acres in this whole 10-acre tract that are buildable, so you get 40 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| That kind of simplifying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| All right, that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| I guess I look at this, and I see the proposal here, and especially this map as just not a particularly good way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4733)|
| 1:19:03| It seems to completely miss the geography and even any kind of connection with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| But I'm real concerned about the fact that we sat back here in December of 2003 and said, by a vote of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4749)|
| 1:19:19| that we wanted this property to develop into medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| And the property owner looked at that and said, I'm going to go out and find a developer that will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| And I have some real problems of coming back now and saying, that's the wrong way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| I think we need to encourage folks to move more on following our sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4772)|
| 1:19:40| I think there are a lot of problems with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| I definitely don't feel comfortable with the R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| I'm not even sure I feel good at RP1 at this level, given how the topography works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| But I think on the one-year plan, I feel inclined to say we should allow this to be medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4790)|
| 1:20:00| Councilwoman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| This has been an extremely difficult decision to make, and I don't even know I've made my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4803)|
| 1:20:13| But I just need to talk out loud just for a minute and tell you what's been on my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| in which I've been extremely up front with the people that I have talked with on the phone and communicated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4817)|
| 1:20:28| Made that site visit, did not walk the property, just really didn't look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| It was very hot, didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| But, you know, in making that site visit, I just saw so many things there that I think MPC in their sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4836)|
| 1:20:46| has seen the changing, the transition in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| I've certainly seen it in many other parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| I guess, you know, I have to relate it to my own personal experiences because that's what I feel comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| and what I've experienced and where I've seen things work out and seen them be or not work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| And for many years, the neighborhood in which I live, which is a neighborhood just about the same age as your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4868)|
| 1:21:15| was just very opposed to any change, any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| We were well known for that position and just extremely negative on anything that would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| And then we began to have the opportunity to consider how we wanted our neighborhood to look 20, 30 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4886)|
| 1:21:36| We had a lot of property that ringed our neighborhood, some that was within the core of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| And so it became extremely important to, I'll just say to West Hills, to take a very proactive part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4903)|
| 1:21:55| in trying to see how the area was going to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| We know the area is going to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| You know this property is going to change in ownership, change in its appearance and its use over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4921)|
| 1:22:10| And so we began to, in our neighborhood, decide what we felt was best for us, what we felt was best for the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4930)|
| 1:22:20| And then that just really drew our neighborhood together and we began to be able to be positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| instead of constantly waging war against everybody that came in to, we thought, destroy our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4946)|
| 1:22:35| It has proven to be a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| A very positive thing for the neighbors, a very positive thing for the neighborhood itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| And I think a positive thing for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| And we're continuing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| We have a huge tract of land, just told the mayor today, that is just getting ready to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| I'm sure it will be to everyone's total shock because it's a tract of land that we have fought development on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| But you have to pick your poison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| And we have an opportunity to be very involved with this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| And that's what we decided was the best way for us to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| Now, I have the same problems that my colleagues do with this little piece of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| because it just doesn't tell me anything in relationship to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| because I know that this plan is not going to be what's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| But in driving the neighborhood and in then looking down on this area on Western, I can understand your perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5007)|
| 1:23:39| I understand your concern about how it's going to change your outlook toward the outside world and out of your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| But when I drive down on Western, I have to be very realistic, as Wes Tills had to be realistic, on how things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5027)|
| 1:23:56| When Middlebrook did four-lane and when we were faced with much cut-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| and many things that were really impacting us, and we began to really appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5042)|
| 1:24:10| and I have to say this was not what we appreciated initially, the apartment developments that ring Wes Tills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5050)|
| 1:24:18| It's been a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| It's a transitional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| It has been a buffer between us and the commercial, which is something we just can't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| But the apartment developments were something we could be involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| and be very proactively involved with the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| I mean, I just see this as an area on Western that needs a rebirth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| The properties are vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| The buildings just sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| They are subject to use that would be very disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| And I think very devaluing to Cumberland Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| So I'm just going to tell you, I'm very conflicted because I see your faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| I'm about the same age as most of you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| And I know how long I've lived in my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| I know how important it is to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| But times do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| The areas around our neighborhoods change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| And, honestly, we have to be flexible to try to find the very best that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| for what is going to continue our values to be as good as they are or even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| And what it has proven to Wes Tills is that young families are now coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| They are restoring the homes that are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| And it is really, I mean, it's worked out to be a positive is all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| And when I look at this, I'm really concerned about Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| I'm concerned about where it appears to be going or not going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| And I just cannot think of anything that I would feel comfortable rezoning that property for other than apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5147)|
| 1:25:59| And I have never met this young man, have been a little bit frustrated because I haven't heard from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| haven't had been involved at all until here we are looking how much time we've spent tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| because we just came in on this at the decision-making time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| And that isn't the best way for these things to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| But I'm going to have to make a decision one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| And I'm inclined to really feel that this is a positive move for Cumberland Estates, for the adjacent areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5184)|
| 1:26:34| I really think that a very well-done, well-maintained apartment development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5194)|
| 1:26:43| is going to bring other ancillary businesses that are needed for a community to be viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5203)|
| 1:26:53| and remain what you want your community to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| So I just have to explain to you at that length in order to tell you that that is as I see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| after being involved almost 40 years now in community development in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| I would like to go on and comment, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| I am concerned with the medium density designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| I would like to see this RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| I really think the community deserves, and I think council deserves, knowing that this is going to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| And I think that that will achieve a comfort level for these people that otherwise they can never have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5251)|
| 1:27:38| Because they know it will be coming back for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| They will know they will have another opportunity to interact with this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| and to try to really carve out their future for that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| and to me, I see that as council's obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Councilwoman Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Mr. Donaldson, forgive me for not knowing the answer to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| However, if council would approve the appeal for medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5287)|
| 1:28:16| but felt that the RP1 zone was preferable because of the plan coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| and there being more interaction with the neighborhood and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| can RP1 go with MDR in the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| I think it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Based on that, I guess I would agree with Councilman Becker that I think there needs to be greater accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| to our citizens with what we pass as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| and what the Metropolitan Planning Commission spends untold hours developing these sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| I think there needs to be some integration in the decision making underneath those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| However, I also agree with Mrs. Pelow that the RP1 is preferable in a case like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5340)|
| 1:29:10| because it does allow for more interaction in terms of approval of the plans by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| and input from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| So my intent tonight is to approve the appeal to grant the medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| because that is, I think, long term what we see in the plan as being appropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5364)|
| 1:29:32| But on the zoning, I can't approve the appeal for the R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| because I think the RP1 is going to give a greater level of input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| and control into the quality and what goes into this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Well, I think Councilman Roddy reflected in large part what I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| and also Councilman Pelow in going back to what Councilman Becker said about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| And I think essentially we don't have, from a parliamentary standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| we don't have to divide the question because it's already been divided for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| We deal with these issues separately as they are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| And so I tend to fall, I think, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| after thinking about it and hearing the other discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| with essentially what Councilman Roddy is suggesting and approving the change to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| And then I had asked Mr. Swanson earlier about that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| whether or not we could go to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| He said we can up to what they considered, which was 16 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| because that's what was before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| And it does not have to go back to MPC in order to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| What I would say beyond that, though, is this is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| If we do, if council were to choose to go with that approach tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| then what that would do is that would throw it back to the developer, the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| and, of course, this council to sort of reengage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| And we can hear it, we would hear it again in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| unless we chose to postpone for a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| And I would have no problem, and I know it has to go on the agenda in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| but we have done this before where we have said, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| we know it's got to come back technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| but we're going to go ahead and have a consensus that we'll actually go postpone at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| so that it will be four weeks from the night of first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| I'm just throwing that out as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Council may not be interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| But I guess where I'm going with that is given the level of concern by the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| I think it's only fair to them to give them the opportunity to really think through this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| And I'm not sure that two weeks is enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| even though there is another step with planned residential because it goes use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| And while it does not automatically come to this council, for those of you who are not familiar with the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| any use on review can be appealed to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| So it can, in fact, come back to us if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| So I would say that that's where I think I'm coming down with that understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| and my preference would be to not hear it again in two weeks, but in four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| so that everybody has a chance to really hash through this a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| Just a clarification, Mr. Swanson, if you'll answer this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| When someone requests a one-year plan amendment, they don't have to show a project, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5556)|
| 1:32:44| I mean, a property owner could come forward and apply for an amendment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| It's not like a concept plan or a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| Well, you know, as I look at this, and as you said earlier, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| that this is where that's what we get elected for and it's our judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| and I look at the transitioning that the NPC has looked for here from low density to medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5586)|
| 1:33:16| And as I look at this project, and I was out there today, and professionally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| when you go out there and you look at a ravine that's just a gully washer that goes right down the middle of these units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| and are going to end up down here in the volleyball court next to a swimming pool, it just doesn't pass the sniff test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5610)|
| 1:33:38| I mean, it just really doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| And that's, I'm sure, and, you know, in dealing, and I haven't seen anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| or heard from anybody except for the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| And so when I look at this first step and I think about property values and quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| and really what might go on in there, I think my judgment in this case is to leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| It's not time to transition to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| So I'm going to vote to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| Three quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| I guess one, Mr. Holquist, you talked a lot about the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| My inclination would be to say if we do pass the sector, the one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5657)|
| 1:34:25| I want to put off the zoning discussion until I have more information from the developer, even at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| I don't feel good about that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| I wanted to ask two questions of Mr. Swanson on technical matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| One is, Mr. Holquist said that if this is an RP1, that that plan could be appealed back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| And I know there have been some law changes recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| RP1 requires a plan to go to MPC and that that's appealable to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| Is that still the case or is that something that is no longer in our hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| Want me to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| The USUN review of the development plan is a part of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| Those decisions are appealable to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| Good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| And the second question is there is an even number of us up here at the table today because Mr. Brown isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| Could you just refresh our minds on what that means for voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| Should there be a 4-4 tie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| The mayor may vote should he choose to vote, but he is not required to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| If it is a 4-4 tie and the mayor elects not to vote, you have to have five votes to pass whatever it is you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5722)|
| 1:35:30| But you've got a motion to you've got a negative motion here, which always messes things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| But your negative motion, it would not pass, and you wouldn't have a positive motion to make, and so it would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5734)|
| 1:35:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| I just want to be real brief about this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| I appreciate the situation, but there is a dearth of information on this particular subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5752)|
| 1:36:00| When I'm in a situation like this, I haven't been able to attend the meetings that have been held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| I didn't know about them, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| Otherwise, I would have tried to make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| In these similar situations, I always place a lot of trust in the feelings of the district-specific representative who has attended the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5770)|
| 1:36:18| who has, you know, bird-dogged the situation to see if there is something that can work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| And I place trust in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| I think we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Just to remind everyone, the motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| And we'll go ahead and have a roll call vote, please, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Would you like to declare a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| The mayor is not going to vote on land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| You can ask for another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| There's no motion on the floor at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| We're still on the issue that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| I guess the proper thing to do is make a motion to approve the appeal and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| So I will make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| It's a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| If this motion, likewise, does not pass, aren't we in the situation where the appeal can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| go forward and the effect is failure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| Am I wrong on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| You will have run out of motions at the end of this motion if you're still 4-4, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| will fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Be motionless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Yes, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Mr. Swanson, at MPC, and maybe this is a question for Mr. Donaldson, sort of what happens with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5878)|
| 1:38:06| a failed motion like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| I know at Council things can't come back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Is that the same policy at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| The same request cannot come back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| Yeah, the exact same request can't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| It could be a different request, and it could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| So it's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| At a different zoning or in a different manner, the request can come back prior to a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| Keeping in mind that the sector plan is calling for medium-density residential, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| isn't any mention of commercial anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| I guess you'd call it to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| I think that takes precedence over the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| For four weeks, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| There's a motion and a second to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| I just want to know Councilman Hall's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| Motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| On to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Yeah, there was a second over here for Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Okay, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| I will defer to the district councilman if he feels that postponement would better accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| making a decision for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| I will defer to him on the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| You're against the postponement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| I'm against the postponement because we have all these residents here that that would mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| that they would have to re-come back up to this, to come back up here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| And if you look out here and see there are a lot of these people are elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| and they've had to rely on other people to bring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| And I just think that's an inconvenience we shouldn't put on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| I hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| We're back to there is a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| Any other discussion on that or ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| Motion fails 4-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| I haven't voted on land use planning since I've been mayor, so that won't change now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| I think we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Then that motion fails and the item is dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| 10-B is an appeal by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| Councilman Becker has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| For the benefit of the audience, can Mr. Swanson explain clearly what just happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| There was a motion to approve the amendment modification of the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| That motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Therefore, the one-year plan did not pass, as a result of which the rezoning issue becomes moot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| because under our charter it is unlawful for you to change the zoning so that it would be inconsistent with the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6071)|
| 1:41:21| So we don't have to take any action on 10-B or 12-U?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| It is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| It's moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| 10-C is an appeal by Travis Fuller of the Board of Zoning Appeals' denial of a variance to reduce a rear yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| from 10 feet to 4 feet for a commercial structure in a C-1 neighborhood commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| property located at 7425 Middlebrook Pike, in conjunction with Resolution 11-H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| which is a resolution approving the appeal by Travis Fuller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| I think there's someone here to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| I apologize if there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Is there anyone to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| This is the commercial building with the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Speak against it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| Speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| Well, I'm very puzzled because ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| I do not have anybody signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| Well, I'm totally puzzled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Because I cannot see people from where I sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| But it's my understanding that this has been ---- this is going to be amended this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6151)|
| 1:42:39| And I'm totally surprised that the attorney who has been working with all the parties involved is not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| So I wonder if he has stepped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| This is a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| I don't think this is the right piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| I think you're on the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| How did I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| This is a different thing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| How did I mess up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Yeah, but I still had a question about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| The ---- I haven't heard from anybody on this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| But in reading the record, it seems that one variance, which should be based on a hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| was already granted in terms of the rear setback for this commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| An error was made in the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| And so now they're coming back and asking for a second variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| And it would seem by the vote of the Board of Zoning Appeals that they did not see a further hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| and so denied this second variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| I can't really tell by all of this whether the building is completely up at this point, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| I think we need to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I'd just like a little more information before I vote on this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| Mr. Becker, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| I would say that that really was a hardship since the building's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| And I haven't looked at it, but I've talked to Mr. Fuller, and I'm pretty well aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| I think maybe Mr. Fuller, if you want to comment on that real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Travis Fuller, the Fuller Group, 9040 Executive Park Drive, Suite 109.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| I'm one of the owners of Middlebrook Commons, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| We had bought the property about three years ago at an auction and had a survey prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| Based on that survey, we hired Michael Brady Architecture to design a building per the survey done by LeMay and Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| permitted it through the city, went through the proper process and steps that I know to do as a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| We were about three-quarters of the way finished, steel, concrete, foundation, site prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| And our pen sets come up, and the contiguous property owner, Mr. Charles Baum, behind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| came out and said, guys, I think that your survey's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| And, once again, we're three-quarters into the building process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| And I said, well, I'll be glad to have, you know, checked your survey against yours, brought it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6285)|
| 1:44:52| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| It was inaccurate comparative to his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| And then we hired a third-party surveyor with Michael Brady doing a new survey, and it showed that his survey was correct, Mr. Baum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6296)|
| 1:45:05| So, at that point, you know, we had already applied for the variance that we needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| but found out during construction process that, obviously, our building was in the rear setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| And that's why I applied for a variance again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| And not being a developer myself, is there not any liability assumed by the surveyor for inaccurate information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| I'm sure there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| And the amount of that is typically the liability for the amount of work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6329)|
| 1:45:39| And I've spoken with contiguous property owners who don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| And I've had no opposition up until this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| Counselor Hucklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| Well, I don't think this was intentional on the part of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| I will say that having served several years ago on the Board of Zoning Appeals, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| the old joke was, you know, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| if you don't think you can get it on the front end and get it on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| But I don't think this was intentional in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| I do wonder, I mean, legally, you know, who knows what would happen if they tried to get damages from the surveyor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| if they did have to modify the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| But I just, you know, it's so hard to just say, well, gosh, you guys, you know, you got a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| you didn't comply with the variance, so we're going to let you pass just because you built your building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| and got that far along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| You know, I have a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| But at the same time, it seems that this wasn't intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| And, you know, they've got a building there, so it's a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| But anyway, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| You know, it's a hard one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Let somebody else talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| Mr. Becker, and then I'll come to Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| I guess one thing, Ms. Pilo, or Ms. Pilo, Ms. Roddy, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| While the minutes of the BZA indicated it was a two-to-one vote to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| actually in talking to people, you might know this, it was actually two votes in favor and one against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| but there were only three members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| So it was sort of a situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| I was surprised to see that and was interested to hear that cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| So it was two votes in favor and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| And I guess, Mr. Foley, I had a question for you about when you were informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| and when you actually learned that the survey was wrong and you were building a building illegally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| how quickly did you stop work on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Or did you sort of get to a good stopping point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| or did you just sort of continue and hope you'd get forgiveness later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| Actually, at that point we stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| The actual structure of the building, we continued to do the seating and the strawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| and the erosion control that was going to essentially where we thought we were on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| We got the slopes correct for Mr. Baum so it didn't have an adverse effect on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6474)|
| 1:48:01| And then after doing that and talking to some people and having our contractor make some contacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| we have since that point, since the appeal, moved forward because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| I've literally got tenants that are signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| and I will be obviously going back to see damages against LeMay and Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| if something goes wrong and this doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| And let me ask you, the way the building, the way it looks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| if this is denied and you have to move the building, this is not moving sort of an outbuilding or a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| This is actually sort of the whole back of a commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| You'd have to knock down and move forward six foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| I agree with Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| It's a bad situation to be in, but I feel like this isn't anybody's fault other than that surveyor who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| Definitely for me it wasn't a $2 million gamble that I was going to take to build it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| and ask for forgiveness later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| I just wanted to comment because this is actually across the street from my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| It's in Steve's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| However, I did a drive around back to Mr. Baum's property just to see, you know, what effect this would have on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6541)|
| 1:49:09| Absolutely none because the adjacent property owner also has the building backing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| And I just have to say I was watching with great pleasure this little center going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| because it is so very attractive and the streetscape along there had been really so blighted for a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| So this is really a tremendous improvement to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| and just a very unfortunate situation that these developers find themselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| So thank you for what you're doing for Middlebrook and for that little neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6577)|
| 1:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the owners of certain territory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| adjoining the bounds of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| an area generally being described as several tracks southeast and southwest of the intersection of Murphy Road and Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| relating to the proposed annexation of the territory by ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| and the reimbursement of public improvement costs in an amount not to exceed $800,000 over a four-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6613)|
| 1:50:20| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| Counselor Frost, did you have another comment or just to move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| I'm sure there are people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| There's actually one person signed up, Renee Hoyos, who's actually signed up in neutral ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Thank you for allowing me the time to speak with you regarding the annexation of certain properties owned by Mr. Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6632)|
| 1:50:40| First, I'd like to commend the city engineering department for their robust stormwater program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| I've often sought the counsel of city engineers on stormwater issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| and I found their commitment to stormwater management to be an asset to the community, if not a model for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| In regards to the annexation, though, it pains me that Mr. Jernigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| who has been in significant noncompliance of water quality laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| and has seemingly abused the corporate veil to skirt responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| will be receiving $800,000 for his work on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| The only bright light I see to this is that he will now be under the auspices of the city's stormwater program instead of the county's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6672)|
| 1:51:20| The city understands that while Mr. Jernigan's goal is to make money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| the city's responsibility is to protect the community from environmental degradation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| Knox County Engineering Department seems to think that their job is to assist developers who are maximizing profits at the expense of clean water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6688)|
| 1:51:36| I will not belabor the point that most of Knox County's streams are on the state list of polluted water due to mud coming from development activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6696)|
| 1:51:44| Stormwater flowing off developments in the county into the city's stormwater collection system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| also pollutes city streams and compromises the city's stormwater permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| It is my hope that by annexing Mr. Jernigan's properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| the city inspectors will be given the authority to swiftly perform the enforcement actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| that I'm almost certain will be required when it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| The network will be sorely disappointed if city inspectors will not be allowed to take appropriate enforcement actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6725)|
| 1:52:11| So while we see the water quality benefits of this annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| we will also be watching to make sure that local and state water laws will be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| And finally, reports in this morning's Knoxville News Sentinel that TCWN is considering legal options against Mr. Jernigan are inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6738)|
| 1:52:26| To date, TCWN has no plans at this time to file an action against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| I'd ask Mr. Jernigan to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| First, I want to also thank the city engineering department and city law department working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| trying to get the best deal possible for the city, for the citizens in terms of stormwater agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6764)|
| 1:52:53| This has been on our agenda since May, I think, and it's been a while getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| I mean, Mr. Jernigan and his partners are going to be investing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| Now, you all are the ones that are going to put in the sewer system for the increased capacity, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| Mr. Mayor, first, if you'd give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Victor Jernigan, 108 Stequoia, S-T-E-K-O-I-A, Stequoia Lane, Suite 103, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6792)|
| 1:53:22| The question was, you all are the ones that are putting in the sewer system for the increased capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| We're connecting to the KUB system, and KUB is going to determine how much capacity we can put on at any particular moment in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6808)|
| 1:53:36| Okay, but all that infrastructure is your all's cost, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Okay, so there's no cost to the city for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| I would like to make one short statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| As far as the Tennessee Clean Water Network is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| I personally have invited the members of the Tennessee Clean Water Coalition or Network to my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6832)|
| 1:53:59| I've invited to drive them around and show them any projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| I've asked them to sit down and look at plans with us, to review any documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| I have never received a visit, a phone call, or an e-mail from anyone with the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| They are certainly welcome at any time to look at any project and visit us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| and the assertation that we have numerous violations is patently untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| We do have one violation, which was corrected last May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| Just a procedural question, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| is whether or not it's appropriate to approve this prior to approving the annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| I mean, I don't realize technically we can probably do it in any order we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| but since Mr. Kaiser may want to respond to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| but since the annexation is sort of the overarching issue, if we don't annex and this is moved, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6886)|
| 1:54:54| What you could do is approve this subject to approval of that annexation item, which I think is 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| Yeah, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| I guess if we approve this, then, in essence, we've said we're going to approve annexation, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| Well, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| You've approved it subject to approval of that next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| One could read that either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| Yeah, I have a question for Mr. Kaiser about the contract on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| My understanding is the contract is where Mr. Jernigan is agreeing to do some work on Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6922)|
| 1:55:28| and we're going to reimburse him for some of the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| If that work isn't up to our standards or doesn't happen, we're not out for any money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| We're not liable for money prior to his construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| It's all reimbursement, and it is all after it meets our standards, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| It's all reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| It's all after it meets city standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| No reimbursement is due to be made until July 31, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| Before that, on June 1, 2008, he has an obligation to produce payment performance bonds to secure the performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6954)|
| 1:56:05| And there is, if there is an attack on the successful challenge to the annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6965)|
| 1:56:14| there is a repayment obligation as to the money the city has paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| The repayment obligation is on the part of Coventry Creek, personally guaranteed by Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6979)|
| 1:56:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=6986)|

| 1:56:40| I'd like to make a motion to amend so that, as Mr. Kizer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7000)|

| 2:02:04| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| I mean, it seems like there was a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| Mr. Swanson, does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| Steve, do you have an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Mr. King, do you have an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| Well, to a certain extent it makes sense, but I don't know that there's any legal basis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| This isn't an entire street closure like you may be thinking of, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| This is just a strip of property that's being proposed to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| But the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| The same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| I mean, the challenge we've had with improperly planted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| And I'm wondering, Mr. Swanson, my sense would be just to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| what we talk about upon application of the property owner, we'll give them a quick claim deed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| and change that to say application to the adjacent property owners and an agreement to replant the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| I just don't know that there's a basis for that legal requirement in terms of what you're doing here is closing a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7377)|
| 2:03:06| And I'm not aware of any ordinance or other provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| There could be created such an ordinance or provision of the code at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| but it doesn't exist now that authorizes that as a condition to the closure or remaining open of a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7395)|
| 2:03:27| And I would have some concern about our ability to add that as a legal requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7407)|
| 2:03:34| We'd actually have to change the law rather than change it in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| That was kind of where my thinking was going, that while it would be good to condition it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| it really makes more sense to address this in an ordinance, to create an ordinance that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| you've got to do this as part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| So let's just make that a priority of putting that on our agenda in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7435)|
| 2:04:02| Any additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| Item 12-I is an ordinance to change the street name of East and West Magnolia Avenue to East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| and West Regas Avenue between North Hall of Fame Drive and North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| Metropolitan Planning Commission applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| We do have several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| If you'd like to hear from them first, I'd take it, Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| And signed up to speak in favor are Mr. John King, Mr. Bill Regas, and Lee –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7465)|
| 2:04:33| I'm not sure I'm going to pronounce that last name right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| Shagnon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| Shagnon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Mr. Mayor, Members of Council, I'm John King, P.O. Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| I'm going to yield to Mr. Regas who has something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| I think it may resolve some of the issues about this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| Mr. Regas, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Bill Regas, Regas Restaurant, 318 North K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| First of all, I want to commend the MPC that came up with the idea of Regas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7505)|
| 2:05:15| I didn't know anything about it at the time, but I have to admit I agreed it was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7515)|
| 2:05:21| So we've had several meetings and there's a lot of neighbors here that I think are going to be happy here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7521)|
| 2:05:32| The MPC board voted 13 to nothing consensus, unanimous, for the Regas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7532)|
| 2:05:42| But my neighbors have been so strong, wanting to keep it the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| and I told them – they twisted my arm a little bit earlier on and told them that I was going to ask the council people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7547)|
| 2:05:58| that were going to vote with us to vote with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| So I'm conceding my two-minute concession speech, and I hope you'll vote to keep Magnolia as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7562)|
| 2:06:13| And maybe there's another way to honor Frank and George Regas, the founders of Regas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7573)|
| 2:06:21| and the 88-year-old restaurant is the oldest restaurant in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| And maybe that can be done in another way on another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7588)|
| 2:06:36| I did go out and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| I've been concerned about two Magnolia avenues running parallel, but I want to ask Mr. Donaldson if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7598)|
| 2:06:48| For several months, there weren't any signs up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| and I was visualizing Fifth Avenue turning into Magnolia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| which I think Mr. Donaldson said was necessary because of a DOT plan the way it came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7617)|
| 2:07:07| And then that made it desirable to have a new name for Magnolia from Hall of Fame to Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7627)|
| 2:07:17| and they suggested Regas Avenue, and that was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| But when I looked at it today, I noticed they had the Fifth Avenue sign up there at Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7642)|
| 2:07:33| and then you go right on down and you have the Magnolia sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| But can the Fifth Avenue sign stay there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| That won't have to be changed if council elects to keep Magnolia as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7660)|
| 2:07:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| That four-way intersection will have Hall of Fame in the north-south direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7668)|
| 2:07:54| Fifth Avenue going westerly, and East Magnolia going easterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| Well, I feel better about that because I thought it would be very confusing to have parallel Magnolia avenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7678)|
| 2:08:05| and I think there's a city ordinance that says we'll not have an old Magnolia like we had an old Broadway or an old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7685)|
| 2:08:14| So that clears that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| You won't have an old Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| You'll have Fifth Avenue, and then you'll have Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| So, and I understand as well that there's a committee working on improving Magnolia from, I think it's from Broadway all the way out to Cheoahe Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7707)|
| 2:08:40| and so you can feel good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| So I think hopefully there will be a way to recognize the senior Reguses that founded the restaurant in another way another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7723)|
| 2:08:55| And thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| And my neighbors and I are going to have a party at Regus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| Mr. King or Mr. Shagnon, anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| Good evening, Mr. Mayor, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| My name is Lee Shagnon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| I live at 424 Nichols Road here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| I'm also a member of the Public Property Naming Committee, which Chairman Joe Bailey is our chairman of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7755)|
| 2:09:24| Bill, I'm glad to hear what you had to say, but one of the things that we've recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| and Joe, I think once you've voted here tonight, we need to have a meeting as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| because one of the recommendations we're making to recognize the Reguses for all their years from the time it was a straight counter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7775)|
| 2:09:43| and Granddad was serving everybody to Bill's illustrious career is that we're looking at possibly taking the area from Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7783)|
| 2:09:52| where Regus is at, or Gay Street, Depot, and Magnolia to Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| and recognizing that with his dad and granddad and himself and calling it Regus Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| And that's one of the things, Joe, that we can get together and work on as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| because I really believe the Reguses do need to be recognized for everything they've done in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| I know there are several folks to line up to speak against in light of the recent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| You're still welcome to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| Sylvia and Harold Woods and Jack Piper, if any of you all would like to speak, you still may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7823)|
| 2:10:33| My name is Sylvia Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| I've lived at 412 East Moody Avenue since 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7835)|
| 2:10:41| And so you know I don't like a whole lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| I want to thank Mr. Regus for what he has done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| I work at the FLCL Labor Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| The building has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| It was the old Peabody School back in 1874.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| And the labor movement bought it in 1930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| So we've been in that area a long, long time and want to continue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| We want the street to stay Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| And we've been good neighbors, and we're all solid on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| I worked for the Regus restaurant and Bill and his family in 1960 through 62 while I went to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7874)|
| 2:11:25| Were you old enough to be working then, Sylvia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| You'll have to figure out how old I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| But I was a freshman, sophomore at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| So I have a great deal of respect for the Regus family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| And I am very much in favor of us doing something to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| But don't change our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| And it's not just don't change it to Regus Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| Just don't change it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| Leave it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| We use it as directional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| I don't think there will be any problem with people finding where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| And just like it's been mentioned tonight, if you change that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| then you're going to also have to change Fifth Avenue, which is going to cause a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| I'm sorry that TDOT came in there and moved all those streets around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| We knew they were going to make some improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| but we didn't know that they were going to feed the rows in the way that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7934)|
| 2:12:20| I have emailed and called and left messages and talked with a bunch of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7940)|
| 2:12:28| I did want to say while I'm up here that Sharon Davis is my sister,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| and she gave up her speaking, so I didn't want to give up mine today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| And I have done my homework with all of you all, and her client didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| So I will work with her in the future to make sure you all know what's going on when she's dealing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| I appreciate speaking before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| And I especially appreciate Mr. Regas so that he can make an easy decision for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| We appreciate you sending up the better half of that couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| No, we're not letting him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| Mr. Piper, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| I'll try to make these remarks brief, Mr. Mayor and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| My name is Jack Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| I'm an attorney here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| My office is in the Bank of America Center at 550 West Main Street, Suite 310.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=7993)|
| 2:13:20| I'm here tonight representing the interest of Mike and Betsy Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| Mike Frazier is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| Betsy is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| And there are some people here that were here to be present to show their opposition to changing Magnolia Avenue to any name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8007)|
| 2:13:37| Certainly, Regas would have been a fitting name if there was a need to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| But we're opposed to any change whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| In light of Mr. Regas's remarks, I don't know that the council is going to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8023)|
| 2:13:50| If we could assume by that that the vote will be that Magnolia Avenue will retain its name, then I'll be even more brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8030)|
| 2:13:57| I don't know if there's any way to signal that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| I see some council members nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| And I know that it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| We do appreciate the fact that I know there have been a number of attempts to contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| and we appreciate council being responsive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| We do have reasons that were stated before MPC as to why we were opposed to that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| and perhaps council has read some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| They are business reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| I would just simply mention that Mike and Betsy Frazier own not only the property at 200 East Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| where Knoxville Salvage is located, but they made a significant investment in the center city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| and they own the late property, the late packing property on Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| They own several other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| And we don't want to see a business that is thriving in the center city have other hurdles to get over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8082)|
| 2:14:52| And we feel like changing the name would simply do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| I'm going to just sit down at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| I think council is probably ready to take this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| and we look forward to a vote that would retain the name of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Very briefly, Magnolia is not the original name for this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| It's named after a daughter of a former mayor, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| I believe the original name is Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| But what I was trying to get on the table earlier was if it was possible to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8115)|
| 2:15:24| and handle the designation of Auriga Square this evening since this matter has been considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8124)|
| 2:15:31| and this would be a reduction of what is previously considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| I didn't know if that was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| Councilman Bynum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| I guess we'll go ahead and have a vote here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| But through this process of a number of public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| one thing has become crystal clear to me, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| And one is people don't want their street name changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| And, two, there is a lot of respect for the Regas family, the whole Regas family, for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8156)|
| 2:16:05| And people have fond memories of going to the Regas establishments over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| And I think also there's been members of the public property naming committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8171)|
| 2:16:18| that have suggested that we do something in honor of the Regases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| And several members of council have mentioned that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| And so have the business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| And so I think it's pretty much something that we need to go ahead and do, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8190)|
| 2:16:38| And I know you feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| And we will get our committee together and get the application in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8200)|
| 2:16:46| and do something out of respect for the Regas legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8206)|
| 2:16:51| And having said that, I make the move that we deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8211)|
| 2:16:56| The motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| Joe, anything else, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Motion is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| Thank you very much, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| 12J is an ordinance to change the street name of Kenilworth Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| to Kenilworth Lane between Aliceville Road and the dead end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| City of Knoxville applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8243)|

| 2:17:33| property located on the southeast side of Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| east side of Varner Street, Rick Mulkin applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| Excuse me, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| Yeah, this, I'd like this to not take more than a minute or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| but I wanted to ask Mr. Donaldson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| I guess two meetings ago when we approved the North City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| you talked about some different ways MPC is thinking about doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| commercial development, sort of concentrating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| focusing on neighborhood, community, and regional nodes more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| And we've got several commercial zonings coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| and an office one on Lowness that sort of even fits in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| And I wondered if you could just take a minute and a half or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| and kind of explain how these things might look different within the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| vision of doing a commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| Probably not a minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| I think we've seen with the successful adoption of the form-based codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| for the south waterfront that zoning is becoming more form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| and scale-related and less use-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| And as we have done small area plans throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| we are looking for zoning tools to implement those plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8328)|
| 2:18:54| that are more form-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| And generally if you look at the spectrum of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| and exclude the high-intensity industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| and the real low-intensity neighborhood uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| everything in between those can be regulated through scale so that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8351)|
| 2:19:17| in the recently adopted North City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| included a matrix to organize the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| and county zoning districts according to neighborhood, community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| and regional perspectives so that within a regional perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| you might have a collection of commercial office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| and even residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| You would have that same array within each of the various scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8382)|
| 2:19:48| So if you look at a particular parcel like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| which is on Sutherland, which is a minor arterial road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| with some residential uses adjacent to it and near it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| you might be thinking more neighborhood in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| As you move along Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| you might come to an intersection with another arterial road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| and that may move your scale to a community scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| If you follow that major arterial to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| or to another arterial road, you then get to a regional perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8419)|
| 2:20:25| So keep that in mind as we make plan amendments, adopt new sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8425)|
| 2:20:33| You'll be seeing that kind of a rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| And hopefully the recommendations that we get coming from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| will reflect that sort of thinking as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| Ms. Peel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| Well, I'll just comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| It is not my district, but my district adjoins the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| Of course, Mr. Brown is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| I would just have to say that Sutherland has really benefited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| from this type of reconsideration on land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8458)|
| 2:21:04| And I have to think of several new properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| which have replaced some very blighted properties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| And it has proven, I think, to be a very healthy thing for both the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| and for developing some commercial along that arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| And so I would say that if we were able to speak to those people who live in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8479)|
| 2:21:25| they would certainly support this because it has proven to be a very beneficial thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| that has really upgraded Sutherland in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| So thank you, Mark, for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8497)|

| 2:23:11| 12P is an ordinance approving the request of Steve Bethel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| for a one-year plan amendment from low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8594)|

| 2:23:24| southwest side of Bridgewater Road, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| I think we have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| We do have several folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| Would you like that to happen, Ms. Peel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| No, I would just say that I think it would be wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| if we heard from the speakers prior to making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| Signed up to speak in favor are Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| I think there's some others, but you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| I think Mrs. Mauer has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| She signed up this morning opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| I signed her up this evening in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| That's a great country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| This is called a miracle, isn't it, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| No, Ms. Mauer and I have gotten along together for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| This is a request for a rezoning from residential plan amendment residential to commercial and to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8651)|
| 2:24:24| Mrs. Mauer, Crestwood Hill, several of their representatives are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| and I have been discussing this thanks to the intervention of Councilman Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8669)|
| 2:24:35| and we have an agreement to announce subject to your all's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8675)|
| 2:24:41| First, the property owned by the church, other than a small part that I'll describe in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8681)|
| 2:24:50| will be removed from the zoning request, and I have drafted an appropriate resolution that would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| Second, Mrs. Mauer and I have discussed stipulations between Bethel Development Company and Crestwood Hills about the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8697)|
| 2:25:08| If I may, I'll just read those into the record very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| First, Bethel Development will leave undisturbed as many trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| and vegetation as possible on the north side of the property where the warehouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| these are many warehouses, will be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| Second, storage units will not be erected over one story unless a brick facade is placed at the end facing Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8724)|
| 2:25:32| We're going to further refine that between now and next reading if we get that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8732)|
| 2:25:39| It is not anticipated by the developer that they will be more than one story, but we're going to work on that a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8739)|
| 2:25:47| Three, Bethel Development will not build storage units on the church property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| and if we take the church property out, that makes it impossible to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| Four, security lighting for the warehouses will be directed away from any residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| Bethel Development anticipates that sensor lights will be used that would be a little brighter than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8761)|
| 2:26:09| However, those will only be activated by intruders onto the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| Fifth, no boats, trailers, mobile homes, motorcycles, RVs, or any equipment of that type will be visible from Bridgewater Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8774)|
| 2:26:27| assuming the same are stored on the property, and that is not a decision that has been made yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8787)|
| 2:26:33| Six, assuming that Comstock Road can be closed, and we understand it is a public road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8793)|
| 2:26:41| although it's got a gate across it right now, but if it can be closed and if this ordinance is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8801)|
| 2:26:48| Bethel Development will own both sides of the road and will petition for its closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8808)|
| 2:26:54| Then a gate at the entrance will be relocated closer to Bridgewater Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8814)|
| 2:27:03| And finally, we're going to provide further information about the layout and appearance of the facility between now and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8823)|
| 2:27:17| if we get that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| Any questions for Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| Ms. Pilum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| Ms. Maurer, do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| Yes, I was just going to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| 8824 Farmington Drive, Christwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| I'm president of the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| We have met today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| I have talked with Arthur regarding this problem and the problems that existed up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8857)|
| 2:27:44| and I do think that we have come to a very good resolution of what can happen and how this can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8864)|
| 2:27:50| However, I have to say there are two things that he mentioned that we will work on in the next two weeks to see if we can't resolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8870)|
| 2:27:57| Otherwise, everything else is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| The only thing is we have seen a layout, but we have not seen pictures of what this is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| So we're taking Arthur's recommendations and also the development company of what it's going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8886)|
| 2:28:13| but we do want to resolve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| And then, of course, we do want to resolve the signage that they want to put up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| Otherwise, I think everything is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| And thank you so much for your help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| and thank you for all of you listening to me on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| Ms. Pillow, do you have something else you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| Is there anyone else who's going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| Councilman Hulk was slighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| I have a motion, actually, which will be an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| so I would like to do that before we have any action on what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| If you want to go ahead and do that now, I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| Well, actually, we need a motion to approve first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| On 12-P, I want to read this so that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| We actually need a motion to approve so we can get it to so you can amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8940)|
| 2:29:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8942)|
| 2:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8943)|
| 2:29:04| Now you may go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8944)|
| 2:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| This is the motion which I'm going to read because it's very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| and very important to the agreement that has been reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| I really, before I make that motion, I just want to thank everyone for working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| It's been a very intense few hours in the past few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| and a great deal of agreement has been reached in consideration on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| So I really want to commend them for taking care of the issues which were very important to both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8970)|
| 2:29:37| So this is the motion, and I shall read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| I make a motion that Section 1 of the proposed ordinance be amended as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8980)|
| 2:29:46| Quote, the one-year comprehensive development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| and zoning plan for the City of Knoxville dated 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8990)|
| 2:29:54| and adopted by ordinance number 08407 is hereby amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=8994)|
| 2:30:00| so as to delete the classification low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| and medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| and to substitute in lieu thereof the classification general commercial for the following properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9008)|
| 2:30:16| Parcel number 119LA017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9016)|
| 2:30:22| parcel 119LA015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9022)|
| 2:30:27| located in a generally westerly direction from Bridgewater Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| and a parcel of land five feet wide parallel to the southern boundary of Comstock Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9031)|
| 2:30:38| and a parcel of land approximately 4,000 square feet at the southwest corner of Comstock Road and Bridgewater Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9038)|
| 2:30:46| Steve Bethel, applicant, file number 7D07-PA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9046)|
| 2:30:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| There's a second to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| Now, Councilman Hulkus, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| Actually, technically, you're speaking to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| I don't know where, if at any place, this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| I guess I have a couple of questions about Comstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| I'll start with Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| Mr. King, to your knowledge, is the portion of Comstock extending to the back of the church property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9074)|
| 2:31:22| indeed a public right-of-way and a city street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9082)|
| 2:31:28| I haven't looked at that, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| And I don't have that information here in front of me to be able to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9090)|
| 2:31:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9094)|
| 2:31:35| It appears to be so looking at the GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| If that's the case, do you have any idea why it's currently gated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| Is that appropriate to gate a public street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9107)|
| 2:31:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| More to the point and to what's before us for consideration, Ms. Mauer, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9110)|
| 2:31:56| Yes, I can answer your question, the reason it's gated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| Originally, when the telecommunication tower was moved up out of our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| and was moved to the church property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| at that time they built what they called a service road that would be used to service that tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9127)|
| 2:32:13| However, after it was built and it was not a full-size road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| they decided that that was not the best road to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| so they built another service road at the other end of the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| And the reason that has been gated off all these years is to keep people out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9144)|
| 2:32:30| because it had become a lover's lane, it had become a very bad situation up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| So that was the reason that the gate was put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| And the people that live next door, the Ravies, have been very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| That's the reason why we asked to have the gate, the new gate to this new property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9162)|
| 2:32:48| moved up closer to Bridgewater so that they could see exactly who's going back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9168)|
