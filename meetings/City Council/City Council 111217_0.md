| 0:02:49| You didn't raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| I was pushing my butt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Did you see my butt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=172)|

| 0:02:59| I just wanted to thank Joe, he stepped up at a time when we were kind of in transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| and he helped lead us and give us the guidance and the benefit of his knowledge in the prior seven or eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| and he was here at the time to help those of us who were newer, you know, get through the maze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| and we appreciate your leadership and dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| Joe, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate your mentoring us the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| and what I especially enjoy about working, or enjoyed about working with Joe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| is that even though you and I were on opposite sides on a number of situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| we still had this great deal of respect for each other, and I carry that respect on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| So, thank you so much for all you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=221)|

| 0:03:46| Joe, I would like to thank you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| Like Duane, you and I were not always on the same side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| but when we were, sometimes we were both surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| That's always a good thing, and I do appreciate your leadership and helping us through a time of transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Let me add my voice to that, to Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| He's done an excellent job, and it's been a job that not always gets the awards that it should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=249)|
| 0:04:18| but certainly he's done an excellent job, and we appreciate his service very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| So, I just want to add my comments to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| I don't really know how to top what they've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| but not only Joe, but all the AFL-WIN members, as we said at our meeting a week or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| they brought transparency and openness and really did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| They did everything that came before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| and that's something that will never cease to be in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| and thank you for your leadership of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=292)|

| 0:05:21| and a document which describes the rules that Council has gone by when selecting a new Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| Are those the rules that Council wishes to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=327)|

| 0:11:06| I think I'll back off, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| All right, come on. Come on, join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| Well, I think public transportation is a real key component to a viable city, and I think we've got to work on it, and it's a big budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=674)|
| 0:11:25| and I think we need to have someone there that we can work on the numbers and make sure that it stays an important part of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| So, I'll say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| Okay, so we have two names, Mayor Brown and Councilmember Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| So, as your name is called, please say the last name that's either Brown or Wallace, and let us know who you intend to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=701)|

| 0:12:22| Results are 7-2, so Mayor Brown, you are the representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=742)|
| 0:12:33| Okay, actually, we do need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Move to second that Mayor Brown be the representative to KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Okay, so, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| And I believe that is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Is there any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Madam Mayor, since our esteemed legal counsel is leaving, or I guess is left, it's official, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| You're no longer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| I'm still your lawyer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Oh, you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| I have not been sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| When will you be mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| When I was sworn in, which will be very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| I was just wondering if it would be appropriate to go ahead and decide or make some decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| about having a meeting with counsel to discuss process on how counsel is going to go about selecting your replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=799)|
| 0:13:29| If we could go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| I know we're taking applications, but some of us would like to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| At a special called meeting, you're only allowed to conduct that business which you have advertised in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| We have not advertised in advance considering that process or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| so I would have to say that it would be inappropriate at this time to consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| but that's something that you can take up very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Just with regard to procedures, certainly you can talk among each other with regard to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| You may not deliberate with regard to that subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| but you may talk about process and procedures under the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Can we talk about just having a meeting, maybe not anything about it, but a date or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| Is that permissible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Since that is just process and you can do it out in the audience, I would think that perhaps you could if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| We're going to miss Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| We're going to miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| It won't be far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Madam Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| It may be that we should have Susan give us some Thursdays by e-mail that we can meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| since we usually use the Thursdays other than Council Week as our workshop time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Maybe we could set one up that would be like right after the first of the year sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| and you could give us a couple of dates and we could answer to your e-mail about when that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| Is that permissible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| So the purpose for which this meeting was called having been accomplished without objection, the meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111217?start=907)|
