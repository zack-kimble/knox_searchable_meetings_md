| 0:01:06| Join me in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=68)|
| 0:01:27| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| Mentioning that today is February 11th, also the date is 2-1-1, so it's National 2-1-1 Day, and for those of you who aren't familiar, our 2-1-1 is an incredible service in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=92)|
| 0:01:45| It's an emergency telephone line for social service information, and it's free, and it connects people with vital services like housing, food, health facilities, legal and tax assistance, child care, and numerous volunteer opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=105)|
| 0:01:59| Thank you to all the partners who help make this system work each and every day. So, happy 2-1-1 Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| I also wanted to, it is a very special year for women's suffrage, and this Saturday I'm going to be sharing a proclamation in person with a gathering of League of Women Voters, but I understand some members of the League are here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=125)|
| 0:02:24| Raise your hand, good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| And I wanted to, with the Council's agreement, read the proclamation on behalf of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=147)|
| 0:02:36| So, on behalf of the people of the city of Knoxville, and her Honor, the Mayor, me, India Kincannon, I want to publicly recognize the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=156)|
| 0:02:46| Whereas the League of Women Voters is a nonpartisan organization that for 100 years has played a critical role in fostering civil debate and shaping public policy in myriad ways to reform government and create a more just and equitable society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=166)|
| 0:03:01| And whereas Carrie Chapman Catt, President of the National Woman Suffrage Association, proposed to establish the National League of Women Voters as a department of the National Suffrage Association at its convention in St. Louis, Missouri on March 19, 1919, a year before the 19th Amendment passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=181)|
| 0:03:21| And whereas on February 14, 1920, six months before the 19th Amendment was ratified, the National League of Women Voters was organized as a, quote, mighty political experiment aimed to help women exercise their responsibilities as new voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=201)|
| 0:03:37| And whereas Ms. Catt's tireless nationwide campaign met with success when Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment on August 18, 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=217)|
| 0:03:49| Whereas since the 1920s, the League has continued to organize get-out-the-vote campaigns and collaborate with numerous organizations to increase civic participation and fight for important reforms such as voting rights, fair elections, open government, campaign finance reform, education, and environmental protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=229)|
| 0:04:07| And whereas on the occasion of the National League's 100th anniversary, it is fitting to honor and recognize its numerous accomplishments in our country and community and thank League leaders and members for advocating on behalf of the rights of women, minorities, and additional historically marginalized groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=247)|
| 0:04:24| Now, therefore, I, India Kincannon, Mayor of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee, do hereby proclaim February 14, 2020 to be League of Women Voters Day in our city and urge all citizens to join in this observance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=264)|
| 0:04:38| So, thank you very much to the League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| We really appreciate all your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| I love voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| I know many of my fellow women across the city and across the country take that right very, we value it a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=284)|
| 0:04:53| And so, thank you and your League for all your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| I'm also a member of the League and I'm proud to be so and I look forward to sharing this proclamation with you all in a larger group this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| I wanted to just remind council members this Friday, in addition to being League of Women Voters Day, is also our annual budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| So, please, I look forward to sharing with you on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| It's Friday, February 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=319)|

| 0:05:44| Also, we are one month out from the census, decennial census, starting in earnest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| March 12 is the date when people should start receiving notifications in their mailbox and that notification will tell them how to answer by mail or go online and answer online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=350)|
| 0:06:02| Please respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| A lot of things are at stake, our representation in Congress, millions of federal dollars for roads, schools, child care, senior care, transit, and all things that really matter to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=365)|
| 0:06:16| And just so you know, in 2010, the most undercounted census tract in the state was right here in Knoxville, Tennessee, where the UT campus is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=376)|
| 0:06:26| So, if you are a student attending the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, you've got to count yourself right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| And let's change that, let's not be last, let's be first this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| There's more information on CountMeInKnox.com, including videos about the census, a great story from the Compass about our outreach efforts to ensure an accurate count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=397)|
| 0:06:48| We've got a game plan, we've got a lot of grassroots partners, media coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| And tonight, on item 11D is a resolution proposing some additional funding for public service announcements with our partners Visit Knoxville to produce some of those PSAs, and I hope you'll vote in favor of that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=413)|
| 0:07:06| Okay, so, of course, we are in February, which among other things we celebrate is Black History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| I invite everybody to go see the Knoxville Museum of Art, Buford Delaney and James Baldwin, Through the Unusual Door is the name of an exhibit celebrating one of Knoxville's most renowned and celebrated artists in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=434)|
| 0:07:27| who sometimes doesn't get the recognition he deserves in his own hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| So let's change that, and we can start by attending this exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=451)|

| 0:07:50| And the reason that James Baldwin's part of it is that he was a mentor to James Baldwin when they were living in Paris in the 20s or 30s, you know, a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=470)|
| 0:08:01| But they had a great correspondence and connection, and that's a part of the exhibit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| There's also a plaque at 501 Summit Hill Drive that marks the site of the childhood home of Buford Delaney and his brother Joseph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| And the East Tennessee Historical Society funded and erected that in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| There's more information about this and other Knoxville black history commemorations on our website, knoxvilletn.gov forward slash black history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=501)|

| 0:08:42| And there are many of them, so I will invite council members and members of the public to check that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| And we'll be adding new reports throughout this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Last but not least, KPD is promoting many officers to higher ranks, and that celebration is going to be this Monday, February 17th at 3 p.m. in the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=532)|
| 0:09:05| We'll be honoring three newest captains, six lieutenants and seven sergeants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| So you're all invited to come and acknowledge and honor those hardworking members of our police force who have earned promotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=551)|
| 0:09:20| And that is it for, oh, I got ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=560)|

| 0:09:32| It's a proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| I blame Councilwoman Ryder for going out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Forgive me, but let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| That's it for my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=581)|

| 0:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Any further items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| So, Mayor, let me go ahead and get this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| And my apologies, I've been out of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| so I was not very prepared today for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| But we will do a formal resolution at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| But, again, we wanted just to acknowledge on behalf of the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| members and myself just thanking Council Member Stephanie Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| for her service on City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| As everyone knows, she was elected November 7th in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| She is also a member of the United States Army Reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| She's actually a major in the reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| We have enjoyed having your foresight in working on issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| your outreach to the community, and also the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| and also in your district, and that you come back with solid facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| You have been a very good collaborative partner with Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| and you will definitely be missed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| and we look forward to working with you in your new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| So congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=954)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Seeing no other reports from Council members, we'll move on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Item A is an ordinance to amend the Fiscal Year 19-20 Operating and Capital Budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I'd like to ask Deputy Finance Director Boyce to maybe talk to us a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| these are defined as housekeeping items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Could you tell us a little bit about what's going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Boyce Evans, Deputy Finance Director for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| The total budget amendment is $5,632,945.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| And like I say, it is all housekeeping in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| $924,959 worth of that were encumbrances from purchase orders and contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1016)|
| 0:17:05| that outstanding at the end of the fiscal year as we crossed FYs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| In other words, awards had been made to various vendors and contractors and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| but the funds hadn't been dispersed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So we need to reappropriate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| And then you FY, every time we cross fiscal years, we have money that falls into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| The other, it was a $3,838,482 worth of affordable rental housing funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1048)|
| 0:17:37| These were unencumbered, unspent as we crossed fiscal years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| but we were working with the developers at the end of the FY for affordable rental projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1060)|
| 0:17:48| and the developers had already applied for the gap funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| And the details were being worked, but we weren't far enough along to disperse the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| Actually, these are done on a reimbursable basis anyway in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| Anyway, so you've got to reappropriate that into the new fiscal year in order to proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| And the money has to be used for the purpose for which it was intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| which is affordable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| And then the final one that made up that $5.6 million was $859,504 worth of historic preservation dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1099)|
| 0:18:29| that were unencumbered, unspent as we crossed the FY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| The winners of the proposals for the RFP on that had already been determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| We were working out the details with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| But again, some of the awards had not been made, and that money also, it's done on a reimbursable basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1121)|
| 0:18:50| They have to do the work and then ask for it before we can give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| So we're reappropriating that into the current FY so we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| Thank you for explaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| 9B is an ordinance to amend Section 2-450 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| to adjust the City of Knoxville's classification and compensation plan for general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Oh, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Well, I just had a few questions about this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1168)|
| 0:19:39| I'm going to ask Vicki Hatfield to come to the podium, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| to answer Councilwoman Parker's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| That would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| I didn't get a chance to get the full list of compensation and classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| but that was what I was curious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| When we're moving them down a pay grade, what does that represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| What pay range are we moving these positions to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| And that is very uncommon, I will say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| We won't see often that we reallocate something downward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| This was a reorganization requested by Public Service Director Chad West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| He just is looking at a reorganization of that planning and safety function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| He's actually expanding it in scope currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| There's a small function performed by one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| We have a vacant Public Service Operations Manager position that hasn't been filled in many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| He's decided to use that position and restructure it to be more of a management role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| in this planning and safety function to expand the scope of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| He has taken a lot of initiative in his department to do a lot of great training for his employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| safety training and equipment training, and this is sort of an expansion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| So he's basically sort of splitting the function, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| It's currently small and done by one person, broadening it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| and it's going to use that vacant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| So rather than have that manager position that is currently at a pay grade 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| he's actually kicking that down to a pay grade 8 because the duties are going to be completely restructured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| and they're going to be more comparable to a pay grade 8 position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Likewise, the smaller function, because he's broadening it in scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| they're going to be sort of a shared function now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| So he's reallocating both of those positions downward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| so that he's sort of splitting the function between two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| While it's bigger in scope, we're going to have two people doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| So currently one is vacant, the other position is filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| and that employee is aware of these changes and does not have an issue with these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1314)|
| 0:22:02| Do you have any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Just do you have a sense of what that pay range is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| What the pay range is? Oh, and I do not have it right here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| So, no, without looking, a pay grade 8 typically is going to be, I'm going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| without having it right in front of me, it's probably going to start somewhere in the low 40s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| probably going up to the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| A pay grade 9 position currently would probably be in the mid to high 40s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| and would go up to probably in the high 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| So each of those are just going to slide down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| The employee that's currently in the safety coordinator position is sort of in the middle of that range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| so his salary will not be impacted by this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1369)|

| 0:25:15| Councilwoman Parker, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Just a quick comment. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| And I thought I would bring it up because maybe other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| out in the public didn't realize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| And correct me if I'm incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| but I didn't realize until we received this budget request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| that the income for this budget is actually established by a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1534)|
| 0:25:43| And I think it is an interesting model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| I think it seems to be the only model that we have within our city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| at the moment where an area of our city has been able to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| and have a special tax that's implemented that creates this business district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| and all of those taxes goes towards that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| I believe it's the only one we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Most improvement districts follow this model in cities around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| and they choose to assess themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| and then spend the money in ways to improve their own security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| or plant things or other things to invite more people to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| and patronize their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| So I think it is unique in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| but it's certainly not unique across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| There's probably multiple ones in bigger cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| But, yeah, there's a self-assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| and then they choose how to spend the money too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| I think they are obliged to come before city council just for greater transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| and make sure that we are aware of the kinds of money they're raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| and how they're spending it and just for our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| But, yeah, it's money they raise and spend sort of in a more autonomous manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Well, except the tax that we levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| There is a tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| I don't know if it's associated with downtown residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Rick Emmett, I think, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| He's been part of the city's representative on the CBID board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| which also now goes by the name Downtown Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| It's Downtown Knoxville Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Downtown Knoxville Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| If you could explain the history and mechanics of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| It's not a city tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Well, anyhow, I'll let you explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| It's an assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| The CBID was created in 1992 by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| There was a neighborhood group, a downtown group formed back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Of course, downtown was not in really good shape back in those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| And they polled all the members of the downtown area, got a petition together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| It's an act of the legislature, as I understand it, creating the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| So the city council had to adopt it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| I think the assessment is $0.32 per hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| It's sort of like a tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| The folks that own property within the CBID pay the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| So it's nobody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| So all the members of the CBID are all property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| And so the board proposes a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| It goes to the general membership once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| The general membership actually votes on the budget itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| We have several subcommittees there that meet to discuss various ways to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| allocate the monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| And that's always open to the public and the membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| So Michelle Hummel is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| She's a director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| And Tim Hill is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| He's chairman of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| So I don't know if they want to add anything to that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| But did that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| Yeah, no, I think it's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| And I think it's a model that we on city council and others should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| familiar with as we're thinking about ways to empower other parts of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| community to be able to pull together and help spur some economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| So thank you for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1741)|

| 0:29:38| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| As our downtown has continued to be revitalized and become an even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| vibrant public space, we've seen more requests for downtown festivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| And this district is accomplishing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Currently, open containers of beer or alcoholic beverages are prohibited on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| any public street, public sidewalk, or public parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| Similar to other special permits that we already have in Market Square and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| the Old City, this ordinance creates a downtown festival district to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| temporarily allow beer sales and open containers within a defined space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| Within the festival area, wristbands will be required and only approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| containers will be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| It's important to note that the festival area will have to be free to enter in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| order to ensure that the public can continue to use their access to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| public streets, public sidewalks, and it can also continue to be able to visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| downtown businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| This proposed festival district is also within the boundaries of the tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| development zone, which allows the city to capture local and state sales tax in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| order to service convention center debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| And I know Deputy Director Evans can answer questions about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| So this is something that we're hearing a lot of requests for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| We certainly in the previous agenda item, we heard about how downtown had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| different at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Certainly growing up here, I remember those times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| We're in a place where folks want to have festivals downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| And so this is just another element and another exciting thing that shows how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| much excitement there is out there for our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| When I was reading about this, isn't that what already exists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Is it just expanding it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Because on, like, A Street, there was already the Rossini Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| And weren't we serving beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I mean, is this just expanding some of the rules that we've had in other places already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| I'm going to let – what's your title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Rob Frost is going to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| He's our lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Council Attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I think this is better clarifying the areas that this can go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| Councilmember Singh, it's putting on the book something that – I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| there's the creation of a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| And that map will be kept in the recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| And it defines the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| A festival is not required to use the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| It can pick within the small – you know, a smaller part of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| But this just clarifies what we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| And then it makes – it also clarifies that there are boundaries and a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| I mean, for the members of City Council, since you're on the beer board too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| at the next month's – or, excuse me, this month's beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| there will be the new forms for this type of permit, assuming the permit passes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1965)|
| 0:32:55| And I'd like to say the OPERA has been wonderful to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| The information that they've already submitted will be in substantial compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| for their permit to be granted at the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| It's a little unusual to be talking about that here and not at beer boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| But – so this is something we've been doing for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| and we're just defining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Have there been any problems with minors drinking or incidences going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=1997)|
| 0:33:26| I don't know who to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| Mr. Emmett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Chief Thomas, I mean, any incidences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Probably there's been some, but Chief Thomas, any comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| If there are, of course we'll address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| We always have officers around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I mean, we've had sporadic incidents in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| I mean, I think a lot of juveniles are tempted when they go downtown and do try,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| but I have every confidence that we'll do everything we can not to sell to those juveniles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| I just want it to be something on our minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| and that if we're expanding the area a little bit, to just be aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| 12B is in ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Extending the moratorium imposed by ordinance numbers O-137-2018, O-16-2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| and O-101-2019 upon shared mobility vehicles within the City of Knoxville through September 2, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2068)|
| 0:34:36| with the exception of those shared mobility vehicle providers operating in accordance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| and authorized by the City's pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| So from reading this, it sounds like there's two different parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| One, we are continuing the study for six more months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| and not allowing it to be just what continues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| And it said we're trying to still study a few more things, trying to get a few more facts together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| Do you know what those are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Yeah, I'm going to ask Chip Berry to come answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| He's been the lead person on behalf of the City on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| Thank you, Chip Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| I'm Chip Berry, Deputy Chief of Operations for the City of Knoxville, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| So scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Scooters are exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| So you really have one item in front of you today, and that is the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| and related to extending that moratorium for a six-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| That moratorium allows us to then continue operating scooters under the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| So it's two separate pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| The contracts we have with the scooter companies are totally separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| Those were approved last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| We're able to extend those, but we have to have the moratorium extension approved in order to extend those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| So the intent of extending that, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| One, we knew we had a new mayor coming in and some new members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| so we wanted to bring you up to speed on what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| And then also we wanted to do a community survey as one of the pieces that we're planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| We haven't done that piece of the study yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| We also are gathering information about best practices across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| Scooter information changes very rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| Different cities are addressing it in different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| and I can honestly tell you that a lot of cities have looked at what we're doing here to better manage scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| and are implementing those strategies in their locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| And then the last piece is we'll bring to you, hopefully in the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| our intention is to bring to you a set of regulations that you might put in place through an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| that allows us to have scooters in the city of Knoxville if you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| That sounds good, especially the survey, to see how people feel, because I hear about it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| I do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Deputy Chief Berry, I've certainly come to see times where I've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| seen kind of a pooling of the scooters or one kind of randomly out in some space by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2232)|
| 0:37:21| or even, you know, on occasion blocking a sidewalk or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| Have you heard reports of anything like that occurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| We have had contact about those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| One of the things we did under the study is we specifically picked two different models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| of the way the scooter companies operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| One of the scooter companies takes their scooters off the street every night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| and they recharge them at a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| They bring them out at 7 a.m. in the morning, restage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| The other company leaves their scooters out 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| and their scooters are a battery pack that they just change in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| So they don't have to take them off the street to recharge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| We did that on purpose to see how those models worked in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| It was a newer type model, and other cities hadn't experienced it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| So we wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| What we've learned is those scooters that are left out 24 hours are like what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| There's random one here, one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Sometimes they're blocking sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Sometimes they're pulled together in front of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| And so in the contracts going forward, if you approve the moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| we're going to require those scooter companies to take their scooters off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| Excuse me. Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| We're going to require the scooter companies to only operate from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| The scooters will be shut down through the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| They will be required to restage them and rebalance them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| There's two functions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| On a daily basis so that we will address that issue more clearly every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| Okay. And then what have you heard about injuries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| I know safety has been one of the things that I've heard some concern about too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Have you had any reports of injuries or can you comment on that any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| So every month our scooter working group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| which is a group of various departments within the city, takes a look at all the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| We look at how much the scooters are used, how often they're used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| the length of time that they're used, and then we also look at any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| So we ask our vendors to provide us with how many customer service calls they've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| and we also look at the calls from 311 and how many calls those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| Those numbers have significantly decreased since we've started in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| and we have had three instances through KPD's report of injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| Only one of those persons decided to go to the hospital, and they were treated and released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| Out of we have 255,000 rides, we've had three injuries reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| I also had the question that led to your explanation about why you're now asking both companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2399)|
| 0:40:10| to pick up the scooters at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Just one concern with that is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| one of the major goals of these machines is to help us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| further along in our sustainability goals, and this being an alternative form of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| And some of the reports that I've read have said that when you have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2434)|
| 0:40:45| gas-powered trucks that are driving around the city monitoring, gathering up these units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| and placing them every day, you still have that carbon footprint to be concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| And so, you know, the only thing I would offer is trying to think about ways to deal with the mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2461)|
| 0:41:11| and things on the sidewalk that don't, you know, create a carbon footprint unnecessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2471)|
| 0:41:21| So if we put a policy in place that asks both companies to clear all of these, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2481)|
| 0:41:30| scooters every night, whether there's a problem or not, whether there's a mess or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| that, you know, we might be defeating the purpose of having them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| if we're requiring that much kind of running around of gas-guzzling trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| I understand the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| I want to make clear again that we're not requiring the companies to remove the scooters every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| but they will be moving them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| So the rebalancing means that they will be replacing them based on market demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| and then restaging is my term for making them look pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| so that we don't have that one scooter sitting around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| We don't have scooters sitting in front of a building blocking the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Back to your issue about sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| one of our objectives and most cities' objectives in this use of scooters or micro-mobility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2532)|
| 0:42:20| was to address that first-mile-last-mile issue with transportation, with public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| and every city has realized it's really not meeting that demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| It wasn't necessarily to adjust the carbon footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| It could help because they're not gas-powered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| But in this instance, our first objective was to try to address that first-mile-last-mile issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| but again, most cities through their studies have determined that's not really addressing that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Chicago has done a pilot study recently where they've connected their scooters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| are not in the main tourist district inside the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| They're outside in the suburbs, and they're connected to transit systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| So in that model, they are benefiting in there because they specifically focus that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Mr. Berry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| So is it just because it's winter, it's a very warm winter, but are they somehow out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| Am I not seeing them as used right now because it's not winter or because it is winter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| Cooler temperatures and lots of rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| So Spin, which is the orange scooter that you see out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| they don't allow their scooters to operate in the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| And most of the time, VEO will also shut down their app in the wet weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| They don't really want people riding scooters in wet weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| So they're out there, but you can't function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| The VEO ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| The app won't even work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| But it is cooler weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| The numbers dropped significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Our highest user numbers were in May when you launched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| and that is traditionally what happens in any city when they launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| So the first month is usually the higher user rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Now, we saw it kind of leveled off during the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| and then we saw a jump when UT came back into session, not surprising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| and then it leveled off again, and now it's dropped off to normal kind of wintertime usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| We'll see a jump in the spring when the weather gets better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Because I only realized recently that I hadn't seen them out and about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| and we do have a lot of rain in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| But when I did see them, it wasn't people on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| It was the black and blue ones, turquoise, whatever, thrown about all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| Which is one of the reasons why we're requesting that they rebalance them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| and restage them every day because they're not currently required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| I'm not a fan of them thrown about all over blocking sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And actually, this happened to be where a bus stop was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I just don't think that's very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| If you do see those issues, you can call 911, and they will directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| You mean 311?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| I mean, sorry, 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| I need all responders alerted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| One of our downtown officers is back here saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Call 311 and report that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| They have two hours to reallocate those scooters to move them out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| My experience with them was in Indianapolis when I had a friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| and we were there, and she was in a wheelchair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| and we could literally not use the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| And then I was in California, and my other friend that I was with there tripped over one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| So I'm just a big fan of them not being in the sidewalks, even if they're out of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| And I appreciate Councilwoman Parker's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| I've seen the trucks, both here and other cities, run around picking them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| So I get that that's a point, but I just don't think I've –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| I want people to be able to use the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| and I don't appreciate having three of them littered around a bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| So I will call that in next time I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| The requirements of the scooter company is that they have to leave three feet of clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Okay, from a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| If they're staging them on the sidewalk, which is typically where they stage them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| they're supposed to leave three feet of clearance around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Okay, well, most of the problems have been with people actually using them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| and buzzing by you so that you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| And that was my experience in Indianapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| I know that was a complaint here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| We have significantly addressed that issue here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| and did a major campaign to reduce the ridership on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Did the stickers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| We required the scooter companies to notify all their users about the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| and regulations on a regular basis through the text messaging system they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Also, whenever you open the app to start a scooter ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| it reminds you of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| You have to accept that understanding of those rules in order to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| One of the things that's different, every state has their own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| So, for instance, in Florida, you have to ride them on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| So if you've ridden them in Florida and you come here, maybe as a student at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| you naturally may want to ride them on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| But every scooter now, based on our requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| says that no riding is allowed on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| There's scooters on the sidewalk to prevent you from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| The app is telling you not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| And we've reduced that significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| And you may not know the answer to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I'm a big fan of helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| We still have helmets available at the Visitor's Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| I think that was an option that came out with the Pace bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| It's not required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| It is recommended, of course, but Visit Knoxville does have some helmets available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| So you mentioned that there will be reduced hours, 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| Could you tell us what the normal hours of operation are currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Well, so VEO operates 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| That's the green and black scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Spin currently operates to 9 p.m. every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| They take them off the street and restage them at 7 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| So now we've seen how things work and don't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| and so now we're putting some new regulations in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2891)|

| 0:49:45| I know you say they're kind of administrative in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| and cleaning up things, but maybe go through these with us a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=2989)|

| 0:50:03| that the Planning Commission, not the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| may use special use exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| The change to Section 1.4.J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| confirms that the Downtown Design Review Guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| apply to properties in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3013)|

| 0:50:19| confirms that the Established Neighborhood District Designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3019)|

| 0:50:31| is a follow-up to a discussion at the Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| where there was some concern about the application of the Institutional District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| The Purpose Statement now states that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| areas to which the Institutional Zone is applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| shall be a minimum of five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3047)|

| 0:51:07| The initial language left out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| is that they apply in the Institutional District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| The change to Section 14.12.A and B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| assigns full administration of the Design Review Board to planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| and adds a citizen member to the Design Review Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| in place of the formerly there was a staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| that created some challenges with the Open Meeting Law and Review of Projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| I want to thank you for addressing the Established Neighborhood section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| I know we talked about that a lot during the recode process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| and making sure that all neighborhoods, no matter what size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| have the option to apply for the Established Neighborhood status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Well, I appreciate the instigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| It actually came from someone in the audience, David Nix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| who represents his neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| and his neighborhood is certainly an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| It's a historic neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| and it didn't meet the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| for the former Established Neighborhood designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| He pointed out that his neighborhood is established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| and I think that led to the whole discussion and the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you for summarizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Director Green, could we just consider—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| sorry, I don't have my glasses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| so I'm, like, trying to read and find the right part here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| On the Section 8.2.A changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| which is the institutional district determining the size of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| could we be slightly more specific and say five contiguous acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| So I just need to make an amended—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| That's the intent, but that would certainly clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| I feel that the intent there is one area of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| So we have a motion on the floor, I think, is how we started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| That's my only comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Then I'll make an amended motion to add the word contiguous there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3188)|
| 0:53:17| in Section 8.2.A to define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| There's actually two spots in the section that's read there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| Area zone institutional shall have a minimum size of five contiguous acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| The area designated as an institutional district may be composed of lots of various sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| with a minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| but the total area shall contain a minimum of five contiguous acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| versus piecemealing parcels together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Motion made to amend the original motion by adding the word contiguous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| as she just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| Yes, two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| And it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Is there any further discussion on the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| All those in favor of this amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| The amendment carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Is there any further discussion on the amended motion or the motion as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| Seeing none, all those in favor of the amended motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| The amendment carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| 12F is an ordinance to close a portion of Myrtle Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| between the northern right-of-way line of East 5th Avenue and Terminus and Dead End| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| and authorize the mayor to execute quitclaim deeds to the adjacent property owner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Knoxville Applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3275)|
| 0:54:50| Council, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| There is someone signed up to speak to this on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| So, Mr. Christopher Sammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| If you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| My name is Christopher Sammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| I live at 1710 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| I represent the block of neighbors immediately adjacent to the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| I'm sure council is aware we fought with Mayor O'Hara to defeat gifting our parkland to the VMC for supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3315)|
| 0:55:23| The motion before you was supported or sent in tandem to close this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| so that way there were not any obstructions between the green space on East 5th Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| and the positive living building which they were claiming to be in process of purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| Since we have decided as a city that we no longer wish to go down that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| it seems unnecessary to close the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| There are a lot of questions pertaining to this because the original proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| and the only proposal that was given to public or had a public meeting about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| was the one to be built on the open public green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| So, as for any need to continue to close this section of road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| we have no knowledge of or there is not currently a proposal that has been presented to the public at any capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| With that lack of knowledge, we have to ask why are we still being asked to close this section of public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| If the green space is going to stay green space, it should be no longer necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| The land next door as of this afternoon is still deeded to the positively living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| so one might ask why are we closing a public road when the VMC has failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| to complete its purchase of the positively living structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| I don't understand how an applicant can be asked to close a public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| if they don't indeed own the land neighboring to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| The amount of land that closing this road would give to the VMC is negligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| It's still actually used as an access point for the farm equipment that's used to grade the baseball fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| by the City of Knoxville's Parks and Rec Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| So, if we close it, then they have no way to grade or maintain the southern-facing fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| Moving right along, I sent all of you an email a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| in our battle with Mayor Rojero. We came across some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| The City of Knoxville applied for a grant to construct Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| The Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978, administered through the National Park Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| granted the City funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| The funds and the contract that the City signed very explicitly state that the City is beholden to the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| and that you will have certain terms that you must meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| Part of this original application was Myrtle Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| Part of these terms state that if for any reason that we are going to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| other than the applied-for-purpose recreation with these lands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| you must seek prior approval and you must prove that you will be giving parkland acre for acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| as part of the terms of this arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| I just want to be clear that the neighborhood has concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| that we don't know why we're being asked to close this still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| and remind Council that per the federal government, you all are still beholden to those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal or questions from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| Thank you, Mr. Salmons. We don't need any rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| You're the only person signed up to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| I just want to thank Mr. Salmons for coming to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| I just want to provide a little context for new Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| I'm sure many of us are very familiar with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| There was a dispute between the city and the neighborhood about the use of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| I just want to thank the neighborhood residents who were so very involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| in coming up with various solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| I want to thank the members of Mayor Rojero's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| A compromise was agreed to in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| Thank you to Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| I know you and many other Council members were part of those discussions and meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| I attended some as a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| I was very pleased that a promising compromise was reached in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| My understanding is that the neighborhood's primary concern was to protect the green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| This compromise protects the green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| My understanding is also that Council and the neighborhood recognize the city's significant need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| for more permanent supportive housing, which I also support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| I would like to thank everybody who was involved in those compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| I believe Bruce Spangler is here from VMC to address the need for why this right-of-way is on the agenda for tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3585)|
| 0:59:55| because it would allow VMC to move forward with their application for financing and tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| I'll let him address any particular questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| I appreciate all the people who have moved forward in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| It's been a long discussion, but I think it's been a healthy compromise, and I hope you'll consider supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| I'd like to defer to our legal counsel regarding the federal rule that was mentioned by Mr. Sammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3618)|
| 1:00:36| I don't have a great deal of information directly on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| I have not been involved in that as directly as Ms. McGraw and Director Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| There is still a question, I believe, as to whether the provisions actually control with regard to those particular properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3644)|
| 1:00:54| At this point, that's about all I can tell you about from my standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| I know at the end of the year, there was a presentation about the standard knitting mill project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3665)|
| 1:01:15| At that presentation, it seemed like this compromise was announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| but was there ever a direct meeting between the city and the neighborhood at the end of the year to go over that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3682)|
| 1:01:30| or was it just an announcement at that standard knitting mill event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| Deputy Brace, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| I was otherwise occupied, and I don't remember if there was a particular meeting about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| I think Dr. Lyons is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| He's going to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| He's been directly involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| I've had little involvement with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3713)|
| 1:02:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| I'm Bill Lyons of 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Yes, we had that meeting, Councilwoman Parker, that you referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| In short, there was never a meeting or an agreed-to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| This was a statement made by Mayor Rojero that she would not pursue any of the use of the three parcels that were in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3733)|
| 1:02:24| and would, in fact, move to include them in the boundaries of Caswell Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| and also move to have that reflected in the one-year plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| I might add also that the right-of-way we're talking about is not part of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| so I don't see how that's affected by anything with the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| We're talking about closing a city right-of-way that was once a street that's long been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| But directly to your question, this was basically a decision not to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| It was an announcement made by Mayor Rojero not to pursue any development of the three parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| but in that conversation and in that statement that we would support Positively Living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| in their provision of affordable housing on the site of the present Positively Living structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| And this request is for eight more feet that would allow them to have the setbacks that they would be needing to develop that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3799)|
| 1:03:28| That's what this is in reference to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| Thank you, Dr. Lyons. Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| Seeing none, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| So, Mayor, after all of this discussion, and I think Councilmember Parker brought up a valid point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| that this was announced as a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| There was no additional opportunity or meeting for public input as relates to the closure of this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3836)|
| 1:04:07| With that said, I'd like to make a motion, and I'm not sure if it's appropriate to do it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| to postpone this for two weeks to have the opportunity to set up a public meeting for further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| and then have it back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Motion made to postpone this for two weeks. Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| And seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| Councilwoman Ryder, I think you had a word later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| I just was going to say, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| If it's going to get postponed to make a meeting happen, I'm not sure that that's long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3876)|
| 1:04:46| So do we want to postpone until four weeks, which would be March 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| It could be that people have a chance to share that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| We're talking about it right now, and that would be two weeks for community members to learn about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3898)|
| 1:05:06| We can also have a separate meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| I think at the end of the calendar year last year, there had been so many meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| I think people were a little meetinged out, but they might have renewed interest in more meetings to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| I'm going to defer to my colleagues for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| I see that Dr. Spangler is here, and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to come up and talk with us a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| what it requires to get financing for this kind of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| Mr. Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Mr. Spangler, if you could come to the podium and answer Councilwoman Welch's questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3941)|
| 1:05:51| Bruce Spangler, 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| I'm privileged and honored to be the CEO of the Volunteer and Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| I guess it was back in February that the THDA had an innovation round for some set-aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| low-income housing tax credits at 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| What makes this innovative, according to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| is the ability to demonstrate that you are sustaining present supportive housing as well as adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| So we initially applied for that, and then we were invited for the major award, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3979)|
| 1:06:27| I think there's one other agency that might be applying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| So we make our presentation on March 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| What makes it innovative is that we are still in the process of trying to purchase Positively Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| We did do our due diligence for 90 days, and then after we did our capital assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| we asked for an additional 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| And also this gave us the window for this application for THD low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4007)|
| 1:06:55| So we were buying the building to sustain permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| Then also we like to add more in that, and we would do a public process in terms of proper zoning for the requirement of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| The other innovation was that the city was a partner with us in terms of giving some property that would make this possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| The other thing that we had been in negotiation with KCDC in terms of project-based vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| And so all of those came together to make this innovative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| We feel like that we have a strong case to present on March 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| But the value of having that eight feet, as Bill Lyons says, really helps with the set-aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4048)|
| 1:07:37| It also helps us when we go to the state on March 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| So to delay that puts it beyond the March 4th because there would be a second reading required on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| So I appeal to you to decide tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| The work you do is incredibly important in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| What I was thinking about when the vice mayor brought up the idea about a delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| I think that is a good idea in the sense that it gives the neighborhood an opportunity to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4086)|
| 1:08:13| I understand the time limit you're under, and we could look at this at our next meeting on February 25th on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4093)|
| 1:08:23| And that way you can go ahead and we can hear about the legal issues that have been brought up tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| make sure that those have been covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| We can give the opportunity for the neighbors to have an opportunity to hear about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| We can hear some more from them on their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| and then we can still vote on this in time for you to go to your meeting on March 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| So if we were able to do that, that wouldn't put you behind on anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| No, because it still required a second reading, which would be the same timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| Just do it on an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| If I could, can I ask the neighborhood representative to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| Would that be satisfactory to you to delay for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| Obviously we are under a time crunch here to be able to meet these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| Well, two things I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| I appreciate you being willing to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Dr. Sprangler and Mr. Lyons have previously gave a false deadline when this was first brought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| so I would caution you to not accept a false deadline or a false sense of urgency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| in order to meet a deadline that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Mayor, you made a comment that there were countless meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| Madam, there was a single meeting, and we received a week's notice from Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| So the issue is that there has been next to no public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| So now we're saying we need to close the road because they need the additional right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| but there's not been a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| So why do you need more right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Because the last plan that we were told was they were going to use the existing positively living building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| So no new right-of-way should be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| So I appreciate the willingness to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| but honestly we've been fighting this for the better part of a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| It's really unfair that we should have two weeks only to gather this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| We've had plenty of times and asked Mayor O'Hara many times for conversation that we weren't given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| Councilman Rivera, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| I think what I heard in the THDA requirements is that the city has to be a participant in getting this tax credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4226)|
| 1:10:36| or they have to contribute something which was, what I understand, going to be the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| That's what the city would be contributing to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| So to me that sounds like why they need the additional property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| because that's the city's piece to qualify for these THDA low-income housing tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4249)|
| 1:10:56| as I understood what Dr. Spangler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| So I think that would be beneficial to talk to the community about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| I do think we can do it on emergency, but it sounds to me like regardless of the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| the city has got to put something into the pot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| or we don't qualify to increase our permanent supportive housing on a site where it already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4276)|
| 1:11:24| They need eight more feet to add some more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| I think that's what I gathered from that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| So I would support a postponement for two weeks as long as we're willing to do an emergency up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| because it's not fair to anybody to keep dragging this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| I just wanted to hold up the email from December 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| and I commended Mayor O'Hara for coming up with a compromise that was workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| Both Councilwoman, or now Vice Mayor, McKenzie and I both spoke at length with many of the community members there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4316)|
| 1:12:07| The issue for me is that I don't want to speak for this council because we haven't had, as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| we haven't had agenda items come up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| But I know from the past council, and I think also for some of you sitting here now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| of creating additional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| And so I thought that what she proposed on the 12th got us in the direction that we needed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| So I think one of the issues right now is not knowing about the financing details that are being worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4353)|
| 1:12:42| and the contingent and the need and the immediance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| What am I trying to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| The urgent need for getting the extra land added to the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4370)|
| 1:12:58| Becky, if you want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| Yeah, I mean, I just wasn't familiar with the tax credit thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| I mean, I'm very supportive of that and looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| and I'm very supportive of what Regero proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| which was putting the units on the positively living parcel and what we could do to expand that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| The closing of Myrtle Street was part of the whole plan that was developed last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4402)|
| 1:13:30| It included the three parcels of open space that would be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| the closing of Myrtle Street that would be added to the whole site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| the acquisition of positively living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| and the adding of units spread out over that entire site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| When the decision was made to leave the green space as open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| and redo the sector plan and the one‑year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| it was understood that additional units would be added to the positively living building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| whether they would be added up, as some people recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| or on the side, as some neighborhood leaders recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| It was understood that they needed that additional space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| So we kept the street closure moving forward for that purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| so that they would have the right of way to enable them the proper distance from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4465)|
| 1:14:34| That was the understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| I feel like it was made quite clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| and the neighborhood did understand that additional units would be added to the positively living site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4479)|
| 1:14:50| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Any further questions for Director Wade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4492)|

| 1:14:57| The motion on the floor is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| Vice Mayor McKenzie, did you want to clarify that the motion would ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| did you want to make it be an emergency reading in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Do we want to make a new, a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| You'd make that motion at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4512)|

| 1:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| So my motion will be to postpone for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| to put it back on the agenda on February the 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| which would, even though it is a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| I think that it's doable to get this word out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| and have additional discussion and input from the community as it relates to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| You all heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4538)|

| 1:15:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| I just want to say that I'm very anxious about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| in part because I'm not going to be here in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| So I just want to say that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| I know every day in our city there are people who are sleeping on the street who are in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| I don't know, Dr. Spangler, there are probably 50 or 60 people who are on the waiting list right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4557)|

| 1:16:14| This conversation makes me so anxious because I just feel like we've been having this same type of conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| not just over the past few months but for the past decade around permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| and every time the issue comes up there are reasons that we can't move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| and many of them are very legitimate concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| I just really implore you, and I'm going to support the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| and trust that there will be an emergency reading at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| and I just hope that we continue the fight forward to make sure that we have housing for people who need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4611)|

| 1:21:56| Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| who formed you from the womb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| I, the Lord, am the maker of all things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| by myself, and spreading out the earth all alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| In the abortion clinics here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| these little children that the Lord is knitting together in the womb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| are being murdered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| Yes, we are saying that murder is happening here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| and at the moment, it is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| Also, in Mayor Kincannon's bio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| it states that at the core of her message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| was a commitment to strengthening neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| and encouraging vibrancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| To this, I would agree that we, in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| need to come together to strengthen one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| to encourage one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| and to keep safe those who cannot speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| We're asking that Knoxville will be a sanctuary city to the unborn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4977)|

| 1:23:00| Next person signed up for public forum is John Ziadon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4980)|
| 1:23:12| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| My name is John Ziadon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| I live at 48 Ankara Court, West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| Some things have come to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Three cars have been burned through arson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| and one through theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| There have been three grocery stores that have been robbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| and one abduction that I went to pilot today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| These are older stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| When I say today, I take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Maybe it was yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| That was yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| They called the police to have me removed off their premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| It was a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I remember what had happened in 1986, the importance of this abduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| The perpetrator robbed my store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| I had a store at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| And I feel like it's very important that law enforcement look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| It's not three cars burned, three stores robbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5054)|
| 1:24:21| and one abduction that the robber-slash-abductor is tied to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5061)|
| 1:24:29| And I feel like it's important that our police department look into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| which I did go to the city police, and they want an exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| It's difficult to get an exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| I know within three months when my store was robbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| and I'm just asking for help to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| Yes, it's an old story, but it is relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| And for a pilot to go ahead and call the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| and escort me off their premises over a simple question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| I feel like there's more to the story that needs to be brought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| That's all I've got to say, and I do thank you, all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| Next person on public forum is Patricia Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5108)|
| 1:25:19| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| My name is Patricia Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| and this is the first time I've spoken at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| But I felt it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| It's pertaining to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| A couple of weeks ago, I went to take the dog out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| and there were cars parked all over my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| in front of our residential homes along the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| And as I took the dog down to Sutry Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| there was only one vehicle parked down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Parking has been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| It was actually brought up in 2005-2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| when we were doing the South Waterfront Vision Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| We, the residents of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| fought desperately to make sure that there was parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| The parking was removed, and actually there's no limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| There's no minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| You don't have to have parking in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| not on Sevier or with any of the businesses that are opening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| There's going to be another issue coming up with parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| I have requested for many years from our original councilmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| during the South Waterfront Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| and I don't know if I can put names in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| but it's gone down the line of every councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| every councilperson for the last 14, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| In the last six years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| I have desperately been trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| that this issue is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| There are four blocks on Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| We're residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| We are SW1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| We are a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| In fact, we're actually an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| Residential parking permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| I spent a lot of time, sent Excel spreadsheets out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| truly want people to understand that with the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| the South Waterfront, SW1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| this four blocks of Phillips is very precious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| and needs to be protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| but we really have to deal with this four blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| pertaining to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Fort Sanders has a major issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| but we're talking four blocks of a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| and we are a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| We are actually older than Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| So I just request, as a resident that lives on Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| knowing that people park in front of our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| to go down to Sevier to either go, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| have a drink at Alliance or South Coast Pizza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| when they have their meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| and they park all over the vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| and along the streets and next to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| in front of our homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| that these people have to be able to park down at Sutry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| or they can use transit, ride bikes, scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| any of that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| but this is a very precious four blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| that needs to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| As SW1, we are only residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| We're not commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| We're not multi-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| We're solely residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| and that actually was clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| when the mobile food truck issue came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| that we were considered solely residential as SW1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| but we really need to get started immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| on the parking issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| for the people that live there on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Many of us have been there 30, 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| so it would be nice if council would look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| I know that between...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| Well, I can go back to Joe Holquist, Nick Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| Gerald knows about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| Stephanie is aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| There's so many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| and all the council people received emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| over all these years pertaining to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| so I would really like, at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| someone stick up and protect the residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| We are a very precious, small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| For public forum is Mr. Greg Duthie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| If you could start by saying your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| You got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| Dr. Greg Duthie, 4505 Plymouth in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| I've been absent from my regular attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| I really miss being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| I think a lot of people, when things don't go well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| have a tendency to complain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| but I would encourage the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| to attend your city council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| get to know these great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| Prior administrations, years back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| I'd get quite frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| and I learned real quick that to get results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| if you keep coming here and complaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| people are less likely to want to work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| so I want to end this meeting with compliments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| I taught a course a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| It was on classroom behavior management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| and it was focused on teachers, public school teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| and the expert in that video we were watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| talked about catching them being positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| It has relevance to parents and to employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| like a mayor or a supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| If you're always catching someone doing negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| it just doesn't motivate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| So I'm going to catch you all being positive, if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| A couple things that I've been thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| was a tree that fell on my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| in a massive storm in the fall at Plymouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| a massive tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Well, I couldn't be there, and the neighbors were frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| and KUB came and cleaned it up and unblocked the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| and I wanted to compliment probably Chad Weth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| or the public service folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| I couldn't be there to be a good neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| and cut it up and remove it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| and the city came there and removed the entire thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| So the city will help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| and I really want to make sure thanks goes out to Chad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| and those that took care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| I also want to say I went to the inauguration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| my first inauguration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| and it was nice because it's one of the few times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| I guess somebody I happened to support won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| in various elections nationally and locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| so that was kind of nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| It was also nice to meet some of the new council folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| and congratulations, and Stephanie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| and a few others that got promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| The only negative was I was 3 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| and 30 seconds past my meter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| and I got a $10 ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| but you know, Mayor, it was worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| It was worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Really had a good time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| and it was really nice to see the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| and probably everybody up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| and some of the folks here support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| It was a nice event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| and I encourage you, public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| to get out and take advantage of these opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| The other thing I've been working on recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| something that one of the other people who spoke mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| about if you see a problem, take care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| get involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| Well, I've been working with Mr. Brace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| and a couple other folks in the city here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| and I saw a need for more affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| and kind of an eyesore that was happening in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| and I thought, well, I'll be a liaison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| and I want to say that it's been nothing but positive support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| by Mr. Brace and others here that maybe aren't here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| and they will work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| The city will work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| Unlike maybe our national scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| there's a lot of dialogue that I've experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| in past council members, and I feel here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| and kind of this bipartisanship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| that we try to compromise and work with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| because it just isn't happening nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| I mean, it's just like that, and it's very frustrating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| and I think it reflects on you, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| and all of the folks up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| that you're willing to try to work with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| So thank you for helping with my tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| Thank you for the continuing effort, Mr. Brace and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| in trying to help resolve a housing, zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| affordable housing issue, and I appreciate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| Thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200211?start=5685)|
