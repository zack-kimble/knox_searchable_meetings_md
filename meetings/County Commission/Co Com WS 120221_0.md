| 0:00:39| You're invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| It's on Mall Road near Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| That's adjacent to the Cracker Barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| So we hope that you will avail yourselves of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Is it in the mall, the parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| It's on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| Near the Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| Near the Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| And are you taking us to the Cracker Barrel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| I will not be here tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| I'm leaving for Nashville this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| Call the mayor to do a cash mob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| Sure he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=58)|
| 0:00:59| A cash mob for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| Buy our lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| A lunch mob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| Lynch mob is what most people want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| I would like to ask that item number 31 with regards to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame RFP be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=69)|
| 0:01:17| I met with the mayor this morning and we feel that would be appropriate to defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| Also, I'd like to withdraw item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| I talked with the folks with the League of Women Voters about the Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| They have a system in place for that, and I think it's a very good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| And so I'm asking that that item be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| Also, there are two items to be added to the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| Resolution R-12-2-904, and at the request of the law director, R-12-2-112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=101)|
| 0:01:50| Are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| I'd like to add a resolution for next week honoring the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| And Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| I'd like to add an item for discussion, the discharge of firearms in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| And also, I'd like to defer for 30 days item number 6 at the request of the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| which is my appointment to replace Commissioner Norman on charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| There are a couple of issues he needs to research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| So we would like to ask that to be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Any other items on the agenda to be added or deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Do I hear a motion that all those need to be added, added, deleted, deleted, and changed, changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| I do have a proposed consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| Let me do that first before we do the approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| Number 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=165)|
| 0:03:13| 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=193)|
| 0:03:28| Would anyone like to have any of those removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=208)|
| 0:03:35| And number 35, too, we can add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| That was the acceptance of new roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| On the item that you just mentioned prior to consent, the one about you replacing me on charter review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| could we have a bit of discussion about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Plus I can offer a name that I had for the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| We certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| So do we hear a motion that those items be approved on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| I want to recognize some of the folks that are in attendance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Our school superintendent, Dr. McIntyre, is here along with Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Also, Chief Deputy Biggs is with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| I see various members of the administration, and we want to welcome each of you for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| as well as Mr. Rice, who is our Chief of Staff in the Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| I want to remind the commissioners that in our workshop with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| we had said that any discussion of any of the education consent items would take place at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| And so we are not taking them off of the agenda, but I just want to see, since Mr. McIntyre is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| does anyone have any questions about any items on education consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| I don't have any questions about items per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| but I did have possibly some questions or a desire to have some kind of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| a follow-up discussion that referenced some of the items that came up in the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| And so that might be, I guess the best way to do that would be to add it as a discussion item today, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=312)|
| 0:05:23| Or is it too late to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| No, if you'd like to add it, sure, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| But in terms of any of the items on the agenda, there's no issues with any of the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| The only thing, if we add that as a discussion item, it puts them at the last of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| And they're here now, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| My questions weren't really, it wouldn't be necessary to refer to Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| or any of his staff for the types of things that I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| These are things that really just pertain to us and how we deal with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| I just want to make sure we weren't holding them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| No, I don't want to hold them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| So, Dr. McIntyre, you're more than welcome to stay or if you'd like to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=368)|
| 0:06:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Jim McIntyre, 912 South K Street, Superintendent of Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| I did just want to mention that I did send over to the commission my recommendations to the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| around future capital priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| There are five different areas that, upon doing our analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| and taking a look at what enrollment trends look like and facilities look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| there were five particular priorities that I've recommended to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| They have not taken action on that yet, but I just wanted to make sure that the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| excuse me, that the commission was aware of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| One is doing some work in sort of what I call the North Central Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| where we'll see some enrollment, slight enrollment increases over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| So doing some work potentially at Adrian Burnett Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| And then another pocket of potential enrollment growth is in what I call the Central West Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| which is sort of Inskip, West Haven, Pond Gap area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| Doing a renovation addition at Pond Gap as a potential solution there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| Some in addition renovation at Shannondale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| Some improvements to a couple of our high schools, in particular Powell High School and Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| And then also one of the priorities that I recommend to the board is facilities upgrades associated with potential magnet schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| So recognizing that moving forward as we think about enhancing our magnet school program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| that there may be some facilities improvements associated with that that might enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| and support the programmatic changes that go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| So I wanted to just mention that to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| And also wanted to mention that as we move forward in the budget discussion and dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| my intention is to provide the Board of Education with a recommended budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| a preliminary recommended budget at their mid-month workshop in March, which is March the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| And my assumption in conversation with Mr. Deakins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| they would be likely then to take up the Knox County Schools fiscal year 13 budget at their April voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| which would end up being the first week in April on the Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| So just wanted to keep the commission informed of where we are and where we're headed for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| So thank you very much for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Sure. Thank you. Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Thank you for the capital data there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| And I was intrigued by the Central West Corridor, I guess, if I can use that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| You were talking about some things at Pond Gap, and there was a phrase in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| I don't have the data in front of me, but you called it community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| Community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Community schools. Okay. What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Yeah, so we're doing a pilot currently at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| And the idea around community schools is to make the school the center of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| to recognize that there are certain things that may happen in a child's life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| or the life of the family of a child that may be distractions to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| So if we can make the school able to help support some of the non-academic issues that are going on in the child's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=554)|
| 0:09:23| so, for example, to be able to help broker health services or dental services or mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| or a variety of different types of perhaps financial or legal services for parents to have an extended day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=570)|
| 0:09:40| to do all of those types of things that we know for some of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| particularly some of our students who are in some of our high-need schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| that they have some of those distractions that might keep them from learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| If we're able to be a partner with the community in addressing some of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| we know that our kids will come to school ready to learn and be able to focus on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| And, therefore, we believe we'll be able to bring them to a place of greater student academic achievement and success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| Is that going on in any schools now or would that be the new initiative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| Yeah, Pond Gap is really the pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| and a lot of the structure right now that's happening there is funded by a very generous donation by Randy Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=614)|
| 0:10:22| who is the CEO at Radio Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| And so there's an extended day component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| There's an after-school component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| But then there's also this notion of how do we make sure that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| or broker support services to kids and families so that we increase the likelihood of their success academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| So it's a great pilot program, a great experiment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| and we believe that this is a model that's been used widely in some other school systems across the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=643)|
| 0:10:52| most notably in Cincinnati, Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| And to some success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| And so we'd like to think about whether this is something that we'd like to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| and perhaps broaden in a variety of school settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| So when we think about a potential addition renovation at Pond Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| not only does that address some potential enrollment issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| and some opportunities to enhance the learning environment there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| but it also allows us some opportunity to maybe think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| and sort of dream about what the ideal physical structure would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| to support this community school's concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| Thanks for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Yeah, my pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Our first item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Item number two is approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Do I hear a motion we approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Page two, item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Resolution establishing a committee to review the education incentive payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| to Knox County elected officials and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| who attain the designation of certified public administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| under the Tennessee County Technical Assistance Services County Official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Certificate Training Program Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| I've gotten with the law director on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| and we've had a few people that we've added to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| Basically, it's going to be open to anybody, any commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| any elected office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| We're waiting on information from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| and we'll correlate that with information from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| And once we have that information, we'll call our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Yeah, that was actually going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Is there any need for a formalized process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=753)|
| 0:12:43| by that I mean there's three commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| there's three representatives from each fee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| Should that be just to maybe take away the appearance of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| being heavy-handed or light-handed for that matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| Is there a need to try to strike a balance on this committee or just open it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| I drafted it like that because that was the last conversation I had with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| But certainly in terms of the diversity of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| in terms of other people and interested people being on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| certainly you can broaden it because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| this committee will ultimately report back to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| So I will craft it however you prefer to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| You know, I'll let Commissioner Smith for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| but I would just somehow get representatives from each entity that has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| stake or that has people who are in this incentive pay program to whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| degree to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| And we're pretty much open to any commissioner, any office holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| any public, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| But I guess I would say should we ask for a member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| Should we be a little more formal or just say come one, come all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| or just say, you know, we would like to have, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| at least two members from each fee office and three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| That way it gets a minimum set of people here that are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| We gave some names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| I've got state representatives are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| And I know the office holders will be well represented, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| Any commissioner that wants to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Sam, we'll have you there if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Yeah, I'd like to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| And it's more than just a fact finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Yeah, it's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| And so I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| I just want to make sure that at the end of the day everyone feels that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| had an opportunity to come and present their point up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| And, Commissioner McKenzie, I'm hoping that we can do it in maybe two meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| and not drag it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Hopefully we can do it one, if not two, three at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Yeah, Larry, I just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Do you envision this committee as giving any kind of recommendation back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| commission or to the administration about this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| It depends what we find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| We may even go and relate it back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| You know, we've got to find out where all the money is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| And that's why we've got state people involved too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| So we'll just make a recommendation with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| And then the committee, whoever it needs to go to, whether it needs to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| administration or county commission or to Nashville, we'll go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| Item number six is a resolution appointing Commissioner Mike Hammond to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Commissioner Tony Norman on the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| I would ask that this be deferred at the request of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Mr. Law Director, you want to weigh in on this and I'll get to Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| I just wanted to verify the intent of the charter at this point, just the 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| because, again, when the charter was written, when this section was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| the composition of the commission changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| So I just want to look at our legislative history one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| I just wanted to relay to the body that, as you might realize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| I'm probably a little bit committeed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| and so I hope this can take place just based on all the committee work that I've done heretofore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=987)|
| 0:16:36| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| We did have somewhat of a problem with determining where exactly I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| with where exactly District 3 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| And so one of my nominees for the review committee had to be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1010)|
| 0:16:59| and we found another one, and hopefully she is in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| Anyway, I just wanted to announce her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Her name is Rhonda Keyes, R-H-O-N-D-A-K-E-A-S,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| and she is a teacher at Whittlesprings Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| We brought that back up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Do we need to vote on it, Mr. Law Director, to defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Is there a motion we defer this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Sorry, I just need some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| If we're appointing Rhonda Keyes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| No, that's another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| That's another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| That votes Monday anyway, next Monday anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| Okay, so who's going to sit at the interim meeting here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| We'll be meeting twice before our next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| I can come to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| I just won't be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| I mean, I'm more than happy to come and listen to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| No, no, this is going to be solved next Monday, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| No, you're talking about Commissioner Norman's appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Oh, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Now, the other appointments will be, yes, we're going to do that today under a separate resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| Do you still have a quorum there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| There will still be a quorum, but I'm more than happy to come and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| On page five, item number 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| resolution authorizing a memorandum of understanding between the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| the Knox County Fire Prevention Bureau, and the Town of Fairgate Fire Marshal's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| to formalize the Knox County Fire Investigation Unit Resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I had received a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| And, Mr. VanDeVate, could you tell us how this will work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| This is essentially just formalizing the existing arrangement between the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| Agreements like this have been in place in the past but had simply been administratively approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| When it came time to renew it, we ran it by Mr. Jarrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| and he recommended that we bring it before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| But it simply outlines the responsibilities of each of the three participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| in the Knox County Fire Investigation Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| We contribute personnel and support those personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| Rural Metro contributes personnel and the Town of Fairgate does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Item number 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Resolution Concerning Taxes and the Disposal of Real Property Owned by Knox County Resolution 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| If you could tell us exactly what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| Grant Rosenberg, Knox County Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Commissioners, this is an item we've been working on for a long time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| And this particular resolution sets the stage for an enhanced process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| by which we dispose of these surplus tax sale properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| Our desired outcome at the end of the day is to get these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| obviously relieve the county of its liability on these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| but more importantly get them into a higher and better use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| This has been a partnership, by the way, between the city and the county and the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| I'm going to let Chad Tindall speak a little bit about this particular resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| and give a little bit of background on the reason behind this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| Thank you, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, Chad Tindall, 10129 Elkhorn Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| When I took over as delinquent tax attorney, one of the things that was apparent was a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| One, Knox County had not had a surplus sale in a number of years and needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| Number two, most of the properties that were purchased at a tax sale by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| are properties that are within the boundaries of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| And in an effort to work with the city and hopefully get a higher price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| I approached the city about having a joint tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| and that is a joint surplus sale of our various government-owned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| In addition, I would also mention that last year the legislature changed the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| and allowed municipalities to have surplus sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Formerly only counties could do that, and we've done that for many years in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| But in discussions with the city, we brought in the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| we brought in Mr. Rosenberg as part of community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| and what we decided is that we needed to have a better process by which to dispose of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| And that is that as opposed to simply taking each of these to auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| for selling them for whatever we could get for them, which has been the practice in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| rather we know that there are properties there that would be beneficial to the other government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| For example, there are properties presently owned by Knox County that would be beneficial to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| In addition, there are properties that we believe that would be certainly beneficial to certain non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| and other interested buyers as opposed to simply putting them up for auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| We want to put those through, as it indicates in the resolution, through a process by which we attempt to have an arm's length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| to go to shaded sale where in some properties we issue a request for proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| and in some properties we may transfer those to the city of Knoxville for them to be responsible for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| because they have a beneficial use, all geared with the idea of, one, returning these properties to the tax roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| and putting them back to a better, higher use and, obviously, relieving the county of liability to continue to mow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| and maintain these properties, which they're currently doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| That's the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| You can see that the county presently owns a number of properties based upon the exhibit attached to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| So what we are hoping to do is for this commission to approve that process, allow us to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| and then what Mr. Rosenberg and I will do is once we identify the properties and the method of disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| we will come back before this body and provide you with a list of properties and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| here are the properties where we believe it's appropriate for a request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Here's a list of properties where we believe that we have an opportunity for a negotiated sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| And here's the properties we think will end up in an outright auction of the properties for the best price that we can get for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| That is a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| It should result in more revenue for the county and is simply a better process going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| Also in cooperation with the city and I would be remiss if I didn't recognize that Doug Gordon is a delinquent tax attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Doug has been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| And Doug and I not only work together, you know, in our sales, in our joint sales, in tax sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| but also in this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| And I'd be glad to answer any specific questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| First let me say I like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| I like the fact that the city and county is working together to do what's mutually beneficial for both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| So thank you both for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| But quick question on will we get any information on appraised value so we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| sometimes it may be appraised high, but we know it's a good situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| It's nonprofit or whatever and it makes good sense and we go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| But it would be good to have some of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| I will mention a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Currently the county does not, for surplus properties, properties purchased at a tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| we've sort of established the value of those properties and it's for no more than the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| because they went through the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| So there's no particular formality of providing that or presently no appraised value requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1451)|
| 0:24:19| One of the things that I would also mention to you that the city presently has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| and I would also mention to each of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| a virtually identical ordinance change is going to be presented to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| We expect and hope for approval this same month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| What you're looking at, city council will also be looking at and hopefully approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| But the city has, during or for the last number of years, had an ordinance that required an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| That provided or put in place a significant obstacle when you had that requirement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| I think that when you've had a property go through the tax sale, no bidders, the government ends up purchasing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| more than a year of redemption period has already passed, no one has redeemed that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| and we deem it now to be eligible for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| If we can, and that is with the help of Mr. Rosenberg and, frankly, the city as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| if we can identify a higher use for that, we're certainly going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| But if it ends up being a property that we identify to you as eligible for auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| I think that given all that's transpired with respect to that parcel of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| you can rest assured that the appraisal is more likely than not less than the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| and the cost and the obstacle of trying to have that procedure in place for some appraisal would be extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Mr. Kendall, I know we're talking about surplus property here, but we've got another problem, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| and I wonder if you all are going to carry this a step further and go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| We've got a lot of properties that are delinquent taxes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| I know I've got a couple pieces out there in my district that I've got three people wanting to buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| but there is, I mean, the back taxes owed on it are just absolutely astronomical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| worth more than what the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| We need to come up with, you know, you talk about getting this stuff back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| We need to be looking at some way of, you know, we could say we've got $30,000 back taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| and, you know, it keeps accruing interest every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| But if we somehow get that wiped off, sell the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| we've got a piece of property that's back on the tax rolls that's going to be putting money back in rather than becoming a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| So I wish you could carry that a little bit further and see what you can come up with on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| Well, I'll take this opportunity, Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| I think you've hit upon an extremely important point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| and that is that we do have a lot of delinquent tax parcels out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Those tax parcels, you know, they've been allowed to accumulate over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| The government, and probably rightfully so, has a very limited means of going and taking people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| We have to go through the tax sale process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| However, I would mention to you that I have last year organized a statewide association of tax attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| We now have a committee working directly with the state comptroller on tax reform legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| that we hope to present to the legislature next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| The committee is currently working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Mr. Gordon, at my insistence, is a member of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I'm the president of that statewide association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| But we are proposing and going to propose to the legislature, because I've talked with a number of legislatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| they are keen on this issue because it's the same in every particularly larger county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| We need to have a better process, a more efficient, quicker process to bring properties to the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| And I won't go into much more detail, but I would be more than happy to meet with you directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| to tell you exactly how we're proposing that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| because I also serve on the local and statewide vacant and blotted properties committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| That committee has the same interests as the association that I formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| and the same interests that I think many of the legislators do as far as preparing legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| or passing legislation that will allow us to get through these tax sales much more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| because of some changes in procedures that we're allowed to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| In other words, the basic premise is to go after the property, not a judgment against the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| Going after the property will get those properties and we will be able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| if my efforts are successful and the association's efforts are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| we will be able to do these tax sales more quickly and start reducing those tax rolls, the delinquent tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| In this case, I've got a very willing seller and three very willing buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| But the only thing standing in the way is $30,000 of back taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| If they owe $30,000, they will be in the next tax sale, and I'll put them through the process that I'm presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| I spent two days last week going through hundreds of thousands of parcels trying to pare down under some neutral criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| based upon amount of taxes owed, and we use that neutral criteria in selecting those taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| to get the most delinquent into the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| But I can assure you they're going to be in the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| But right now, my hands are somewhat tied because I've got to follow the law because there's only a limited way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| that the government can come take that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Good program, Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| I encourage what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Grant, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| How is this different from what we've done in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Well, what we've done in the past, as Chad mentioned, is just simply auction off properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| Also, particularly speaking to this resolution, I don't know if you all recall in the past where the county has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| particularly through a negotiated sale, transferred some properties to Habitat for Humanity, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| We transferred some community gardens in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| In doing those transfers, we had to pay the city's delinquent taxes on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| What this resolution will do, and hopefully what Doug is going to be bringing forward to city council in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| is a joint resolution between the city and the county waiving each other's taxes at the point of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| So we won't have to clear the city taxes that we owe the city on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| We won't have to clear those when we transfer those properties in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| They'll be waived by the city, and we'll do that for the city-owned properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| Again, you know, many times these properties, the value of the property is much less than the taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| So to put it out on the private market and expect to get that value out of the properties or get those taxes, recover those taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1824)|
| 0:30:34| it's going to be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| So this essentially makes the properties more marketable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Are you working with this with the --? I've got questions for Grant right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Are you doing this through the insolvency committee, or are you doing something completely different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| Yeah, this would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| What, Chad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| The insolvency committee that you refer to, it deals with properties that have not been deemed surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| What we're asking is these be deemed surplus, which has a legal significance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| and that is you could sell them for less than the taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| This is the very back end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| These are properties that have already gone through an auction process and hadn't been recovered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| probably because they've been so far upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| This one is, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| And this handles the very back end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| And the other issue we're still dealing with and we're trying to focus in on is a lot of these properties have title issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| So we're trying to get marketable title on these properties as we bring them to an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| So, you know, for individuals that do want to improve these properties, build a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| they'll be able to obtain a mortgage and obtain title insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| So we're still working through a lot of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| And as Chad mentioned, there's a lot of state law that we're working on with our partners across the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| hopefully for next year's session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Tell me again, what's between this and the insolvency committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Chad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Well, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| And one thing I want to mention to you, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| is that what we're dealing with now is a county that has not had a surplus sale in a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| And so we're having to clean up and deal with a number of properties that have been owned by the county for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| We had one about two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| I think it would have been a little more than two years ago as far as a surplus sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| But I can look back at the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| It's been a while because we've accumulated almost 100 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Because I chaired that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| The one thing that I would mention to you is that these are you're dealing with properties that have been purchased by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| go before the insolvency board, and they've not been put in through and deemed to be surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| But because we've not yet passed a period of redemption for any tax sales between that last thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| there may be issues for the insolvency committee to deal with with other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| These are properties that are long past that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| In addition, I would also say that what we will have, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| this takes care of a lot of properties the county presently owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| What we hope to do, and I think Grant can speak to this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| but what we'll do in the future is immediately upon a sale of a purchase by the county of a property at a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| For example, the next time we have a tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| and the county ends up being the successful purchaser at that sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| the county is going to buy it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| The period of redemption starts to run when the order goes down confirming the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| and that's a year that the owner has to redeem it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| But community development will be able to start right then and be able to identify that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| look at what use it may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| and we can begin so that once that year redemption period lapses, we'll go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| the insolvency board will go through the process, and then is it surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| What can we do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| We will have a much better procedure going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| Here presently, we're dealing with a lot of properties that are long past purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Anything to get it back on the tax roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| I'm sorry, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| And then we'll get to Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I just felt I had a specific answer for Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Could you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| My name is Douglas Gordon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| I am an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| I represent the City of Knoxville and the City of Knoxville Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| I am the delinquent tax attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| I've represented the City of Knoxville since June of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| I've held a number of tax sales over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Mr. Smith, to answer your question specifically, what is different here is that when Knox County sold properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| in its surplus property sale, it was able to waive Knox County taxes per authority granted by Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| The City of Knoxville was not able to do that, and so when you sold these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| City of Knoxville taxes still remained intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| The new statute, 675-2508, Part D, enacted on July 1st of 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| now provides a process where the City of Knoxville can adopt that statute and proceed in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| This will allow for a far more efficient process and more interested buyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| knowing that everything over and above what is bid at the surplus sale will be waived by both entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2093)|
| 0:35:03| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Mr. Norman's chair, if you all want to stay in touch with him and his committee, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| I just wanted to add one of the reasons this is so important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| and the city and the county together have been working on this issue for a couple of years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| There was a group that went to a vacant properties conference a couple of years ago and started on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| And one of the most important things to remember is that vacant properties in a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| are the single largest risk factor for a community in terms of drug activity, violent crime, lowering of property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2136)|
| 0:35:46| Those are all more greatly impacted by vacant and blighted properties than any other thing in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| It's that critical to the health and well-being of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| And one of the biggest problems we've had is that we've had this very convoluted method of trying to dispose of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2160)|
| 0:36:08| and keep them from hanging around for, you know, 10, 15 years vacant and blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| So this is really a huge step forward for this group that's been working so hard on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| and I am so glad to see this come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| And thank you so much for doing this work and sticking with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| I think this is a really positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| I appreciate it, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| And I hope to have better news in about a year when the legislature hopefully passes a tax reform bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| The motion is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| On page six, item number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| Resolution requesting the unclaimed balance of accounts remitted to the state treasurer under the Unclaimed Property Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| This is Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Do we have any questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| John Troyer, how much money, again, are we talking about here that we'll be able to reclaim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| Yeah, we're expecting to reclaim just under $9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| And so this is money that's on deposit with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| And through taking this action, we would be asking for that money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Motion is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Item number 32 is a resolution requesting that the county mayor direct the human resources manager to generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| and publish on a quarterly basis a report reflecting Knox County's hiring practices in relation to the county's demographic assistance resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2253)|
| 0:37:42| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I actually wanted to amend this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| I need to make a motion first there, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Okay, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| In addition to the race demographics, I had intended that this also include gender and people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2278)|
| 0:38:08| Any questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| I guess the disabilities, the rest of it doesn't matter to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| but when we're talking about disabilities, are we not potentially violating somebody's medical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| If they want to claim a disability, that's fine, but aren't we also doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| Well, no, because that's a protected class under the EEOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2309)|
| 0:38:39| But when you hire them, you can't ask them if they have a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| It doesn't matter to me as far as I just think we can go a little bit too far with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| I agree that we could go too far, but this is just really basic information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| We already have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Yeah, we already have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| And, you know, under the prior administration, they got a monthly report on these demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| I think it's important information for us to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| but it's not something that's going to create a huge demand in cost or man hours or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2352)|
| 0:39:26| It's just information that we've already got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| I'm just asking for it in a report on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| We just want to be careful, of course, between the Tennessee Human Rights Act and federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| identifying people by name or disabilities is always a danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| but we'll work with the Human Resource Department to ensure that any information garnered can't be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| inappropriately or otherwise compromise the private interests of the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| Mr. Mayor, did you wish to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Tim Burchett, 6401 Air Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| As a matter of fact, all that information is public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| And as long as we do not, as the Vice Chairman stated, we violate anything with ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| I think that's a good idea that we all keep well informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Mr. Mayor, that would be you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| Are we already doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| It's public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| It's public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Sentinel or Brian's blog or anybody can go get that information that wants to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| I think we're already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| I mean, you can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| It's just all you've got to do is call down there and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| And so we have no problem with providing that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| It's public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| If any member of the media were to call right now and ask for that, they would issue that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| I just don't see the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| If it's already out there, I don't see the need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Several years ago, I served on a committee with then Attorney Kathy Quist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| a personnel committee when we had to deal with the ADA when it was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| And I know that we had plenty of rules and regs in place to take care of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| to Mr. Andrews' question or to talk further on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| When you hire, when a person with a disability applies, you have to, if they are qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| you cannot not hire them if there is a way you can provide reasonable facilities and workplace for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2494)|
| 0:41:45| So I think we've got things pretty well covered in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| And if the information is available, you know, I don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| We want to get a semiannual report or annual report or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Yes, I agree, I think, with what Commissioner Brown was saying there at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| I think what this is, I think what the Mayor said, the information is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| What this seems like it's asking for is just cobbled together in a report that's presented on whatever basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| And, you know, I don't know if Commissioner Broyles would be entertained a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| that says something like provided it doesn't violate any, you know, acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| any standing laws or practices with regard to disabilities, which I don't think it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| but that way we could ensure that we're not doing something that's going to violate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2549)|
| 0:42:39| So, Commissioner, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Well, actually, there's not any danger of that because that's not the information we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| We're not asking for any identifying information on any employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| It doesn't include names or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| Joe would not write up a resolution that would do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| So we're safe with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| And the information is out there as a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| It would, like I said, it's my understanding from human resources that it's no trouble to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| And rather than going and requesting every three months that they do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| or requesting information and putting it together, it would be nice, like Sam said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| to just have it in a report that we automatically get every three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| Just all we're doing is asking for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Mr. Chairman, are we doing anything wrong now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| I mean, why change what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| I'm not trying to be difficult, but I just, to me, we're creating more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| If it's public knowledge, it's free knowledge, why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| Maybe it's a question for Lauderdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| I just think if we're not doing something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Jim Birch at 6401 Erchery, in case nobody caught the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| Yeah, I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| I mean, in the old days, back when I was in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| that would cause a group of people to have to compile numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| But basically, from what I understand, they just punch a number and can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| And Commissioner Broyles could have that information for whatever she needed it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| And I understand your point, Commissioner Smith, because a few years back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| that would have taken man hour and there would have been a fiscal note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| or a physical note, depending on where you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| But the truth is it won't, it's, we don't have any problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| We're not trying to cause you any problem, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And Commissioner Smith, I realize where you're coming from on the fiscal end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| But nowadays, it's just pushing a button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| And we can get that out to you just in the blink of an eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| As long as it won't raise my taxes, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Smith, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Wright, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Brown, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| So it's 7-4 approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| On page 7, item number 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| Resolution requesting that the Chairman of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| forward a letter to State Senator Becky Duncan Massey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| and or the Tennessee Ethics Commission for the purpose of requesting the initiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| of a censure proceeding or other available or appropriate proceedings in accordance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| with the Senate rules or the Ethics Commission rules against State Senator Stacey Campfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| And we may want to move this on without recommendation, or we can discuss it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| I don't know what the timeline will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| We'll probably end up having a conversation next week about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| But I guess first let me kind of put this in the proper frame or framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2769)|
| 0:46:19| What I like for this to do is deal with the resolution, simply the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| You know, this has gotten a bit of a media coverage, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| that conversation gets into Senator Campfield's don't say gay bill and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| That's not what this resolution is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| But unfortunately, I hate to have to respond to an accusation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| but one was, I guess, levied against me in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| So I'll respond to this, and I'll put a period at the end of my thoughts about the don't say gay bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2812)|
| 0:47:00| And I have asked the superintendent, if we want to do something separate on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| we can put it on agenda and we can discuss it, you know, to our heart's content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| But that's not what this resolution is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| But since I was accused of something, I feel the need to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| I think the quote was, Commissioner McKenzie wants to teach your children homosexuality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| That's a lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| It's a flat out lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| I am strongly against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| I do not want that at all, period, exclamation point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| I don't think it's the way to instruct our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| I don't think the school is a place for that, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| So that's all I'll say about that accusation levied against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| But, again, the issue at hand is my resolution and it's Senator Canfield's statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2870)|
| 0:47:59| So I'll go through a few things and then I'll turn my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| It's already off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Why are we discussing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| It's a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| I've heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| Lakeshore Mental Health is a state issue, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| 100% is a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| It's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| That facility is a state facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| But it affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| It intimately affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| It's a facility that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| That's why we came out the way we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Similar to that, this affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| This really does affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Just last month we were presented with a lot of information from Gloria Ray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2920)|
| 0:48:51| Sports and Tourism Organization about what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| And a big part of that is touches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| How many times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| I mean, we rank them against how many times does Knox County, does Knoxville get talked about in the southeastern region?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2941)|
| 0:49:10| How many times does it go national?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Is that a good metric to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Yes, that's a great metric to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| But the fact that they're talking about us in positive ways and we're tracking that, that's bringing people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| That's making people a little interested in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| And that's tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Those are real dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| And the economists and the travel people know it's a tried and true fact that when the information gets out there like that, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2972)|
| 0:49:44| It does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| You know, as late as a couple of months ago, we've dealt with, and a good thing, I don't mean dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2986)|
| 0:49:57| we had the History Channel come here and interview some people and we had things going on at the East Tennessee Historical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=2997)|
| 0:50:08| And we got countless e-mails about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| We got countless touches about, hey, this is a good thing going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| It's a national thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| The History Channel is something that's national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| And, you know, at least we forget, you know, we made a big deal in a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| A big deal over this extreme home makeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Why make a big deal over someone getting a house built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| One, it's a great public interest story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| But for the reason to get behind it is because next Thanksgiving they're going to be talking about Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| And we're hoping that that brings an interest to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| So what am I saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| When you have statements going out, false statements, inaccurate statements, unfounded statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3048)|
| 0:50:55| statements that by any, I have not had one person come to me and say, he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| And I don't think you all have either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| He's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| That's how AIDS started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| When those statements make it to the Today Show, when those statements make it to the View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3066)|
| 0:51:14| whether we watch them or not, millions and millions of Americans watch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| And they get a view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| They get a point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| They get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| And that negative information, that negative perception of this region affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| So that's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| This affects our bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| There's a perception out there, an age-old perception of what East Tennessee is and what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| We know it's different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| But when statements go out there, unsubstantiated statements that we don't deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| at least make a general statement about its validity or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| I think we're doing a constituents a disservice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| So, again, at the end of the day, this is about one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| This resolution is about one thing and one thing only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| A yes vote means I disagree with these statements as factual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| And if you disagree with this resolution, what you're saying is I'm okay with these statements being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3137)|
| 0:52:26| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| Take up your last statement first, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Your last statement, you said, I don't agree that this, if we disagree, that we're agreeing with his statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3160)|
| 0:52:51| If we disagree, I think we're saying in this case that you mentioned compared it to, you know, the state institution down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3171)|
| 0:53:05| That's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| We had no, the people of Knox County had no, nothing to do with putting that institution there per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3188)|
| 0:53:17| That was put there by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| The people of Knox County had the, share the responsibility, those who voted for him, for putting him in the place he is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3199)|
| 0:53:30| That's where the correction has to be done is the people who put him there are going to have to take him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3210)|
| 0:53:38| Now, as much as, I mean, we have politicians across the nation that we don't agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| but there's nothing we can do about it because it's not our bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| They might be coming in here making speeches, but we cannot control what speeches they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| The fact is this is not ours to do a censure in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| We start crying wolf too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| You know, we've, since I've been on here, we've had two or three things that we have petitioned the state government about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| But if we've got one going every month, they pretty soon say, well, you know, they're just hollering again up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| throw that one in the wastebasket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| But I think in this case, as I said, this is something for the voters to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| They put him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Well, we might not agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| They put us all up here, and some people might not agree with all of us sitting up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| but still the voters and it's still a republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| I'm not trying to get Stacey voted out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| That's not my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Folks, if he wins 51% or 50 plus 1%, you know, more power to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| That's not my state, my reason for bringing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| I don't want to take him out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| This isn't a recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| This is nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| This is just, if I follow that logic, we elect a person for four years and we have no say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| they can go and lose their ever-loving mind there in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| and we don't have a say until four years later or two years later, be it senator or representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| Every time you see his name out there, it's R. Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3318)|
| 0:55:28| It's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| When you see his name out there, he is a Knox County representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| and we need to manage our resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| That's what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| We are a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| We represent our people and our districts and our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and I guess I disagree with the fact that we can't communicate with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| And, again, if Senator Canfield would have said, look, I had a bad source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| or maybe this source isn't as reputable as sources go, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3358)|
| 0:56:08| then maybe we could have a dialogue about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| But that hadn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| Those statements are just still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| So the representative, the one of two state senators from this region is saying H came from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3374)|
| 0:56:25| I won't quote his quote, but, you know, really unsubstantiated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| So I think this is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| I don't think we're always badgering or pestering our state representatives, our state senators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3396)|
| 0:56:44| but I do think that this is something that is serious enough to say that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3404)|
| 0:56:52| That's not substantiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| That's not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| That's not proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| And that's all we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| It's not taking away any of his rights and responsibilities as a state senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| And, again, if he gets elected again, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| That's not my goal is to, you know, wait four years and get him out of office to start a recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| Hopefully I hadn't come off it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| What I'm saying is those statements have tarnished our ability to present ourselves in a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| and appropriate light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| We're better than that here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| All those against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| So three in favor, eight against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3466)|
| 0:57:58| This resolution was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| A resolution approving the appointments of, to the Knox County Charter Review Committee, Resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3482)|
| 0:58:11| We need some names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| This is Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| What was her name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Rhonda Keyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| R-H-O-N-D-A-K-E-A-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3497)|
| 0:58:27| That is the citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Also, do we have, under item number two, do we have some from the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3509)|
| 0:58:38| Any additional names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| So the citizen member Rhonda Keyes from Commissioner Norman, District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| We have two others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| And these are to be nominated by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| The two I would like to nominate are Teresa Williams and Phyllis Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| And I have their resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Actually, Phyllis has a nice picture of herself on hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| If I could pass these out to the members so you all know who we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Is Williams District 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| And District 3 is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Phyllis Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Phyllis Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| My assistant, Dean Rice, will be handing those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3562)|
| 0:59:44| That's why you're waiting on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Ms. Williams worked with former Mayor Brown and, of course, former Mayor and now Governor Bill Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| And Ms. Nichols heads up the Urban League here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Yes, if I remember right, and I couldn't pull up the e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| were the other ones that there were questions about, were those settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| that they were actually in districts that they're supposed to be representing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Yes, ma'am, of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| I don't know about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Apparently, the ones that were in question outside of there were not the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| We had these two there was a question of, and so we've resolved all those others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3623)|
| 1:00:31| They do live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| I was aware of Tony's in District 3 and then there were several out of your list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| but those have all been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Yes, ma'am, we verified them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| And a lot of these folks, of course, live on roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| and the line depends on what side of the bed they sleep on a lot of times, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3651)|
| 1:01:00| Does this put Margo Klein in now then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| She is not in unless we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| The only way we could do that is take someone else off or have an at-large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| but there's not room for an at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| Any further questions about these three appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| This item was also added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| Resolution directing the Chairman of the Knox County Commission to send a letter to the Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| and Knox County Legislative Delegation requesting that the Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| and appropriate members of the Legislative Delegation direct the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| to release to the aforementioned those portions of the investigation file not available to the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| with the ultimate goal of enacting legislation that serves to remove the Public Records Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| exemption for closed Tennessee Bureau of Investigation files| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| in the matters considered to be of great public importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| This is Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| I ask that this be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| I'll make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| You know, I just have a question for our Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Does the Governor have the authority to do that if a judge has ordered the records sealed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Well, sir, under the Tennessee Open Records Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| those files are generally closed and not subject to public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| However, there is a caveat in the Tennessee Open Records Law that reads, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| that the Governor may request a copy of this file and a committee of the legislative body may request a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| And the ultimate authority would be the Tennessee statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| That actually would be 10-7504, an exception to the confidential record exception of the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| Well, I mean, they can, I guess, from what I understood you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| is that the Governor could request a copy to look at and the legislative committee could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| but can that be released to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| I believe the intent is, I understand my conversation with the Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| is that this could be the impetus to possibly change the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| that in cases of great public importance the Open Records Act could be amended in the event something arises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| that the legislature or the Governor feels merits public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| Is that correct, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| Yes, it's not a vehicle by which you're hoping the Governor gets and then releases it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| It's just that the Governor, if he's privy to it or the legislative body is privy to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| they may say we need to take another look at the Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| That's my understanding of the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| This was also added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| It's honoring the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts, a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| I'm sure there's no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| Are we ready for line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| I believe that concludes our agenda with the exception of the discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| So we're ready to move into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| We'll remind commissioners that we do have a pension board meeting at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| You're invited to stay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| We're going to be talking about UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| And we will have a presentation from the officials with regards to that if you would like to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| That's at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Is that meeting here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| It's in here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| It's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Is the meeting here or is it upstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| It's upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| So it is upstairs because I believe city council needs this chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| So first discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| Item 37 is discussion regarding the hotel motel tax in Knox County's contract with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| Commissioner Shouse, if I might mention one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| I received a phone call today that we as a body needed to be aware of the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| members of the General Assembly had filed some bills with regards to hotel motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| with the intent of basically taking away hotel motel tax from local municipalities and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3949)|
| 1:05:57| it statewide and having the legislature oversee it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Now, I don't know the details of that, but I've asked Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| And I believe, Mr. Jarrett, you informed me that there were at least three bills that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| have been filed with regards to hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Presently, there are three bills that have just recently been introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| The most current information does not provide a full synopsis, but merely the captions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| I have requested the full bills, but we haven't received them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| However, Senate Bill 2663 that's being vetted by Senator Overby is entitled Taxes, Hotel, Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3983)|
| 1:06:31| The caption reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| As introduced, requires that the proceeds collected from hotel occupancy taxes be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| to directly increase tourism in the jurisdiction in which such taxes are collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| And let me just comment that when you do see these terse captions, sometimes it's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| misleading in terms of what the actual effect of the bill will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| You can't often get a good feel for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| And in this case, again, we haven't received the full text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| The second one is Senate Bill 2662, likewise being vetted by Senator Overby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| This one is entitled Taxes, Hotel, Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| It reads, as introduced, limits the purpose of any ordinance enacted by a homeroom municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| or enacted by a private act with regard to an occupancy tax to those that directly increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| tourism within a jurisdiction which they are collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| And the last one reads that there would be a decrease from 5% to 4% of the hotel occupancy tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| to be used towards the promotion of tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| Once we get the full text of those, we'll have a better feel for what their impact could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| both fiscal impact and the actual intent of the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| But I checked about five minutes ago, and it's still not up on the Web,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| and I have my assistant calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| And hopefully we can get a paper copy if it's not uploaded to the Web yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| So just for information purposes, Commissioner Schau set his light on first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| and we'll get to Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I just wanted to preface this by saying I added it to the agenda, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| the day we were all driving up to RT Lodge, so three and a half weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| because I wasn't completely satisfied with the explanations we were given at our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| or the meeting next door nor the meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Some of them were good, but some of them I didn't think were totally justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4098)|
| 1:08:25| And so I know there's been massive media attention on this issue in the last three or four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| and there have been some tremendous changes at the KTSC, as we all know, in the last two to three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| Both mayors have weighed in and asked for change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| and the change has been granted, and there's been resignations from both the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| and the president's office and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| I don't need to want to belabor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| We all know what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| And I was a couple of times vacillating between, well, should I pull this off or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| But I think it would still be good to have it on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| I've got some questions I wanted to ask John very briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| because I know we do have a meeting in 50 minutes, and he did supply all of us, I thought, excellent data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4149)|
| 1:09:16| We had a discussion, as you may recall, last May during the budget hearings about hotel multi-tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| and how it was distributed and so forth, and I frankly sort of forgot a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| I tried to put the data together, but I didn't do that good of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| What John has provided to us, I think, has helped me to see how the cash flow goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| and I would still like, if he would come down, let me ask him a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4178)|
| 1:09:46| And, again, let me also mention I'm not trying to meddle in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| or micromanage something that I think is the mayor's responsibility and charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| and that being to renegotiate this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| The contract is on here to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| I see the mayor has asked that the contract be renegotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| I think it goes on for five more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| The city's is up in two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| The county's is going out a few more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| And I was at the, along with about four or five other commissioners, at the KTSC board meeting Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| and the interim president or chief operating person offered to the board to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4215)|
| 1:10:23| she attempted to say, well, let's do renegotiate it, and they were somewhat reluctant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| I think they voted not to totally open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Nevertheless, I'm not trying to micromanage this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| I would like, I would hope that there would be some quantifiable goals in a new contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| that being numbers that people that are experts in this field can agree are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4241)|
| 1:10:51| as a result of things the KTSC or whatever entity the county is paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| and the city is paying to do that are responsible for bringing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| I'm sorry if I'm not making myself clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| I want to just be able to gauge the production of what the entity that the Knox County taxpayer is paying to recruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| to promote tourism, and also to hopefully encourage them to set benchmarks that are something to work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4271)|
| 1:11:19| and not what were the same or less than you did, you achieved last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Since they are in a reconstruction mode right now, I know Chairman Hammond and myself have both talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| and some of the rest of you all have, too, talked with Ms. Bumpus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| And she feels like that within 30 days they will know a little bit more where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| be able to know a little bit more about what the projections are and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| My suggestion would be rather than have to do this today and do it again next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| defer this for 30 days and get it all on the table at one time where it's all fresh on everybody's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Well, if we, I guess, defer it, we talk about it again in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| I would think that's fine as far as the contract is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| I think that's the mayor's charge anyway and not commission's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| I would still like to ask Mr. Tory about 10 or 15 minutes worth of questions about hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| I think that's going to be a factor in our deliberations during the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| and whatever is decided on the administration and leadership of KTSC, if that's agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| I just got a couple of questions about hotel-motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| I won't drag it out or try to belabor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| If I could, I didn't mean to interrupt Commissioner and Mr. Chairman, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| the contract is approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| And so it does merit a fresh look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| I think you may want to consider looking at the actual composition of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| making it more congruent in terms of the number of commission representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| or county government representation in comparison to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| or to make it more in line with the amount of monies that are actually contributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| So although I think in terms of the fiscal impact, et cetera, John is certainly in that expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| but I think we should continue to talk to them about a contract and renegotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4393)|
| 1:13:21| And I don't disagree with Commissioner Brown's statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| I did meet with Ms. Bumpus I guess a week and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| and I understand the situation she's in and she wants some time to sort through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| And I've spoken with several board members who also want to try to get some continuity established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4412)|
| 1:13:41| and continue with what they're charged to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| Let me ask you a couple of things quickly, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| The 40% figure, we have been giving 45%, but we are required only to give 40% to a KTSC type entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4427)|
| 1:13:57| Right, and I think that's worthy of an emphasis is a KTSC type entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| And so it could be somebody else, it could be more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| It could be the National Tourism Alliance or somebody else that does that type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| But it's for the purpose, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| And so right now the county has voluntarily, or through the negotiation with the KTSC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| provided for above that minimum 40%, but that's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| Is the 40%, is that because of the statute you gave us, the fine print page you gave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| The first two cents of five is 40%, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| And also 40% for retirement of tourism-related bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| Right, and there's some expanded language in that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| And there's also for the retirement of debt related to tourist-related facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| and for the equipping, furnishing, and for the operation and maintenance of tourist-related facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| And we've used all of those different options in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| Is that for our cash flows to debt service to the city for the convention center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| Right, we're doing that for cash flow to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| We did that with the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| And so there's also we do that for the operations of the tourist facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| through the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| We pay the utility bills, the building maintenance, and security for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| Okay, that was your answer to one of my questions in the year 2004 and 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| I see we gave $1.5 million to the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| But that convention center opened in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| Did we not give them debt service in 2002 forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| Right, for the convention center, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| So we gave debt service and paid $1.5 million to Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| Okay, which makes me ask you the question about fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| I see fund balance is in a positive situation and suddenly it goes deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Then when we paid the $1.5 million to Tennessee Theater, does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| Am I reading that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| I don't know that net change in fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| It goes from $400,000 to a deficit of $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| Yeah, we're talking about using fund balance for those purposes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| And that has been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| On the second page of the materials provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| the county in its hotel-motel fund started the year at $544,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| And so we're, through this budget, planning to use $259,000 of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| And so we are projecting through the budget to end the fiscal year at $285,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| And so I think for some of the historicals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| I don't think that I tried to line those up with particular years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| And so any one particular year wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| I tried to have more of a collective, here's 10 years' worth of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Okay, so that's actually the county's fund balance that is impacted somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| Yes, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| That was also another question I had because it went, I see the budget is $5,459,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| but only the taxes projected to be collected, 5.2, and the fund balance of $259,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| So that's to come out of fund balance and then you square up with it at the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| after you see what you've actually collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Yeah, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| If the budget comes in exactly at $5.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| and the county spends exactly according to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| then we would end the year with $285,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| So we're hoping we end the year a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Year-to-date collections have been better than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| but we still have a number of months to go too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Okay, so then let me finish up with one just question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| Is 80% of it earmarked to $40 for tourism-related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| promotional tourism, $40 for a capital-type debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| Right, and you could make the argument that 95% is committed with $40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| for the direct promotion of tourism, $40 for the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| 10% for the city, and then we've given 5% additional to the Tourism and Sports Corp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| and that leaves us 5% at the county's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| Okay, I don't want to be splitting hairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| but wouldn't the 10% to the city be only Hotel Motel's inside the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Oh, it's county-wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| It's county-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Okay, so Hotel and Farragut, they get 10% of the tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4736)|
| 1:19:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| I have to go back and check to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| We say 10% to the city, and I couldn't tell you right offhand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| if we split that with the Town of Farragut or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| but I do know that we split it with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| Okay, I'm not trying to – these thoughts I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| and I just wanted to bounce them off of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| Okay, so you wouldn't be out of line to say 95% is committed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| Right, and through the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| we certainly are starting that and starting those discussions now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| and with the mayor's initiative to renegotiate the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| now's the time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| So I think this is the appropriate time to talk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| Okay, I think that's got most of my stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| If I think of anything else, I'll bring it up again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| Great, so I hope this information is helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| and if anybody wants any other information, we'd be glad to provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| Any other questions for Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| If not, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| We have another discussion item added by Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| and you had one too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| Discussion regarding firearms in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Some several weeks back, based on addresses Chairman Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| and Commissioner Schaust and I received correspondence from a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| speaking to the discharge of firearms in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| The citizen is saying they made a report to the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4848)|
| 1:20:56| It was investigated, and I guess the response to their complaint was nothing was being done improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4856)|
| 1:21:07| Since then, though, the sheriff's office and their legal arm has taken on a more in-depth study of the complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4867)|
| 1:21:18| and is saying that looking at state law or Knox County code, nothing was being done illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4878)|
| 1:21:30| The complaint states that one neighbor is discharging a rifle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| and it's striking the deck or house of an adjacent property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4897)|
| 1:21:47| That's sort of a thumbnail sketch of what we have, I think, before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| The discussion here is I need to know if a commission would like to see those two pieces of correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4913)|
| 1:22:01| and work toward something that we might think would satisfy concerns of safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4921)|
| 1:22:11| The way I look at it, what we have in current code in Knox County is okay or being obeyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4931)|
| 1:22:21| and state law has been used as the rule of guide by the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| and they're finding that there has been no disregard for safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4947)|
| 1:22:35| and that's the only two things that can be used to measure this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| The sheriff's department having done their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| So, do I have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Would people like to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Yeah, you know, I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| I don't know how we would, you know, attempt to pass codes or ordinances on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| I mean, you shouldn't be shooting at somebody's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| I mean, that's, you know, I mean, that's what drive-by shootings are, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| No, let me clarify that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| I'm glad you phrased it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| I believe this one resident or one citizen is firing his weapon at what he would deem to be a safe target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=4991)|
| 1:23:22| in, like, target practice, and the rounds are either missing their target or they're erratic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5002)|
| 1:23:31| and they're firing out in the range, so to speak, is this other person's residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5011)|
| 1:23:41| You know, I would think that there would be some sort of state laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| or something that you can't be shooting people, you know, you can't be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| whether it's accidental or not, I mean, if it's actually hitting somebody's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| you know, that's an issue of public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| And I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| That's the reason I bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| The legal finding within the sheriff's department, though, seems to have gone the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| Since there may be a discussion of this, maybe it would be best that through the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| I get a copy of these three different pieces of correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| and allow people to look at it from that point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| Because we're going to have a difficult time restricting the discharge of firearms in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| Does this mean I can't go turkey hunting anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| And, see, that brings up a second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| There's a definite division here between one person maybe turkey hunting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| and another person maybe not being safe in what they think to be a good target range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| If I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| the attorney general of the state of Tennessee has struggled with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| because we do have most of our firearms laws are preempted by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| That's why our code is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| This is the most recent opinion from the attorney general of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| It said, we reiterate that anyone discharging a firearm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| even when doing so while lawfully hunting or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| must not do so in a reckless manner that places or may place another person in imminent danger of death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| or serious bodily injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| The AG went on to opine this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| It said, law enforcement officers may enforce statutes prohibiting unlawful conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| such as assault, and as you know, assault is putting someone in fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| aggravated assault, putting someone in fear with a weapon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| or reckless endangerment, even if the person is doing so in a lawful hunting or otherwise manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| In other words, what the state is saying is, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| you can go in your backyard essentially and discharge a firearm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| but if you're doing it in a reckless manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| if you're doing it in a manner which endangers another, they can prosecute and they can step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| That's as far as the AG, because the AG goes on to explain for three pages the right to hunting act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| and lawful hunting and lawful discharge and the lack of laws that actually deal with shooting on one's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| They're drawing the line, though, however, if it's so reckless that it puts another in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| But I'd like to see that documentation as well, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| You know, it seems to me from what the law director says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| it sort of gets down to a matter of opinion with the sheriff's office as to whether this was reckless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| or whether there was endangerment to the people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| I mean, if there was, they shouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| It's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| And if it's just somebody that just doesn't like guns, then that's a, you know, to me that's a whole different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| But I don't know how we can legislate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| It's obvious that the state attorney general has had difficulty with it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| I mean, we can look at it, but I don't know what we can do as far as adjudicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| whether the sheriff's department made the right decision or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| I mean, this is going to be a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| And then I don't know if we're going to be able to legislate anything that's going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| anything that can impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5222)|
| 1:27:09| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| Yeah, Dave, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Is the person discharging their firearm, are they aware that they're missing their intended target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| and striking somebody's house, or are they denying that that's taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| or have the two parties not spoken about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| They have spoken through the sheriff's department, and it is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| I had a call late last week, a complaint totally independent of the one Commissioner Wright's referencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| opposite side of town, discharging a gun in a subdivision, a vacant lot, but in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| And the sheriff's office was called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| They came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| I'm just relating what the constituent told me, so it's hearsay, but I'm relating what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| They came and said it was no, he's got a right to shoot his gun, and they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| And I contacted Joe, and he did some research for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| And I called the gentleman back, but he still was very concerned because he said, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| after he shoots the bullet, it doesn't discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| It's going to go this way or that way to my house or over there to that kid's playhouse or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| He was very upset about it, and I just said, well, I'll try to get something focused on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| and I'll speak with the sheriff about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| So I don't know if it's widespread, but I know that's two situations I've had complaints about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| so I would concur that we'd like to put a little emphasis on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| Of course, there's much more restrictive regulations in the city, but in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| I know it is possibly a gun rights issue versus a personal safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| The reason I bring it up is because it has been addressed to me by a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| and I think that we as a collective body need to look at this particular complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| and I'll get the two or three pieces of correspondence that I have through the commission office for everyone to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| before next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| Our next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| Discussion of the joint retreat with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| Mr. Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| After the retreat, there was a couple of items that I thought that we should take some time to reflect on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5363)|
| 1:29:35| One, I think it's promised that Mr. Joyner will have some kind of summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| Do we have any prospect of when that might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| I have sent him a, the last conversation I had with him was about two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| and frankly I hadn't thought any more about it since then, but I will make that a priority to contact him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| I enjoyed the retreat, and, of course, the purpose of the retreat, I think a lot of it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| the retreat was accomplished in the, of course, we don't get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| we sort of, we make decisions with quite a space between us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| and so that, the goal of improving relations between the two bodies I think was accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5418)|
| 1:30:26| or at least started, and whatever was started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| it seemed like it would be incumbent on us to continue that process if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5431)|
| 1:30:38| So that was my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| I just, I hope that as we approach the budget cycle, and I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| and I may be behind here on some things that have been planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| but I know that was one, that was one item that was discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| like how to continue this as we approach this year's budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| Then also there were items that, there were a few items that would come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5463)|
| 1:31:10| especially in the smaller group sessions that I think that we probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| it would probably be helpful to us as a body to reflect on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| I just, I wondered about how we can use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| if we, if the, you know, the summary that we have when we get that from Joiner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5486)|
| 1:31:35| there might be some, I'm hoping that we can continue that process in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| and not just have it this one isolated thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| And then I wanted to hear some comments from you guys about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| We will be having another joint meeting on the budget once the budget is formulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| and so we had said that would be our next joint meeting, so we are going to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| We haven't set a date on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| We're waiting for the final budget to come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| and I think Dr. McIntyre gave us some dates today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| so we'll be working on that and let you know as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| That being school budget and county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| Yes, that's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| Yes, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Thursday at 3.30, I'm hosting a public meeting at the Time Warp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| and John Troyer and company will be there to receive input from commissioners about the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5542)|
| 1:32:30| and to answer any questions that anybody might have about the upcoming budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| I just want to make note that what I plan to do is bring a blank notebook, a pen, listen to comments, suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| We're starting the budget process, and we welcome input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| So that's our contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Thanks so much for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120221?start=5571)|
