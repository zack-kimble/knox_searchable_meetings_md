| 0:01:44| First up is Baker Peters Jazz Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| Wade Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| It's 9,000 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| At the time I did the report, Mr. Brown hadn't been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| He's since come in for his fingerprints, but his background check is not complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| We're waiting on a surrender of the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| I'll recognize Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| I would like to request that we postpone consideration of this beer permit until we have the background check completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| What are your plans for opening your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Are you currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| We're just continuing the operation from the previous ownership without changing any of the systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Mr. Chairman, do you want to explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Well, I mean, you know, the background checks, if it came back and there were issues there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| then, you know, obviously we've issued a permit prematurely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| But, no, they can't be serving beer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| Yeah, but is this a change of ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| Yes, a change of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| And so how are you operating now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| The ownership, the change of ownership hasn't officially happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| Okay, until this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Yeah, that's the main thing is that we make sure that the change of ownership not take place until you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| that you're not selling beer until you have the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Under, yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| So if you're operating under the former permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| would a postponement to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting work for you, which would be in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| That should be fine, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Well, let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| I mean, you all have been on our agenda for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| I mean, you know, you kind of, I hate to postpone this for you, but, I mean, it's also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| you've got an obligation to, you know, to get out and get these things checked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| And, you know, I hope you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| Oh, no, yes, sir, we certainly understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| I mean, we'll do everything we can to make sure it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| So the motion is to postpone, I think it's August 23rd meeting, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| Councilman Bailey seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Okay, and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| August 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Bottoms Up Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| Nathaniel Batts, 2920 Selma Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| Mr. Batts has not been in for processing yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| We're waiting on the Health Department approval and surrender of the former owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| Did you say he hadn't been in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| I have been in Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| I came in Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Health permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Health Department approval and surrender of the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| And in the packet there's a letter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| I was going to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| I think there's a letter in there saying that the prior operator does not want to surrender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| He's been mistreated somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| And that's obviously a civil matter between the owner and the former tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| It's my understanding that you all have entered into a lease agreement with Mr. Baxter, who is here, the owner of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=331)|
| 0:05:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Would you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Do you have a copy of the lease with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| And if that's not, I don't believe that's in our, is it in our packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Could I have a copy of the lease, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| Mr. Baxter, if you wouldn't mind coming up and identifying yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| and just confirming that there is a lease in place with this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| And give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| My name is Robert Baxter, and I have signed a rental agreement with Nathan Batts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=372)|
| 0:06:22| It was effective July 1st of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| And we'll give Mr. Swanson an opportunity to weigh in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| As the owner of the property, is it your position that the former permit holder has no right to be on the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=393)|
| 0:06:43| has no right to conduct business there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Not any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| And it would be my advice to counsel that we don't get involved in the dispute between those persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| And he's gone on the record as saying that the lawful owner has gone on record saying that this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| who is the permit applicant, is in lawful possession of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| And I think it's reasonable for you to accept that as the basis upon which you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| Could I ask a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| What happens with the surrender of the prior beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| I mean, if the person is not willing to surrender it, can we nullify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| How does that work in terms of one surrender before the new one is issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Well, I don't know that I've ever dealt with that before, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| Maybe Wanda or someone can help clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| We actually have that beer permit in our possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Couldn't think of the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| But it has not been signed by the permittee as being turned in or relinquished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| That's why that requirement was on our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| But if we're going to grant another beer permit, that beer permit could not be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| And it would be considered constructively surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| So it goes away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| It goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Are there any other lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| This is in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| I didn't want to speak out of turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| But in my view, the file is complete almost with the exception of the health inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| and the surrendering of the other beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| So I would like to make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Mayor Brown, do you second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Yeah, I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Pending the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=521)|

| 0:08:47| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Concerning the equipment that the former person who leased it, will he be able to get his equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| He was concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Anything he wants, he can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Is it in the building now or where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| I believe it's in the building, which consists, I think, of two tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| And there's some cooking utensils that are at my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=552)|

| 0:10:05| and I wanted to make a draw to your attention that the previous beer permit at this location for Manhattan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| was revoked for nonpayment of tax on July 20th of 2010, which means, I believe, that the year has elapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=612)|
| 0:10:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| I saw a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Has it been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I was going to make a comment after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=628)|

| 0:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| It's the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I'll move to approve a pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Yeah, I just wanted to hear a little bit more about the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| I understand it might be an Irish traditional music place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| No, it's actually going to be live music type, traditional type music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| It's actually going to be a Scottish pub, which I know there's a little gray area in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| but basically a lot of the music that has come to this area is Scotch-Irish based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| a lot of people that floated down the French Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| They were the original settlers that came over from North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| and so our goal is basically provide a place that fills the niche that's not being filled in Knoxville right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=672)|
| 0:11:23| and so that's definitely part of our mission statement, and that's what we're striving to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| and people that I work for, they've done a lot of work on the establishment itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=690)|
| 0:11:39| and we're going through our final permitting and all that stuff as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| When do you think you'll be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Well, we hope to open quietly about the third week of August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| and then kind of get all our kinks more as far as staff and just flow of business ironed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| and then hopefully about middle of the month of September we can open up with the grand, true grand opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=721)|
| 0:12:09| You're live on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=729)|

| 0:19:53| To get our fire alarm system in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1193)|

| 0:20:47| my landlord had not completed the certificate of occupancy for my space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| which causes some complications when you're trying to get a building inspection done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1251)|

| 0:21:39| They've just now started the construction part or the renovation on the inside of it just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| I think with all the storms and stuff, it's kind of hard to find contractors right about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1312)|

| 0:23:17| Is there anyone here from the Quaker Steak and Lube?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1397)|
| 0:23:28| My name is Jeff Edmiston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| I'm representing Quaker Steak and Lube, 5616 Merchant Center Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1409)|
| 0:23:46| I've had two charges of sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| The first one was February the 12th of 2010 to an Alexander Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| He's currently pending diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Then it will be dismissed once diversion is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| The second sale to a minor happened on February 11th of this year to James Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| It was passed with no trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Is there a holiday right around there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| February 10th, February 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| You know, obviously there's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| Well, I'd just like to say we've been in operations for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| I mean, we are a family restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| We operate about 18%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Bar sales were very strict on our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| We've even went back over the policies, had all the employees recertified, had them sign statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| We've been very diligent with our alcohol controls, as well as even on our event nights, such as holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1480)|
| 0:24:49| We have hired the City of Knoxville Police Department for security, and I say security, but to be there at the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| We've been using them for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| So we're extremely cautious on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Over the last 48 months, and I just went through the records when we got this notice, over the last 48 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| we've allowed or let go 13 different employees, watching them not ID, manager going over an ID on the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| And even though all 13 of them had ID on them, but for the employee not following that procedure, has lost her position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| So we take this very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| There again, I'd like to reiterate, we are a family restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| We're not a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| We're not a place that, you know, those big parties or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| But we do take our alcohol services extremely serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| So does it say on there, were they carded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Yes, they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| The last incident, the gentleman was carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| The bartender looked at the card and just didn't register the date as far as he thought he had the correct date on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| So why don't you just, you've got, why don't you highlight some of the stops that you have in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| Well, we put in, we went back through the building, and we've added more signs for reminding you of the date, that you're checking on your IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1561)|
| 0:26:13| So we have them in all service areas, as well as two in each, behind each of the bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| We hold an ABC class now every Wednesday morning at the establishment, and that's done by an outside service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| We've reinforced all of our policies with signatures from the staff on an individual basis since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1587)|
| 0:26:35| It's always been part of our hiring package to take them through a bar class, which really is more about IDing and taking them through the ABC courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1595)|
| 0:26:46| We've put out more flashlights behind a bar for the later evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| It does get a little darker behind a bar with the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| And so we've made sure that we've doubled up on what we have available for the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| So there's always there one that you can shine a light on if you have trouble seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| I mean, I'm almost 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| If I don't have my glasses on, I can't read nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| So, you know, the light really helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| We've also reinforced the termination factor on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1632)|
| 0:27:21| We've also put this out for the guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| We never had it listed before as the statements that we ID or anything as far as for the guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| But we've even put those out where guests are seeing it that they know that the Tennessee state law is that we ID and that you have your ID on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| Is it your policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| I mean, you card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Our policy is to card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| And I realize there's more to it, but we only accept driver's license and state-issued IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| We don't accept military IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| We don't accept passports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| We only accept, as our restaurant policy, as a state-issued ID or a state ID issued with the photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| And I'm sure you all had discussion with the two servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| What was their, I mean, where did it fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| It fell under, one, on Alex nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| We did let him go because, I mean, the excuse was he was real busy and he didn't pay close enough attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| And, really, his sincerity in that, we just did not believe that if I let him stay employed with the restaurant, that that incident would not happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1702)|
| 0:28:33| With James, and James has been with us for eight years, we've never had an incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| As a matter of fact, we have offered in the past, we give rewards for finding fake IDs if you come in and try to use a fake ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| And James has received more awards than any, and I'm not really positive on this, but I'm willing to gamble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| probably if everybody included, James has collected more fake IDs in our establishment for younger people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| With James, we did allow him to stay with us because he did check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| The police officer came in and talked to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| He did check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| He didn't have it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| And I felt that it was partially our fault as bar, as the restaurant owners, that we didn't have adequate lighting behind the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| James is, and there again, I'll say this, James is in his 40s now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| He was a younger man when he started with us, but he's in his 40s and your eyes are going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| So, and I felt it was necessary to add more lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| So I did take part of that responsibility on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| That's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| We'll open it up to Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Yeah, Chairman, I'm pretty well convinced that he's taken this very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| and implemented a number of changes and he's conscientious, seems to be, about his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| And I was going to ask about how many rewards have you given and that sort of thing, but that seems like to be a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| Yeah, probably over the last seven years, we've probably spent up or around $4,000 on rewards for providing fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1793)|
| 0:30:01| And, you know, it's gotten really, you know, the great thing about it is the advancement of IDs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| It's really hard to fake them if there's any damage to them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| We still have, you know, we still have the customers that complain, you know, and you look at them and you think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| I think you're old enough, you look older than me, but your ID's damaged, but we still follow through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| Well, I'd just like to say I appreciate your being serious and adamant about, you know, this not happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| Well, I can grant you I'm extremely embarrassed about being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| I've been in the restaurant business for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| This is the first time I've been into the beer board in Knoxville and I've been here for nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| And I'm extremely embarrassed about having to be here today that we've let ourselves down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1848)|

| 0:31:05| Armanda Martin, 4418 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| Again, there were two sales to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| The first one happened on February 12th of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| The person cited was Melanie Davenport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| She did card the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| She's currently pending, has a dismissal pending the completion of diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| Second offense happened February 3rd of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| You can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| I don't know how to pronounce the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| He did not card the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| His disposition was pass, no trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| What was that last remark mean, pass, no trouble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| I've got the disposition if you'll hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| That's what the judge says when he says we're going to pass this for 60, 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| and if you don't get any trouble in the next 60 or 90 days, it will be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| It is a form of diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Well, so tell us, I mean, you've had two citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| You know, what's your plan here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| We've actually put in place, we actually received one of those beer tech ID calendars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| that's on both sides of the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| All of our cashiers, including me, have attended our beer class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| We locked the door now at 3 from 3 to 5 to prevent any reoccurrences from underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| and for selling to anybody that's under the influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| We also have a monthly meeting to discuss any issues that have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| you know, that we've collected fake IDs and let them look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| you know, let all of our cashiers see that these are fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| We've also used friends and family of ours to come in and try to buy beer to catch, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| our cashiers not paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| So we've also added more stickers to our beer coolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| We do ID, we do card, and then we've got them on the cashiers up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| So we're really, we've put in effect, you know, observe your customer when they come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| and walk to the cooler, if they're stumbling, you know, when they're walking towards you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| when they get to the counter, do you smell alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Look at their eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| If, you know, you can smell it or they're slurring, you know, don't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| If you have any doubt, don't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| Make sure when they present the ID that you look at the person first, then the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| You know, verify the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Is it expired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| And verify authenticity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Make sure that that person on that ID is who's standing in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| How many employees and locations do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| We just have the one there on Western Avenue, and there's five of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2027)|
| 0:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| In the 2010 report indicated that if anybody bypasses the ID check that is prompted in the register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2041)|
| 0:34:13| they will be automatically terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Is that the practice in 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| That is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Now, I just come on board in 2010, and so I can't, I don't know what his policy was before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Well, this was a report from February the 2nd, 2010, and it was after the sale to the minor that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2067)|
| 0:34:36| And I would assume that policy should still be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| In 2011, yet that employee still remains with Raceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| Like I said, I didn't come on board until September of 2010, so the store owner, that's his policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Why did the store owner not come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| He's actually out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| I'm the day shift manager, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| I'm a little bit concerned that not enough has changed to prevent this from happening again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| particularly since the second infraction involved not even checking the ID at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| It's not as though it were misread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| It wasn't even checked at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Heather Sutton is here from the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| Ms. Sutton, did you bring any materials to aid our merchants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| And they're, okay, they're with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| We do have some packets that can be helpful in developing stronger policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Now, I know since the incident happened, he has been to the beer class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| I do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| And I think the packet, Ms. Sutton, involves a video and some other things in terms of putting into place some stronger policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| I, for one, would have liked to have seen the owner here tonight to address this since this is a second infraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| and the ID wasn't checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I wanted to ask about the beer class, the internal beer class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| Well, it's more like a beer meeting, you know, to verify, to go over the ID, how it's looked, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| to closely check, you know, the expiration date, the picture, you know, the height, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| because you'll see a lot of people that, you know, we've confiscated quite a bit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| people four foot and it says six foot on their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Well, obviously that's not them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| So you have that, that's a weekly meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Monthly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Or it says internal beer class and education in every weekly meeting on this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2198)|
| 0:36:48| Maybe it's just a misprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| That was from 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Oh, that's the earlier letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| So, oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Something that I neglected to add before is some of our merchants that sell beer for off-premise consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| like Graceway, have found it helpful to buy some of the new technologies that require entering the birth date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| into the system, that there's a kind of a second fail-safe check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| And I've forgotten all the technologies that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| There's one where you enter the date and there's another one that's even newer that just gives a backup to employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| to make sure that that's checked before it is rung up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| And, again, I would like the opportunity to talk with the owner about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| So let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| I was just going to ask, could we postpone this until the next scheduled beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| and ask that the owner be present so we can see his seriousness and see if he has anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| I think that would be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I'd like to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| And I have one other, just for clarity for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| You said that the person working the register went to class after the citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Not prior to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| After.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| So I would say that that would be reactive rather than proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Do you understand August the 23rd that you all, well, I would assume they'll get a notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| Will they get another notification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| You'll get another notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| So August the 23rd, we'll have you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| And hopefully the owner can be here at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| And I hope you'll express to him or her that, you know, it's a very serious situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| and they need to do their very best to be here at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| Vice Mayor, is that a whole lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| I was just going to add this, that, you know, when it comes to aiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| and really supporting some of these offenders that we do, as Councilman Roddy mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| the Metropolitan Drug Commission has these materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| as well as the police department has put together a list of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| And some of the smaller businesses, more of the mom and pops have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| there's a number of things that they can do, implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| They kind of do it the hard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| And then, again, there's technologies that some of the larger franchises can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| But I think, you know, it's best that we try to be as proactive as we can to support businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| to try to make sure that they prevent this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| So, you know, if we could be a little bit more proactive in trying to provide these lists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| and these tools, I think we'd all be better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| This is just a question, clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Are they allowed to continue to sell during this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Is there any further business to come before this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| If not, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2405)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110726?start=2419)|
