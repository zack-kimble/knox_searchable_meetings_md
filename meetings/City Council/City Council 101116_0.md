| 0:00:00| All right, let's go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| I want to call this November 16th meeting of Knoxville City Council to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4)|
| 0:00:10| Let me ask Mr. Woodhull to do a brief word of prayer and then Mr. Greve to lead us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=10)|
| 0:00:16| the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=16)|
| 0:00:17| If everybody could stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=17)|
| 0:00:20| We could stand and bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=20)|
| 0:00:24| It is in a spirit of gratitude that we convene to conduct the business of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=24)|
| 0:00:33| We're grateful that we have the opportunity to engage in mutual care and mutual listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=33)|
| 0:00:40| and pay attention to one another and in your spirit we will derive at that wisdom that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=40)|
| 0:00:47| will benefit all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| I also pray a special prayer of grace for our colleague Nick DellaVolpe's family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| I understand that he has, there's some health issues that he's dealing with in his family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=57)|
| 0:01:04| and so I pray healing on that member of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Let us pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=80)|
| 0:01:30| Madam Recorder, will you call the roll please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=90)|

| 0:01:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=98)|

| 0:01:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=100)|

| 0:01:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=102)|

| 0:01:44| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=104)|

| 0:01:46| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Let me, before we do the minutes, Mr. DellaVolpe called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| He is going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| He thinks he should be here by 20 after and apologizes for running late, but there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| some issues that Mr. Woodhull mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| Can I get a motion to approve the minutes please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Let's go over the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| Seeing no lights, any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| Seeing no lights, any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| No lights and I don't believe we have any consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| So we will move into Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| I got two things I've got to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Let me do just the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| If you're interested in speaking about an item on the agenda, we have a sign-up sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| You can actually come around the back and speak to Ms. Mitchell here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| I think most people here have been at meetings before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| We have a particular way we like to do things and want to try and let folks know what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Two reports here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| The mayor is obviously not here today, so I'm just going to read these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| First one is the 100 block closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| The 100 block of Gay Street was closed beginning Monday, November 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| So crews can install about two dozen large elm trees along the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| The 200 block will also be closed later during the week for the landscaping effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| The work, the final phase of the Gay Street streetscapes project is expected to take five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| days or through November 19th to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| The trees are 20 to 25 feet high, and contractors will be using heavy equipment to plant them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| in tree wells already installed in the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Second announcement is the 10-year plan public conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| The Office of the 10-Year Plan to End Chronic Homelessness would like to invite the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| to a conversation at the new Harvest Park community building from 6 o'clock until 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| p.m. on Wednesday, November 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| That's tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| New Harvest Park is located at 4775 New Harvest Lane, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| The topic will be the Knoxville Community Development Corporation and how it helps make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| affordable housing available to qualified residents in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| We will pay special attention to housing for people who have experienced homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Deborah Taylor, KCDC Section 8 Director, will present for the first half hour with a moderated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| question and answer to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| I believe that is all of the Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Here's a report from reports from members of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| We go to Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| I would like to introduce a Mr. Eddie Young, who is the publisher of a newspaper you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| have seen called The Amplifier, and he's going to describe this very unique program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| Eddie, if you could come right up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| I believe you're the publisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| To me, this is pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| This is an innovation to really put, well, I'll let you, I won't steal your thunder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| but this is, in my mind, as it relates to working with our citizens who struggle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| homelessness, it's on par with the excellent work of CARM and the catering business that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| they use to really employ people and give them skills and give them some money and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| a hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| So it's very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| I did meet, I encourage all of you, all my colleagues to buy this for a dollar from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| street vendors, and actually, if you're real unclear about the timeline of the 10-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| plan, here it is, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| You can post this up, put this on your refrigerator, and remind yourself of how far we've come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| Eddie, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Let me, before you speak, everybody who speaks should start out by giving your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| We need that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| So please give your name and address and then proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Eddie Young, 8660 Eagle Point Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| Really the amplifier is, I think just as Chris had said, really the primary purpose behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| the amplifier is to turn up the volume on the voices of our homeless community, to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| them to engage in the conversations that are taking place within the community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| affect their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Really, I think first and foremost, we see this as an opportunity to engage with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| community within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| Secondary to that, I would say it's also an opportunity for them to gain a moderate amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| of employment, a moderate amount of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| Obviously, this is not going to put anybody into a two-story house with three cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| This is going to be very, very moderate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| It's going to be perhaps a stepping stone to an exit strategy off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| But really, as far as we see, really the primary purpose behind this is just to engage this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| community back into the mainstream, maybe tear down some of the stereotypes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| held against this community, and allow them to engage in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| It's my understanding that there is a code of conduct agreement with the vendors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| There's a strict code of conduct that we ask our vendors to sign on to, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| Good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| If I could just comment, perhaps, I've been in Nashville the last two days, and I find it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| interesting because I don't know how recently they have launched the same project, and folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| were everywhere, vendors, if you will, selling the paper, and they just offered the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| There was no harassment, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| I mean, we don't want you to buy the paper or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| The timing is kind of, because I just really noticed that, and I thought it was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| a neat program, and they were very well-behaved and good salespeople, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| Well, Nashville has been running since 2007, and Nashville is probably the most successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| paper in all of North America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| There's probably 25 or 30 across North America and Europe, and Nashville is now printing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| over 60,000 a month, and about 35% of their vendors do find themselves into permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| housing as either a direct or indirect result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Now, obviously, the city of Knoxville is not going to be able to match that, but percentage-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| we would like to bring that result to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| We're going to have a smaller rate of success just on numbers alone, but percentage-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| we would like to see our vendors move towards that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| There is obviously going to be, with every sector of the community, you're always going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=540)|
| 0:09:09| to have issues that you have to sort of straighten out and wrinkles that you have to iron out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| but we're prepared for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| They must have recently started because they had bright green signs on identifying themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| You said from 2007, I spent a lot of time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| I've never noticed it, but today I did, you know, very prominent in the community, downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| We're very proud of our vendors, and, you know, we would encourage you just to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| We would encourage the community to engage with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| This is what they're looking forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| I think, really, as we've interviewed our vendors, I think they're looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| as much in just engaging with the community as much as they are maybe making some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| of an income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Is that a question, Mr. Brown, or is it a different announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Yes, I think it's a good idea and wish you success with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| Will your vendors be mainly downtown, or are you going to target most of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| Have you thought about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Well, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| We've put a lot of thought in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Obviously, we need pedestrian traffic, so downtown will be one of our key areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| we'd like to target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| We would really like to find a way to get our vendors out into the West Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| How that works, you know, logistically, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| There's not a lot of foot traffic in West Knoxville, but we would love to see them move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| out that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| There are places on campus where we'd like to see them maybe take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| So primarily downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Eddie, thank you very much for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| First one, thanks to everyone at the city who supported the Veterans Day parade that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| was sponsored by the American Legion Post 2 last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| It was a great event, and we were blessed with beautiful weather for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| And in that vein, I want to make sure that everybody knows that the groundbreaking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| the new Veterans Cemetery for the East Tennessee region will be taking place on the 22nd, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| is Monday of next week at 10 o'clock at the new location, which is out at John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| Highway and the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| It's actually the corner of John Sevier Highway and Old French Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| And the event is open to the public, and I think will be a great event and a start for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| a wonderful new place to honor our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Secondly, there is a letter that I shared with all of my colleagues yesterday and wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| to be public about that tonight when we are all together, speaking to the transition that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| I think all of us are aware that there will be a great deal of transition within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| in the next year as Mayor Haslam moves into his position as the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| And I think we all agree that it's critical that we function as a team during this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| and that we're very open and transparent with our expectations around that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| And I have let you all know that I am withdrawing my name for consideration for the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| of acting mayor or interim mayor for that time period between now and the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| I am a candidate for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| I'm still running for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| There was some confusion about that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| So I am still an announced candidate for that election next fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| But I think the trust that has been placed in us as elected officials is never more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| than during this uncertain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| And I think it's important that we lead by example and that that election process next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| fall proceed very cleanly and openly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| And it's my opinion that the best course of action is that no one come into that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| from a place of incumbency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| And again, this is my opinion and we will certainly debate those things later in a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| But I think that anyone that we might appoint as acting mayor or interim mayor should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| someone that's not interested in running for that position going forward with the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| So I hope all that is clear and conveyed all that to all of you in a letter, but wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| to state that publicly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Let me go to Vice Mayor Becker real briefly for a council operations update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| As you all know, we don't have any more workshop dates set for this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| Our next workshop date is actually January 6, which is just a couple days before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| election of the interim mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| My sense is not to schedule anything then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| So I'm sort of holding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| I don't expect anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| We've not talked about that, but I don't want to bunch us up at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| We have a request right now from the Black Business and Contractors Association for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| We tried to schedule one this fall, couldn't work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell to get an email out to folks checking dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| I'm going to start in February, because my sense would be that there's also that chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| that that next workshop in January, we'd want to be talking about filling the fifth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| I'm going to ask her to get that out, and again, it'll be the traditional questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| of can you make some dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Are you interested in a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| There's also the interesting question of should the current vice mayor schedule something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| that will be in the tenure of the next vice mayor, which I think is a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| So I wanted to let you all know that that would be coming, and we'd appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Madam Recorder, if we can move on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| 8A is a resolution re-electing Nekesha Thompson to the Knoxville Utilities Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Seeing no lights, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Thompson's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Yes, she is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| That's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| 8B is a resolution confirming the appointment of Liz Hanna to the City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Seeing no lights, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| I believe she's here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| And that motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| 8C is a resolution confirming the appointment of Keith Shields as the Field Fleet Representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| and Sgt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Tracy Hanna as the Wrecker Inspector through the Wrecker Services Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Seeing no lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| And that's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| 11A is a resolution approving the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance to Ratty's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Liquor Center relative to its application to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| to renew its license to operate a liquor store in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Seeing no lights, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| And that's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| 11B is a resolution to name the new Knoxville Transit Station the John J. Duncan, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Knoxville Station, requested by Councilmember Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| I don't know if anyone signed up or if anybody from the administration would like to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| but this is to honor the support and to show our appreciation for Congressman Duncan's enthusiastic support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=949)|
| 0:16:00| over quite a bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| We had a number of delays, and he continued to go to work for the appropriations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| and so this is to show him our support and also for all of his work in the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=968)|
| 0:16:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| If not, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| And that's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| 11C is a resolution giving the portion of Hollywood Drive extending northward from Sutherland Avenue to Lowness Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| the honorary name of Pond Gap Road, requested by Councilmember Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| This, too, has gone through the public property naming process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| and it was unanimously approved and recommended by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| This is an honorary naming, so the street will continue to be Hollywood Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| but underneath it will be a historic sign that will read Pond Gap Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| which is what it originally was, and I'm sorry that David Williams isn't here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| so we could get a little of his sense of humor and maybe a short history lesson, but I urge you to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| And that's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| 11D is a resolution requesting and urging the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| and the executive branch of city government to take no action to approve new improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| or uses in any city park other than previously approved capital improvement projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| until such time as city council has received and had an opportunity to act upon currently pending recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| from the Metropolitan Planning Commission concerning appropriate zoning protection for city parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| requested by Councilmembers Bailey and Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| We go to Mr. Woodhull and then to Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I was a little bit confused by this resolution, and I'm sure there's an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1069)|
| 0:17:58| It seemed to me that the administration had already told us that there would be no action on these parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| and so I'm asking, was there some kind of breakdown in communication that we need to put forward this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1085)|
| 0:18:15| I mean, it's been stated in emails and also here in this room that they would not move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| so why do we feel the need to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Yeah, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| During the last discussion, there were a number of citizens who were concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| and probably some distrust in government that something might happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| so I decided just to show them and demonstrate our support that we wouldn't be doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1126)|
| 0:18:56| So it's simply a resolution stating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| I can understand that, but I also want to communicate to Mr. Martin that I heard loud and clear that you were not going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1140)|
| 0:19:12| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| So I hope you don't take any offense to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Vice Mayor, I would just simply state this, that they know that this should be taken in no other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| We're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Just some people out there just don't believe that they can trust their government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| so this is just a simple resolution stating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| And I agree with that, but I also want us to affirm the fact that we have a good relationship with our administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| and this resolution does not indicate any kind of breakdown at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| So that's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| I guess this question is for Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Will this resolution affect the situation in Forth and Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| I believe the neighborhood there requested a change to some land usage there to allow for infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| Will this resolution stop that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| I'll have to look at that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| I need some more detail on the Forth and Gill project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Mr. Lyons, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| I really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| I would have to check as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| I'm going to go to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Yeah, I didn't really get an answer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| I guess as Vice Mayor, I'm going to ask what the situation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| and I don't know if anybody can fill us in on what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| About Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Forth and Gill, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Just real briefly, what is going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Before I go to Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Are you talking about the park, Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| I guess, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| The Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| We were asked by the neighborhood to take that park and declare it surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| and our normal practices when we receive requests like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| we pursue that and go through the normal process that we follow in declaring property surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| and that's exactly what we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| This was not an initiative on the part of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| but it was a request on the part of the Forth and Gill community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Let me go to Mr. Brown, and then Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Would this resolution affect the new interim mayor as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| or would it have to come back with a second resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| I'll ask Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Since this is directed to the mayor and the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| it would apply to the acting mayor and executive branch as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| I'm a little bit uncomfortable moving forward with this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I don't know if it's appropriate to make a motion to move this to the Heel of the Agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| with the Fourth District representative not being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| I mean, he may have a lot more information that was not presented this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| So if it's a proper motion, I will make the motion that we move that to the Heel of the Agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| That is a proper motion, and there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Any discussion on the motion to move to Heel of the Agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| which is actually the last item before public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Seeing no lights, all in favor of moving this to the Heel of the Agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| That's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1359)|

| 0:24:04| between the City of Knoxville and Bell & Associates Construction Company, L.P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| for the Hill Avenue Viaduct Rehabilitation Project to increase the contract price by $321,690.51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1448)|

| 0:24:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| This is obviously a substantial change to this original contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| and I think it warrants Mr. King addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Council will recall I sent an email last week because I realize this is a bit unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| but the situation on this rehabilitation project, the original bridge, the deck was resurfaced with asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| So as our consultant prepared plans and quantities, we weren't able to see the exact deterioration of the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1495)|
| 0:25:05| When we removed the asphalt, we determined that there was more bad concrete that needed to be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| We also found as we began to chip away some of the concrete that was visible underneath on some of the arches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| that there was also more than our consultant had estimated, and we do pay that by the unit costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1520)|
| 0:25:30| So it's just a situation where we uncovered more bad things than we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| and this change order will enable us to do a complete repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| and get this 70-year-old structure back in good shape for a long time in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1547)|

| 0:27:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| I've got questions, and I guess it concerns both J and K together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| Is there a way to, instead of approving one, until we get answers to the two of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| I would ask the questions on the first one would probably be the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| But feel free to ask questions about both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| The concern that a couple of questions that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| and maybe Mr. Martin can help answer some of these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| that in looking into this, especially today, first of all, the L&N train station, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| is an icon that we have here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| It is on the historic register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| And Mr. Harkness and his crew have saved that building for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| and we're all very proud of it, and I know that you folks are very proud of it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| And some concerns that we have that have come up is that, and again, Mr. Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| I don't know if this goes to you or goes to Mr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| one of the major concerns that we have is the maintenance of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| and how the building will be maintained during the 20 years that the city has turned it over to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1702)|
| 0:28:31| A concern that I have, and part of the reasons that I have that concern is, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| that I'm down at Emory Place and we're right next door to the Old City High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| and we've watched that building both deteriorate and get a little bit of improvement and deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| And if you go down and see the building now, a lot of the fascia is loose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| and we're concerned in terms of that building also is on the historic register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| but it's not maintained very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| We've had the opportunity to work on a number of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| and I know that maintenance that they do the best they can with the resources that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| But, again, we're real concerned about the maintenance of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| I'm also concerned that we might be getting the cart before the horse in that we're not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| or we don't have information in terms of how the building will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| I'm sure that some of you are aware that it has to go through a Section 106 review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| This sometimes takes several months for the state to review a historic property and approve what goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| The building, being on the National Historic Register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| both the interior and the exterior of the building is on the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| And so when you start to think about what's going to happen to the waiting rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| and the restroom facilities that might need to be added and the stair towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| again, we don't have any information in terms of how the building will really be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| So concerns that I have before we move forward with this is, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| how the maintenance is going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| Also, several people have contacted me and are concerned about the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| It's my understanding that we're going to have 500 to 800 students at this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| And as it is right now with the tenants that are in the building, there is problems with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| I do know there's city parking around, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| we haven't been given any information in terms of the parking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Same thing goes with the buses in terms of busing students in and out, you know, what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| So, again, I'm personally excited about the idea of a school being downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| I'm not opposed to that in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| My concern is that we have a particular building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| and would just like to have further questions or answers to the questions that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| in terms of how we're going to maintain that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| and actually who owns it after 20 years when the city no longer has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| And is there a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Kim Tran is supposed to be here in a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| There is a way in which we can put a preservation easement on the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| if the city and the Harknesses agree, where that protects the building from a yearly review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| as well as at the end of 20 years that the building can be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| to make sure that it stays with its historical character that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| So, again, I'll address my questions to maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| That would be the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| And I guess, Mr. Morton, do you want to start on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Councilman Grieve, you covered a lot of ground there, so we'll see if we can keep up with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| I apologize for just really getting all this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| Some of those questions are pertinent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Some of those questions are really a matter between the school board and Station 82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1904)|
| 0:31:52| Station 82 partners are the owners of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| I think one of your questions was who would own the building at the end of the 20-year period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| In accordance with the lease purchase arrangement that will be between the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| and the Station 82 partners, for a nominal price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| the school board would own the building at the end of the 20-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| In regard to parking, and I know Mr. Dillingham is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| who's the facilities manager for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| He and I have had discussions about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| The C-2 zoning does not have a parking requirement, but if you follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| and I probably should let Doug answer these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| but with the property is 125 parking spaces, which we think will be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| Again, only the juniors and seniors would have driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| and so they would be the ones that you would be accommodating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| So, Doug, if you would like to expand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| And then in regard to the maintenance, Doug, I guess that's a question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| and perhaps Alex or Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| Go ahead and identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Dr. McIntyre, always good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| I'm Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| I'm 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| I'm superintendent of schools here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| And I guess there are a couple of questions that have been posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| and I'd love to try to address some of them if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| I think Mr. Martin talked about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| We think there is more than adequate parking, 125 spaces at the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| and then really within walking distance a good number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| some 500-plus parking spaces right in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| We don't foresee that being a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| I guess in terms of the maintenance of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| and the historic character of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| I guess what I'd like to say in that regard is we, as obviously you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| consider the L&N Station and Depot buildings to be a treasure for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| And we look forward to, we are required to continue to maintain the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2049)|
| 0:34:18| of the historic nature of those buildings and would plan to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| I think the lease agreement itself will address the issue of maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| and how that will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| But our intention is to make sure that we continue to really honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| that historic jewel that we have here in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| We're excited about the prospect of having a school of the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| in a historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| We're excited about the prospect of continuing the great tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| of a building that's been in our fine city for a century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| And really honoring that tradition and continuing to maintain that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| in the ways that will reflect its historic character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| We're required to do so because it's a historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| It's on the National Registry, as you mentioned, of historic buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| We are in the process of working with the Historic Preservation Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| and making sure that we work with historic preservation officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| to talk with them about our potential plans for that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| if the city council and the school board approve our potential proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| to site the STEM Academy High School at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| And we'll continue to make sure that we work within the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| under the law, but I think beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| I think we recognize the historic nature of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| We recognize the beauty of both the interior and exterior of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| And we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| of that wonderful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| It's a nontraditional facility, obviously, for a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| but we don't intend to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| There's this beautiful large area as you come into the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| that I guess was at one point the waiting area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| and we don't foresee putting up walls in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| and making more traditional classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| We intend to respect the nature of that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| and really create a nontraditional school environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| in that nontraditional building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Do you have a schedule in terms of I know you're trying to open in August, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| That's our intention, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Has the building already been designed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| I mean, has it been laid out in terms of how it's going to be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| We're doing that work right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| We have some folks thinking about the academic program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| and how it fits in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| and doing some cost analyses and things of that nature as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| And my intention, again, if the council approves the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| and we finish that due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| is to bring that forward to the Board of Education at its next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Why, if my colleagues will bear with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| why is it important that we do this now before we get the due diligence reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| and know whether or not the building can actually be used for a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| I think we have a fairly aggressive time frame for getting a school up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| and I believe we do need to do a couple of things in order to make that a viable time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| I think there are two key things we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| The Board of Education has approved the concept of a STEM Academy high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| and if we have time I'd love to just spend a minute or two talking about what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| and what that looks like and what exactly we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| But I think we have to do two things before about the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| One is to secure a facility that we think is viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| There will be some work that needs to be done in order to renovate the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| to build laboratories, to prepare that site to be an educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| I think the other is to hire a great school leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| to hire a principal and put them in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| So this is something that we feel like is an aggressive time frame, but it's a reasonable time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| If we can get those two things done in the next several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| we feel confident that we can open the school for the fall of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| Have you gone ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Have the plans gone far enough to determine, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| restroom facilities and exits out of the building and this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| Again, we're working through all of that as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Our initial look at the building and walk through the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| indicates to us that it's really a very viable site for us to be able to do what we want to accomplish there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| For example, on the depot building, there was a restaurant until very recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| so you've got water and gas available, which is what you need for laboratories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| So that kind of makes a lot of sense there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| We think that the large area on the entry level is going to be a terrific opportunity for us to have a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2338)|
| 0:39:08| for students to do project-based learning, to do a lot of teaming and teamwork around some of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| So we think in terms of the program that we're looking to put in place academically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| we think the site can really fit it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| We're working through the details of all of that and making sure that it meets all of the educational requirements and specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| But at first blush, we think it is a very good fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| Well, going back to the parking issue, I know that the folks at the foundry are a bit concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| especially with the parking situation that they now have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| They've been there for 17 years, and they're a vital part of the community also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| And so they have a great concern over parking, which I'm sure could be worked out in one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| But I think that's one thing that we need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| I think the other thing and the concern that I have, and I'd like for Ms. Trent to talk about this for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| is that I appreciate the fact of what the school board is saying in terms of the preservation of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| And as I said, we all know how important that building is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| and the Harknesses have done a fantastic job of keeping that building going, and I want to thank you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| But what I'm concerned about is that with money being as tight as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| and especially with all that's going on with the school board and the commission at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| and the fact that, unfortunately, what I'm looking at is another historic structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| that you folks have been responsible for for years, which is sitting right next door to me, which is falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| And so I'm worried that there ought to be some way that we can ensure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| if the city is in fact going to enter into this kind of agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| that there's some way that we make sure that this building still maintains the standards that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| And like I said, I'm just concerned because of what I see with the buildings that we now have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| And I realize that that's all part of the economy and what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| But I think that somehow I personally would feel a lot more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| if there's a way in which we can make sure or be ensured that the building does stay in the grand shape that it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| And, Mr. Vice Mayor, I would like to have Kim Trent speak a minute about the possibility of a preservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2471)|
| 0:41:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Were there any last questions for Mr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Not right at the moment, but I would like to hold that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| I guess, do you want to have Ms. Trent come up, or would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Kim Trent, 112 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| I'm the executive director of Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| First, I'd like to say we are always thrilled as an organization when someone proposes a reuse for a historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| We generally don't wait in on what that use is, as long as it's one that protects the historic integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| and is the mother of a math and science geek who won't be able to access the school because he'll age out before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| I think it's a wonderful concept and have no doubt about the good intentions of the current administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| and school board to do this right on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| My concern comes long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| One of the big chunks of my time is spent dealing with abandoned, neglected school buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2532)|
| 0:42:20| and they are wonderful structures that can be great assets to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| but with long term lack of maintenance can become a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And the more lack of maintenance, the more expensive it is to deal with that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| So while I think that they're going to do a great thing up front, as you said, my concern is the long term issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| As an organization, we generally look out further than 20 years, 30, 40, 50, 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| and what's going to happen with these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| And so while I have no doubt the superintendent will take great care of it under his administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| I'm concerned about the limited maintenance budget's long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| and would like to propose if the city is participating in the structure of this financial package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| that it might be a good idea to look at ways to ensure the long term maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| be it through a historic overlay, which would protect the exterior of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| or a preservation easement, which could be crafted to meet the needs of the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| as well as protect the significant historic features on the interior and exterior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| Because we've just seen a lot of buildings phased out after 20, 25 years, and there is no plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| And then we'll have to clean up that mess later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| It would be better to have an easement or some other thing in place that will make sure the maintenance continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| which will save money in the long term and be a much more responsible use of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| Kim, could you give an example of how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Is this an immediate follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Is this for Ms. Trent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Go ahead, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Could you give an example of how a preservation easement might work on the L&E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| It's a commonly used tool all across the country to protect historic places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| Sometimes it's done in conjunction with private equity and financing of historic projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| which may be an option here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I don't know the financial structure, but there may be other incentives available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| and this could be one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| But basically the way I always explain it is it's as if you are giving a painting to the Museum of Art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| but you keep the painting in your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| So you would give an easement to a nonprofit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| You would negotiate at the front end what that easement would protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| and it could be anything, interior, exterior, grounds, whatever the parties come to an agreement about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| The nonprofit accepts the preservation easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| and with that takes on the responsibility of doing an annual inspection to make sure the building is being maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| And if changes are proposed that affect the things agreed to in the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| the property owner has to work with the nonprofit easement holder to come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| If a resolution is not reached or in 30 years someone decides they want to tear it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| or they're going to rip off, you know, whatever important feature is on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| the easement holder does have a legal recourse to enforce their interest in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Let me go to Mr. Becker next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| His light was on before yours, Mr. DellaVope, even though you didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| I guess I have a comment for Dr. McIntyre, who is doing exactly what my comment would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| which is talking to Ms. Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| I think we've had some great experience over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| I know with the Regal Theater there was a sense of at the beginning Ms. Trent just had some wild ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| and they worked out perfectly and they made everything better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| So I just encourage some follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| I think moving forward on this tonight makes a lot of sense to get the process moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| to get your timeline met, because I know it is a very ambitious one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| But that's a very valuable ally sitting next to you there, and you should do the follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| I wanted to ask you in a second, you wanted to talk about the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and I think this is about a school and I want to give you that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| But I have a process question real quick for Mr. Swanson or Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| There's been a lot of changes in this contract and the next one as things go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| The resolution we're adopting actually says having the mayor execute an agreement in substantially the same form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2775)|
| 0:46:24| as what we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| So my assumption is that we're voting on the amended restated loan agreement here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| the stuff that was in our packet, and we're good on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| We don't need to do any amendments to get this done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Am I right on that, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| I agree with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Dr. McIntyre, can you talk for just 30 seconds about the school, about what's central to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| The building is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| It's about an educational opportunity for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| It sure is, and I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| And, by the way, I appreciate the opportunity to stand before the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| I think this is my first time here in my two years, so I appreciate the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| and appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| So the concept is a high-quality, stand-alone, magnet STEM academy high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| and STEM is the acronym that we use for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| We think it's an extraordinary opportunity for our students, and we think it makes a great deal of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| given the incredible regional assets that we have here in our community around science and technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2847)|
| 0:47:35| particularly the flagship research university for the state of Tennessee being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Associated Universities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| and the many technology and engineering companies that we have in our midst here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| We think that STEM education provides a couple different benefits to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| One, we think it's an outstanding platform for a really rigorous education for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| that it allows the opportunity for our students to develop habits of inquiry and cognition and learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| that we think really will put them in good stead, regardless of what they want to do with their future and with their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| And, secondly, we also think it provides some great future career opportunities for our students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| This is a field where the opportunities for students, in terms of their career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| is really burgeoning and growing at a fairly exponential rate, so we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| This is a concept that is in our strategic plan for the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| It's entitled Excellence for All Children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| It's also a concept that's in Tennessee's Race to the Top application and plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| It specifically names a STEM academy high school in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| and allocates $2 million specifically for the purpose of starting up such a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| so there's some resources there that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| In terms of the curriculum, we're really looking at this in terms of kind of two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| In the early years of a student's experience at the STEM academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| they will spend 9th and 10th grade really with an introduction to STEM as an interdisciplinary educational experience for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2951)|
| 0:49:19| Really getting into the application of knowledge in the STEM areas, I think, is going to be a big part of the focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2959)|
| 0:49:27| And then as they get into their 11th grade and 12th grade years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| they'll try to focus on a particular major within the STEM disciplines, a particular area of focus within the STEM disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| And also, we really hope to focus on things like internships and having mentors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| either in a scientist or a business person in the STEM disciplines as a mentor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| and also a lot of dual enrollment and dual credit type of opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| either at the University of Tennessee or at Pellissippi State College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| So we think there are some incredible opportunities for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| We do want this to be a school that is representative of our student body, our student population in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| There's not going to be an exam to get in or any great admission criteria or bars that students will have to exceed to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3011)|
| 0:50:21| We want it to be a representative student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| We want to have, I guess, ordinary students achieve extraordinary results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| And so, again, I appreciate the opportunity to be before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| I appreciate the leadership of the mayor and the partnership, potentially, of the city council in making this happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| and creating what we think will be an extraordinary opportunity for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| And I hope that this hasn't been answered already, but, number one, I wanted to, before I even get to a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| I wanted to thank the superintendent and the school system for looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| I think it's a wonderful opportunity for all the kids in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| and certainly the inner-city schools will now have an opportunity to go to a first-class STEM-type academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| that uses UT's teaching resources and research resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| So I think that's great, and I think it's good that it has access to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| I was going to ask Mr. Martin if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| My understanding is correct that we don't technically have any ownership in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| other than a deed of trust to secure our mortgage or note that is outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| So the ownership is really in Station 82, and the school system is leasing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| and we're going to help by a monetary contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| And for, if this hasn't been said, it's order of magnitude $200,000 a year over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| In my mind, that computes to about $4 million over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| In round numbers, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Yeah, I understand there's a few dollars and cents that are different in that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| but round numbers are easier to understand than all that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Do I understand, and I don't know whether the superintendent knows this or maybe you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| but if for some reason they get tired of this being a STEM school, we have an option at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| a right of first refusal if this building is going to be sold by someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| The grant agreement that is before council includes in there that if after the 20-year period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3138)|
| 0:52:26| and the property becomes the property of the school board, if they cease to use it as a public school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3146)|
| 0:52:35| we have not specifically said a STEM school but a public school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| then the ownership of the property would come to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| or the school board would be required to repay the grant to us, and that condition would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3166)|
| 0:52:56| We finally decided that it was in everyone's best interest to define that, the forever part of that, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3176)|
| 0:53:05| and so it is set at 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| We're talking about 50 years beyond the 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Which is a pretty huge horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| So, I mean, I think the point is that the taxpayers are protected, and I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| So we're making an opportunity that hopefully you guys will take the ball and run with it great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| and we're still protecting the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Mr. Greve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| I'd like to get back to a couple of the questions I had earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| It's my understanding that the school board has approved the concept, but not the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| And then the thing that I'm having a hard time getting my hands around is that I'm not quite sure why we're approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| at this time when we haven't done the due diligence, because my question, I guess, to Mr. Martin would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| if we pass this tonight and they find out the building's not conducive to what they want, then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3232)|
| 0:54:02| Well, all of this, Council Member Greve, is predicated on the fact that it will take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| and that the school board will act at its December 1st meeting and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| If they do not, then none of the transactions will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| And they're targeted to be effective, I think, and Law Director Poplin may correct me here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| but January 1 date or whatever is the reasonable effective date in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| We felt very comfortable that the school board obviously is in support of the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3272)|
| 0:54:41| The facility makes a lot of sense for the very reasons that Superintendent McIntyre has shared with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| We felt it was quite reasonable to bring this forth to Council and to recommend it strongly to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| and that the timing was appropriate to help them as they try to proceed toward opening this school in fall of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3298)|
| 0:55:08| It's a very, as Superintendent McIntyre has mentioned, it's a very tight timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| and so we thought it was appropriate for us to get this step done so that they know that we're willing to support them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3315)|
| 0:55:23| that the building is available and on what terms the building would be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| and then they could work, the school board could then work out whatever the other details that they need to do at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| But everything is predicated on that being their decision to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| Well, then my question would be is what, and I guess this would be to you, Superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| what would be the problem with delaying this for two weeks to give you folks time to work with Knox Heritage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| For instance, I talked to Ann Bennett, who's with the MPC, who's the historian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| and she's not been notified about this project either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| And I just think that what would two weeks do while you're doing your due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| and at the same time you could be working with Knox Heritage in terms of working out some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| that we could be assured that the preservation of the building would be maintained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| Again, Councilman, I think the challenge is the tight timeframe that we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| and the recognition that there are a variety of authorities and bodies that need to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3380)|
| 0:56:28| including the city council, including the school board, including the state fire marshal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| including historic preservation officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| And so it is a complex undertaking with a very tight timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| And so ideally we would have your approval this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| and therefore we could have the discussion with the school board on the 29th of November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| and a vote from them on the 1st of December and begin moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| I mean, we're talking about, you know, some renovations that would need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| We're talking about, you know, potentially having to bid those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| or working through the process with the owner to make those happen as part of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| Either way, that's a time-consuming process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| and we're talking about a timeframe of trying to open by August of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| I just think that any delay potentially jeopardizes the timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| And so, again, I would respectfully request that the city council consider this action this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| And we think, again, we're working through a more detailed programmatic look at the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3452)|
| 0:57:42| but we believe it would serve our purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| We believe that we can make it work within the confines of what we've looked at thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| in terms of the physical space of the building, within the building codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| within the wiring and technology that we want to put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| We believe we can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| And, you know, I think there's going to be two processes that occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| We're working with some folks to do a conceptual sort of programmatic layout of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| but then obviously we need to get to a more detailed design with an architect as we move toward renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| So those are, again, time-consuming processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| and we're looking to move forward on a fairly aggressive timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| I think as an architect, first of all, I think the building can be adaptive to what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| And, again, I want to make sure that people understand that I'm 100 percent behind the STEM school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| But at the same time, I have a real concern that we're kind of jumping ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| First of all, we don't know if the building is really going to work with what we have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| but the other thing is that there ought to be some way that we can ensure that the building will be preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| and somehow have it in writing that it's going to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| I mean, all of us sitting here today can say, yes, we want to preserve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| but we have the resources of Knox Heritage, we have the resources of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| and it seems to me we ought to be able to continue along with what you want to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| But at the same time, some of us could be given assurance by having either a preservation easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| or something like this done to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| And it seems to me that that could happen within the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| I'm kind of putting the pressure on Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| But it seems to me that this is just – it's important, yes, that we open the school, I'm sure, next August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| But it's also important that we maintain a structure that is one of the jewels of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| And I just think that by us saying, well, we're going to do it, I'm a little leery of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| I just would like to see some proof in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| I appreciate that, Councilman, but I would also say I believe we're obligated to do it under the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| and under the regulations that we have for historic preservation in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| and here in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| I don't think we have any option not to do it, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| I think Kim can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Well, she sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| But, you know, as I said, we've met with the Historic Preservation Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| There are some fairly stringent requirements that we have to undergo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| And so, again, both our intent and our obligation, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| is to maintain the historic integrity of the building, and that's what we plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| Let me go to Mr. Brown next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| Dr. McIntyre, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Since you said this is your first time coming to Council, a question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| First of all, I want to say I think the main thing is to have a quality education for our children in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| Are you envisioning a strictly academic school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| or will these young people at this school have an opportunity to participate in different types of extracurricular activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3644)|
| 1:00:52| I know that's something you all will work out, but I'm curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| It is something that we will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| I think there are some tradeoffs to be made with a school of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| And we're in East Tennessee, so I'll address it straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| I don't think we'll have a football team at this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| You know, I think there are some tradeoffs that are going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| You know, I think we are going to potentially have some interscholastic athletics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| perhaps some individual sports or some what I would call not resource-intensive interscholastic sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3680)|
| 1:01:28| But there will be some tradeoffs to be made in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| But I think we intend to ensure that students have a variety of activities that they can engage in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| in addition to the academic component of this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| You know, that's an important part of a high school experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| That's an important part of a school culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| And we want to make sure that that is a critical part of the student's experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| I was not necessarily talking about football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| There are a lot of really fine extracurricular activities that are very important for kids' lives if they're in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3714)|
| 1:02:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| And, you know, a lot of different kinds of extracurricular activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| So other than sports, I really was not thinking about sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| But I'm sure it will work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| And I think it's going to be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Appreciate that, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Let me take a second just to note that School Board Chairperson India Kincaid is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| It's always good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Let me go next to Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Thank you for being here, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Councilman Grieve, I appreciate your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| I've been in a position to open two new high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| One was a ground-up structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| And students were arriving at 7 a.m., and at 5.30 a.m., they were installing the rails on the second-floor walkways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3759)|
| 1:02:48| So I appreciate timeliness of getting things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| And the other school was a renovated school, and the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| We had a drop-dead date that students would be getting off the bus, and things had to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| So I really think that we can probably work out the preservation and other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| and at the same time not slow down the forward movement so that we are at 7.30 on the first day of class thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3787)|
| 1:03:15| what are we going to do because we don't have this done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| So I just wanted to weigh in that time really is important when you have this tight schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| And in both cases, the decision was made much like this with less than 12 calendar months to get the school open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3803)|
| 1:03:32| And that's really a crucial thing that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Let me go to Mr. DelVolpe and then Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Real brief, and that is I appreciate Councilman Greave's interest in historic preservation and architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| and he's devoted his life to those things, and I think it's important that he bring those things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| But as a layman, I think there's no better way to protect a building than to have it occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| and I think someone there to be concerned about whether the pipe leaks or the roof leaks or whatever I think is really a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| And an empty building is more likely to get in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| so I think we're doing a great thing for preservation by getting it occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| I'm not sure how much more Mr. Greave wants to say, but at appropriate time, I'd like to move the question so we can act on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| Let me call on Mr. Greave and then Mr. Bailey, and we'll see what happens then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Well, I agree, Councilman DelVolpe, that we do want the building occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| and I do understand the time schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| I work with schedules every day, so that's not unknown to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| But, again, and I guess, Mr. Martin, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| Do we have the authority to put something like a preservation easement on the agreement that we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3881)|
| 1:04:52| Councilmember Greave, in all honesty, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| That is not something that we have looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Again, just to echo Superintendent McIntyre's comments, they have been very sensitive to this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3898)|
| 1:05:07| to the historic nature of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Certainly, the owners, Station 82, have been all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| I can tell you that I've sat in on meetings that have involved the architect that would be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| Everybody is very sensitive to all aspects of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| Beyond that, though, in fairness, I don't know what that would involve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| and we're certainly willing to explore and look at anything that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| But I think it is important, for the reasons that have already been stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| that hopefully Council will be comfortable with our recommendations tonight and move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| Well, again, I understand everyone's concern and their interest in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| and I understand all of us today saying that what we're going to do is just that we ought to have that in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| We ought to have that down in black and white that says what's going to happen with this building over the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| And let's face it, we're dealing with a government agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| and all of us know what's happening with money and taxes and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| and we don't know who's going to be the next superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| We don't know who's going to be the next school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| But we do today have an opportunity to make sure that that building is preserved and taken care of the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| All of us sitting in this room, I'm sure, are going to say, yes, we can do this and we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| but at the same time, I don't understand why we couldn't put some type of a preservation easement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| I'm not quite sure why we can't continue along your scheduled line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| but at the same time, working with Knox Heritage or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| and if we can get a commitment from the superintendent or the schools that they'll do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| I know I personally would feel a lot more comfortable, you know, with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| And I'm certainly not trying to slow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| It's just that I really want to see this building protected and would like to have my grandson go to school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| But at the same time, I think that we need to have it in black and white on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Let me go to Mr. Bailey and then Ms. Roddy and then Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| I just want to thank all the parties for coming together on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| I did want to recognize one of our own former councilman, Alec Harkness, is here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| And when I met with the administration a couple of weeks ago, my concerns were addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| and I think this is a great use of the building and another attraction downtown, and I fully support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| I concur with Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| I think this is a great project, and I applaud everyone that has come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| And my question for Ms. Trent is, and I guess Mr. Superintendent McIntyre as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| is if some folks would be more comfortable with a more specific delineation of the preservation of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4069)|
| 1:07:58| you know, whether the concern is about specific historic aspects of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| the stained glass windows or the turret or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| could that not be put in writing as we move through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| so that we can allow those who are working on it to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| and move forward on the two items on our agenda tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| And since Superintendent McIntyre has indicated a great deal of agreement with the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| and the spirit of all this, agree tonight that we'll move forward on some kind of delineation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| of those kinds of aspects of the building after tonight, but move this forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| I know the last thing we want to do is slow anything down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| I mean, we're developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| We understand the cost of time and opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| So if we could have, you know, this conversation as it's moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| I think we could work something out as far as an historic overlay, an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| something in writing in the agreement that looks at the long-range plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| because as I said, I have no doubt they're going to do a wonderful thing, and I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| I'm looking, you know, when we're all dead, what's going to happen then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| which is what our job and our role is to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| And the building is currently on the National Register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| That's how it was eligible for the tax credits in the first restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| But National Registry status does not contain the kind of protective measures that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| in terms of specific architectural details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| It's counterintuitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Everyone thinks the feds can come step on your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| It's not really true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| With National Register, it provides incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| It provides protection from federally funded projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| But a private owner could bulldoze it, and there would be nothing that could be done to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| The local historic zoning is the thing that sort of puts protections in place that can be acted upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| or the preservation easement can do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| And though they are receiving federal funding, which triggers the Section 106 review by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| as to what they're doing now, it doesn't go for the lifetime of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| It's just a short-term thing to make sure the current federal dollars are spent in a specific way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| and protected for a specific amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| Well, I think what we all would like to see is all the stakeholders in this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| and everyone who cares about the city and the future of our buildings be at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| and certainly Knox Heritage is an important partner in those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| And I think we've heard a great deal of commitment from Superintendent McIntyre and Station 82,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| and their love of this building has maintained it as a resource for us over these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| And I think what I hear you saying, Ms. Trent, is we've got a good understanding now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| We just want something that gives you and some others a greater assurance, as you said, when we're all dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| And so maybe that's something that we could address concurrently with this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| and be able to move these things forward tonight and then delineate some of the specifics as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| So it would be my intent to support these initiatives tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| I'm confused because Dr. McIntyre said that there is responsibility for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4252)|
| 1:11:00| It's black and white as to what you have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| and then I hear Ms. Trent say that that's perhaps contrary to your statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| and I don't want to get an arm-wrestling match going here, but what did I misunderstand there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4268)|
| 1:11:17| Short term, there is oversight from the State Historic Preservation Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| How long is short term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Short term could be five to 15, 20 years at the most, depending on the specific agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| In private federal tax credit projects, it's just five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| So I'd have to ask about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| On the front end, yes, all the plans will have to be reviewed and approved by the State Historic Preservation Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| There will be a limited amount of time where they have oversight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| I talked to them the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| They suggested that the school system call us, and they're closing out agreements from 15 and 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| So those type of things do sunset, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| So front end, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Short term, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| I'm more concerned about the long-term maintenance and preservation of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| which will require another tool in some form, either a local ordinance through Historic Overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| or an agreement with the owner for a preservation easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| which would provide a federal tax incentive in the form of a deduction equal to the value of that easement to the current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Mr. Vice Mayor, may I just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Mr. Becker, may I just make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Somebody has to actually ask you a question, and Mr. Pavlis has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| So, I mean, that's the part that I was missing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| You know, I don't even want to call it a leap of faith because I don't think it's even to that degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| but I think that there is a will here to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| I think it's a magnificent use of the facility, and it also helps enhance our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| But most importantly, it's a great opportunity for our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| I understand we're the first in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| There are two specific districts that are named in the state's first to the top plan, Metro Nashville and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4384)|
| 1:13:15| So, you know, I'm staying ready to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| and I would hope and fully expect that there would be continued dialogue between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4400)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| I'm going to go to Councilman Becker and ask Dr. McIntyre what he had to say a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| and say that I'm just so trained as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| If somebody stands at the microphone and says, can I speak, I just say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Please, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| No, I appreciate that, and I don't want to circumvent your rules of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| I guess what I'd like to say is, you know, our intention and our commitment is there in terms of the preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4428)|
| 1:13:56| of the historic nature of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| My frustration, I guess, is that this is a concept that we've been talking about for a few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| and the first time I've heard the term preservation easement is this evening in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| And so I guess, again, I would respectfully request that the Council look upon the item that's in their agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4448)|
| 1:14:16| to look favorably upon it, and then for us to find some way to formalize our commitment, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4456)|
| 1:14:24| I don't, you know, we haven't consulted attorneys about, you know, the preservation easement, what the implications are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| So I would hesitate to stand here before you and make a commitment to do that because I don't know the implications of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| But I do feel comfortable saying that we would be willing to formalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| or articulate our commitment to the historic nature of the building in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| We go to Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| This is a question for Mr. Hintz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| How quickly can you work with the superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| Can we meet tonight at 10 or 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| How quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Seriously, in terms of how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Because they have such a tight schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| I mean, I could meet tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Just to address the issue brought up earlier, we have not been included in meetings about the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| and were told by the SHPO's office that they suggested that they talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| And so I didn't realize this was moving as quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| didn't realize that the actual ownership transfer was occurring at a meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| So when I learned the information today, that's why we're here at the last moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| because I definitely do not like to do things at the last minute, but the gate was closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| But I could meet tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| I've been out of town on business the last two weeks, which also complicated it, but I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| So any time they want to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Well, I think we all want to move forward with it, but at the same time, just some assurance as far as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| And I'd also like to ask Mr. Harkness if he has anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| Your wife says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| He's a smart man, isn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| But I guess my question to you would be if you have a problem with preservation easement or however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| what we're talking about in terms of theory, in terms of the preservation of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4570)|
| 1:16:20| Mr. Harkness, I'm going to have to ask you to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| I don't think it's going to be any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| Understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| And that is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Before we go to the next item, a quick point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I had a chance last week to meet with the League of Women Voters Observer Corps that's been watching us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| and reminding me of what it's like to be in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| And I actually have a request for the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| We have a tendency when somebody comes to the microphone, we get a name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| And I want to ask if folks with the administration, when you're asked a question, can just say who you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| so that folks who are watching at home or in the audience know why you're involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Other folks have name tags, and that's point of order for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| Let me go to the next item then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| 11K is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| to provide a grant of approximately $200,000 per year for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| to be applied to Knox County's lease payments for operation of a science, technology, engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| and mathematics high school in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| I have a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| I'll go to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| I have a couple of requests for some amendments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| And I think these are all housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| And actually, I am going to ask Ms. Poplin to explain them because she knows what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| and I would be figuring out as I talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| I think it's more efficient this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| So I'm going to make the motion she's about to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| You'll see a black line resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| While I sent to you the black line version of the grant agreement as we were working on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| I neglected to send you the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| So these are clearly just corrections to match the red line grant agreement that I had emailed to you previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| and that it was included as a clean version tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| And there's one more change in the actual attached agreement itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| and this has been a request that had been brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| The clawback provisions provided that the city could recoup the funds if the school is not open by 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| and we've had the request to change that to 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| So that date would be changed in Section 4.2 and Section 6 of the actual grant agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Are any of those lights on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Is that on the amendment, Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| It's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| We don't have to turn them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| If there are no lights on the amendment, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| So that amendment is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Let me go to Mr. DellaVoppe next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| I just want to be sure I understand one thing, and that is I'm looking at the old one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| because that's the one I read and highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| There was a reference in there on page 205 of the resolution to a maximum amount of $2.9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4756)|
| 1:19:26| and I understood that to be different than the roughly $3.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| Is that now out of the document as a mistake or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| Yes, that has been changed, and it's to reflect the entire amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| Because it's $200,000 a year times 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| The first figure just reflected principal, but principal and interest is now included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| And we did not put a figure just as principal and interest on the underlying note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| which would be equivalent to the $4 million you quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| It was just a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| You've answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| I'm going to ask a Councilman DeLaVoppe question on the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| The $200,000, are we getting $200,000 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| Mr. Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| Oh, you're asking me the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| I thought you were asking Councilmember DeLaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| I'm acting like the Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Oh, like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| I'm sorry, I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| I think I'm supposed to identify myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Larry Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| No, this is a re-amortization of the underlying note for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4823)|
| 1:20:31| So it is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| But this will amortize out, as has been mentioned, the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| which is roughly $2.8 million, $2.9 million plus interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| Is this money we're getting yearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| This is going forward, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| And if you remember, this did not involve city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| This was federal UDAG dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| But as they come back, they come back as city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| So, in effect, there is an opportunity cost to us by choosing to invest it in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| i.e., making the grant to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| But, again, for reasons that have already been stated several times this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| we feel this is a good investment in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| But the money, we have been getting money yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Where have we been spending that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| Well, it just goes into the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| I asked several people all today, and they wanted to know if it was taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Mr. Greve, can you pull your microphone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| I can't even hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Mr. York doesn't trust me with all the answers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| So I'll leave it to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| But it's been, well, anyway, I'll let Jim answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| For the record, I'm Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| I'm the finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| The current, there is currently an outstanding loan that will mature in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4905)|
| 1:21:53| The annual payments under the provision of that loan are slightly over $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| Not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| It's about $400 a month difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| So you're talking maybe $205,000 would be what the current annual amortization would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4921)|
| 1:22:09| As part of the re-amortization, the interest rates are changing slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| because of some of the things we had to do for tax purposes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| But under the new amortization, they will come out to be approximately $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| Mr. Delaveaupe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Before you leave, Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| do we have to make some kind of a budget amendment to deal with the outflow of these dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| as opposed to them dropping into the general budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| This is currently handled in a trust fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| It is our practice that we do not budget trust funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| This is in what we call the KCRF trust fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| So it doesn't affect our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Seeing no other lights, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=4975)|

| 1:23:30| Mr. Delaveaupe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| I see Mr. King in the back, and I don't know if he's the one to answer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| or someone from the police department, but it's good that this is a woman-owned business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| and that we're replacing old equipment that's inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| Is there any saving to be gained in avoiding extra mobilization and demobilization costs of doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5025)|
| 1:23:54| over a three- or four-year period if we do it in small bites of 15 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| And the information we have says there are a total of 72 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| I didn't know if there was some efficiency we're losing by doing it piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| Maybe that's the best way to do it, but I wanted to ask you that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| Cindy Gass with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| The total cost to complete the project was going to be over $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| so we decided to go in increments because it was going to be such a large project with the 72 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| so that was the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| I understand that, and that's kind of an efficient way to parcel it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| and maybe minimize the disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| I think the question was, and I thought maybe Mr. King could answer it, but maybe you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| is some portion of those dollars tied to mobilization and demobilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| and will we incur extra dollars by breaking it into four pieces, I guess is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Mr. King, do you have any notion or not for that type of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Maybe it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Maybe you walk up to the unit and start unbolting something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Steve King, Director of Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| This is not a project that I've been particularly involved in, but looking through the bid proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| I think these items are separately located enough where you wouldn't achieve the economy of scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| that you might think you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| And that was the thrust of my question, so there's no reason not to break it up into workable pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5118)|

| 1:26:31| So it's very similar from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5192)|

| 1:26:34| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5194)|

| 1:27:00| 11Q is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Curved Edge Consulting Company, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| to provide consulting services to promote the City of Knoxville's curbside and drop-off recycling program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| in an amount not to exceed $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Mr. Delvaux-Paye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| I guess, Mr. King, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| I don't know if David's here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| We're spending about $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| I realize it's federal money, but we're all federal taxpayers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| Can you help me better understand what we're getting for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| We're helping ourselves to launch the expected and desired idea of having more curbside recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5252)|
| 1:27:40| I just don't know exactly what these guys are doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| It says develop a clear strategy for implementing the needed improvements to the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| and they're a consulting outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Tell us in layman terms what they're going to do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| David Bray, City Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| And actually, Curved Edge is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| She's in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| And John Homa, who's our project manager, is here as well for public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| They're really going to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| Help us develop a marketing and communication strategy for implementing a new service should we proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| And right now we're still proceeding forward with this new service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| And she's also going to help us develop a marketing and communication strategy for making the needed solid waste changes to our existing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| So those are really her two tasks, the team's two tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| That's going to include everything from how do we market and brand a new service, how do we sign up new customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| how do we market the changes that are going to happen to our existing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| So we have concepts on that, and I know those were presented at the workshop actually December a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| And she's going to actually, Curved Edge and her team, I say she, but Cheryl's in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| they're going to work with us on developing that strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| Do you know if Waste Connections is involved in that strategy development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| I mean, they're the ones that are going to have to implement at least the pickup and service itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| Well, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| This $100,000, which is federal money, is part of really three kind of puzzle pieces that need to come together over the next three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5346)|
| 1:29:15| three to four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| So we're going to work with Curved Edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| We're going to start on the strategy on both marketing the new service and the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| We're also going to, at the same time, be working on developing the request for proposals for the collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| and for the processing of recyclables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| We hope to get that request for proposal out, the RFP out, on the street late December or early December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| That would be ideal if we could get it out then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| That will be out on the street for a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| We'll then get back the actual cost for this new service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| So that's going to happen about the same time we're working with Curved Edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| And then the other piece of that is once we know the true costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| and assuming they fall within the projections we had originally, at some point we have to order the receptacles, the toters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| So those three parts, the strategy, the collection, and the processing costs, and then ordering the toters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| those are all the puzzle pieces that need to come together for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| And, again, our target right now is July 1st is to have something ready to go, a new system in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| assuming that this body, council, and the administration still feel comfortable with the new costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| Are you comfortable we're getting bang for our buck is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| I feel great about our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| Curved Edge is a small woman-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| They teamed up with just an excellent group of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| And I feel great that we've got good value here and feel really comfortable with the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| And we're excited about, we've been talking about curbside recycling, at least I have, for about seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| And I'm excited to actually move on to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| I appreciate your work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| I just want to say I think that if this thing is going to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| it's going to be the marketing and the education and the promotion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| because we're hopefully going to try to change the mindset of people that currently don't recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| So I think this is a very good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| 12A is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northeast side of Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| east side of Keith Avenue from R2 General Residential District to C3 General Commercial District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| this and that antiques applicant third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| We have considered this rezoning for a very long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| Soon it will be a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| And Councilman Roddy at the last couple of weeks, a month ago, whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| suggested that we give one more try to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| So I'd like to recognize the people who are involved in this, the tailors who own the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| Ms. Brummett, who is the leasee, and Ms. Adcock, who represents the Westview Community Action Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| And we have all talked, and they've talked together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| and then I've talked to them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| The bottom line is that the C3 is not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5530)|
| 1:32:17| So what I would like to do is to amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| I think this is what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| I know what I want to do, but I'm not sure how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| I want to amend this to a C6 with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| It would allow the outside sales that Ms. Brummett wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| It would also protect the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| The conditions would be seven items displayed outside no farther than ten feet from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| And we have measured this and know exactly how far out it will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| and the visibility issues that Ms. Brummett was concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| Limiting the number of pieces satisfies the neighborhood that there's not a ton of furniture out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| So with that in mind, correct me if I'm wrong, that I would like to amend this to a C6 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5577)|
| 1:33:05| Mr. Swanson, I'm not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| We first need a motion to approve, and then we can amend after there's a motion to approve and a second on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Now I would like to move to amend the motion to zone this to C6 with two restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5596)|
| 1:33:23| seven items displayed no more than ten feet from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| Proper motion, Mr. Swanson, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Is that a question about the amendment or the motion itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| Substance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| So we'll hold that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Are there any questions about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| If not, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| The amendment is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| Thank you, Mr. DellaVoppe, and I'll come to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| Just wanted to check, Mr. Donaldson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| My understanding is that the staff had actually looked at C6, and so MPC has considered this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| Mark Donaldson, MPC, yes, this has come full circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| The first recommendation coming from the Planning Commission was for C6 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| We're actually following your lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| I'm going to go to Councilman Becker, or Vice Mayor Becker, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| and just say I know Ms. Palmer has recognized the applicant and the neighborhood folks that have worked so hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| I'm going to take a second and recognize Ms. Palmer for her hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| I think when Ms. Roddy suggested that postponement, I think several of us thought it was kind of hopeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| and you pulled it out, and that's a good job, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| Well, thank you, and I want to thank the neighborhood folks, the owners, everybody, because it was a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| We had some robust disagreement at times, but we did get together and hold hands at the end, so it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5685)|
| 1:34:53| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Excellent, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5694)|

| 1:35:35| Well, nope, nope, hang on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| Let's do a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5744)|

| 1:35:46| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5748)|

| 1:35:54| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Councilman Whithull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5756)|

| 1:35:58| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| All right, so that's approved 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| Is this a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| It's odd procedurally, but I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| I remember when this chicken ordinance was debated endlessly before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| There was going to be an initial permit that would expire in December 2010, which is like, you know, a week or two away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5774)|
| 1:36:21| I don't know if we need to deal with that or not, but I just throw that out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| There's going to be some confusion in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| That's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5789)|

| 1:36:40| City of Knoxville Applicant, Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| I know Mr. Lee is here and Rick Emmett is here with the city who is the applicant, but as chairman of the Public Property Naming Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| it had the full, unanimous support of the committee and was recommended by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| And I just want to say, you know, you see Bill Williams in the community so often, and he's involved in so many things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| you almost take it for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| I mean, he just almost blends in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| But he's one of the great Knoxvillians and just works tirelessly for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| and he's just a great credit to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| and I think this is something that will honor him for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| Let's go back to voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| And opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| 12D is in ordinance approving the request of CAD Properties for an amendment to the North City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| for medium-density residential to office for property located on the northwest side of Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| northeast of Smithwood Road, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| We have five people signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| Traditionally, we've heard from the audience from the public first on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| Would you like to do that, or would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| I might like to address that procedural matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Mr. Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| This is one of those that has had some small controversy in its life as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| and I think I'm pleased to report tonight that after looking at the 01 zone that was originally before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5891)|
| 1:38:20| and the discussions that we had amongst the parties, the neighborhood groups, and the property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5900)|
| 1:38:28| that there is a better way to find a zone that works, I think, without controversy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5908)|
| 1:38:37| I hope I'm not mistaken in saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| That's my understanding as of yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| And I would like to move that we take DE and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| I suppose the only one that really ends up having MPC input is 12F, which is the zone itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5926)|
| 1:38:55| As I understand it, the sector plan and the one-year plan that are changes from residential to office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| whether it's 01 or 03, is office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| But I think realistically we ought to send this to MPC to consider the 03 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5946)|
| 1:39:15| It is an office zone that satisfies the needs of the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| and it has some fewer of the kinds of impacts the community was concerned about in terms of noise and traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| I believe that MPC has not technically looked at 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| Others may want to speak, but I think it's fair to say we're all in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| that this works as a zone that will go through uncontested, but we will have to ask MPC to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5975)|
| 1:39:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| If I understand what your motion would be, is it to take all three of these and send them back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| or to adopt the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| Oh, we could just hold E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| We could hold, I suppose, D and F just simply in abeyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| D and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| D is the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| E is the one-year plan, which goes from, again, from medium density residential to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| Hold those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| Ask MPC to look at the zoning question, and we'll just put it on the next docket after they've acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| Just put all three back on the docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| Consider them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| I don't know the technical motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Can you figure out a motion that would do what Mr. Delevaux wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| You could simply move to postpone 12D and 12E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| I said move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| Until the MPC has had an opportunity to consider and make recommendations on 12F for 03| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6035)|
| 1:40:47| and send it back to the city council for its consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| And when they send it back, the law department is automatically going to put D and E on there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6053)|
| 1:41:00| All three of those have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| And for those of you who may not know this, we cannot change the zone unless it's in accord with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| And those are kind of companions to the zoning change that we're working on and are almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| So that is a motion by Mr. Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| You might ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| I don't know if that preacher admits the five or six speakers or not, but that would be the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| I would assume it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| I would next go to public comment unless, Ms. Roddy, you want to go to public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| We have three people lined up to speak in favor of the original amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| I'm going to make a ruling from the chair and allow them to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| I mean, Mr. Swanson, traditionally on something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| the motion is now a motion to send back someplace the people who signed up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| and against the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| I'm going to call them on the original motion, let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| That really would be out of order, Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| You can elect to do that, but really the motion that's on the table right now is a motion to defer items D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6124)|
| 1:42:12| and E until it comes back from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| So the only appropriate thing to discuss before this body at this moment is that motion to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| whether you're for or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| Let me then suggest this, that we ask those people who have signed up to speak if they have comments about the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6143)|
| 1:42:31| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| And we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| They've certainly traveled to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| They absolutely have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| We have signed up to speak against Charlotte Davis and Jamie Rowe and in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6156)|
| 1:42:43| and this is of the original amendment, Lisa Bird, Perry Pratt, and Ricky Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| I'm just going to go with the people who signed up for and ask if there are any comments about the deferral you'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6168)|
| 1:42:59| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Rules on this are that each side may have up to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| Each may speak up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| Please state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| My name is Lisa Bird, and I reside at 5235 Bent River Boulevard, and I am here with my husband, Ricky Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| Lisa, pull the microphone a little closer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Yeah, that is a little louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| We are actually here to request the 01 rezoning for our property at 3403 Towsville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6206)|
| 1:43:35| We have been at this property at 3403 Towsville Pike practicing for over six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| but we've actually been in the Fountain City for over 12, almost 12 years in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| and so we are requesting that we proceed with the 01 rezoning due to numerous factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6230)|
| 1:44:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| Perry Pratt or Ricky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Perry Pratt, 3921 Beverly Place, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| I appreciate you listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| I'm totally impressed by what you all do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| I haven't been here since I was in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| I appreciate your service to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| I'm here to advocate for the birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| I just lend my support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| I have known them for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| They are an asset to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| They have doctored several of my family members, and I just really appreciate them and respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6284)|
| 1:44:52| To tell you a little bit about myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| my family has run a market on the corner just down from the property in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6293)|
| 1:45:01| with the exception of a few years since 1923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| I'm a third generation to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| I've been in business with my dad for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| We've had a great time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| I don't think personally what the birds are asking for is extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| I don't think it's overreaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| In fact, I think it's appropriate, and it just seems like it's a healthy step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6325)|
| 1:45:33| and a growth process for the birds and their medical practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6333)|
| 1:45:42| It's really, like I say, it's an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| So I just want to lend my support to them and somehow just sway you to vote for them, and they're 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6346)|
| 1:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Let me remind folks that the issue before us right now is a deferral of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| so please stick on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| I know it's a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| And Ricky Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Ricky Bird, 5235 Bent River Boulevard in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| Again, thank you all for your time being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| Actually, I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| Maybe you can explain this deferral, what you're just not correcting, but explaining to Mr. Pratt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| I'm not sure I'm clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| Traditionally, questions like this are handled a little differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| and I think it's fair because it does make things a little confusing on what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| Mr. De La Vope is suggesting that we go with an 03 zone rather than 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| 03 will require going back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| The deferral is actually on the sector plan changes to just postpone those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| What I think will happen is it will be later, if this is successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| later making a motion to send the zoning request back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| We can't deal with the 01 zoning if the sector plans have been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| So I believe I'm correct on that, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| This is a procedural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| In effect, Mr. De La Vope is working for the 03 rather than the 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| and procedurally it's going to be over a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| So the deferral is supporting 03, not deferring is supporting not deferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6447)|
| 1:47:36| I hope that helped at least a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| I think it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| One thing I would say then, as my wife Lisa stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| we initially applied for the 01 zoning, which is what we've been working toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| That being said, in the general description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| 01 does provide a buffer zone between the residential area and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| which is exactly what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Also, if the city council members deem it appropriate that we should receive 03 as opposed to 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6477)|
| 1:48:05| then I would respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| Otherwise, I'd have to leave this up to the city council at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| Ms. Davis and Ms. Rowe have signed up, and you're allowed to address again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| The question is the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Procedurally, this is a little odd, but you all have been here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| so I think you might understand a little more what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Ms. Davis, give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| Just maybe I'll understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| I'm Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| I reside at 104 Crawford Road, and I'm here to represent Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| We are in support of Mr. Della Volpe's request of 03 rather than 01 for a number of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6517)|
| 1:48:52| and I won't take the time, unless you want me to, to go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| But we are, as representing Town Hall, I will say that we are in favor of Mr. Della Volpe's request and deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6536)|
| 1:49:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| Ms. Rowe, again, give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pipe, representing the Tazewell Pipe Beverly Station neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| We, too, are in favor of the deferral back to MPC for DE&F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| Let me go to Ms. Roddy and then Mr. Della Volpe, and currently the motion on the floor is deferring both sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6569)|
| 1:49:40| the two-sector plan and one-year plans until MPC is considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| Just another point of clarification with a question for Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| and that is I think everybody on council is certainly in favor, as we saw over Middlebrook Pike, of finding a middle ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| if we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| I guess I want to clarify for everyone involved what we consider when this comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| We can only consider something that MPC has looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| So we're asking MPC to now look at 03, which wasn't talked about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| but when it comes back, because they've also talked about 01, if someone was concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6610)|
| 1:50:16| 01 is still viable, I guess, in that MPC has checked it off their list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| If you send it back to MPC, they consider 03 and either recommend 03 or recommend anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| When it comes back, as long as the record reflects that they have considered 03 and 01, you can do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| You can choose whichever you feel to be most appropriate at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| You just can't change it to something that you can't show in the minutes that MPC has not considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| which would be 03 in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| And please let me state that was simply a procedural clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| and is not meant to be interpreted as my support of 01 or 03 or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| I just want everybody to understand that once MPC has checked those boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| then it opens up our dialogue to a wider format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Thank you, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| I'm going to go to Mr. DellaVoppe, then myself, then Ms. Palmer and Mr. Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| I just want to make sure that there's no confusion by Dr. and Lisa Bird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| because I spent several hours with them as well as with the community representatives looking at 01| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6673)|
| 1:51:19| and whether we could cobble conditions that were going to make it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| and at some point we had an aha that 03 sort of solved a lot of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| and didn't have us getting 01 with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| My procedural motion here is simply to let the package come back up together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| We're not trying to do anything to harm your position in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| but the crucial part is the zone change and these other pieces facilitate a zone change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| and we're just waiting for it to come back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| And that's the only thing that we're trying to accomplish tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| is to get that recommendation or review from MPC and their comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| and then have it all back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| That's what I'm trying to accomplish here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Let me go, again, to Mr. Becker now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| I guess I had some long discussions with the boroughs today about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| and my understanding, I guess, is that there were some discussions about a whole lot of conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6732)|
| 1:52:18| most of which they were willing to go along with, and then this 03 showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| and I know they were a little concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| I guess the question for us really is an 01 versus 03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| and it's interesting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| I spent some time talking to Mr. Donaldson about the difference on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| and I know 03 is designed as more a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| but it actually would work moderately well on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| The one concern I've got that's pretty significant is I know that sign square footage is significantly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6763)|
| 1:52:50| between 01 and 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| 03 allows a whole lot bigger signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| I mean, this could move ten times bigger signage on this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| I'm real concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| I know Ms. Roddy has correctly pointed out that a deferral sending this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| doesn't say anything about which zone we're choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| It merely allows us to choose between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| So I'm not sure what I'd like to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| My gut right now says that 01 is actually a better zone for this property than 03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| especially with some of the conditions that have been talked about by the neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| So I'm not quite sure how to deal with the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| That's why we're asking for the health of the planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| Let me go to Ms. Palmer next, and then Mr. Woodhall and Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| I, too, have had conversations with the Byrds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| This is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| If there is a deferral or if we send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| can you give me a timeline when this would come back to City Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| Mark Donaldson, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| We will be able to advertise this for our December 9th Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6838)|
| 1:54:04| which would then put it back to City Council in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Mr. Woodhall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| I agree with Councilman Becker about 01 perhaps being a better zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| but I did also spend a good bit of time with the Byrds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| and I appreciate meeting you all and discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| And they were also very complimentary about your work, Councilman Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| about being there and convening the interest groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| And I was curious to know, did you feel like, is your suggestion derived from a mutual benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| You feel like those meetings got to a point where this recommendation is serving both interests of the Byrds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6880)|
| 1:54:48| and the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| The answer is generally yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| And we spent a lot of time looking at fashioning conditions that might be imposed on an 01 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| and some of them parties were in accord with and others they were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| And, of course, this body is an MPC's body to fashion conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| But when we got to 03, what I thought we had achieved at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| and maybe I've misinterpreted them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| but what I thought we've achieved is that the primary uses that they were interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| the medical and dental offices, the possible use, if they ever decided to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| for a beauty parlor, a school, an assisted living, were all available under 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| But some of the things that were objectionable, you know, like private clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| and those kinds of things that are in 01 would not be on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| And it made for a comfort level, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| that this was going to continue to be the contribution to the community it presently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| You know, the zoning goes with the land, and we were concerned about uses in the future and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| And so this was a way I thought that it was productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| and that we were getting a lot closer to a workable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| Good. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| Mr. Bailey and then Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| Mr. Donaldson, what will this do if we send this back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6966)|
| 1:56:13| Having done this, when you look at the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| and what they consider to be appropriate, 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| and the compatibility with surrounding development and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| and it's a logical extension of that, and a 13-0 vote, what would we expect to see different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6986)|
| 1:56:36| Probably not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| Both 01 and 03 would be consistent with the office land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| of the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| As far as that's concerned, both are treated equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| When you compare the development regulations of 01 to 03, they're pretty comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7011)|
| 1:56:59| There's some pluses and minuses on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| 03 has a much shorter list of permitted uses and uses permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| and does require some landscaping on any redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| But it also has a smaller rear yard setback and allows bigger wall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| So, you know, there's a bit of a tradeoff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| But I would expect that the recommendation would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| And I didn't hear, I met with the birds today as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| and I didn't hear what the restrictions were with the 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| What were they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| Well, we were looking at 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7055)|
| 1:57:41| And excluding, and I'm now going from memory because I don't have my notes with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| but we were looking at excluding some of the items that were under both permitted uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| and under the uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| And, of course, some there was understanding and acceptance and some there were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| But private clubs and lodges was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| Beauty parlors and barbershops was raised and not resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| Halfway houses, there was agreement about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| Funeral homes, there was agreement about excluding those types of permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| And then on the uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| I think there was some concern about methadone treatment clinics, halfway houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| hospitals which turn out to be inpatient under the definition of the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| as opposed to outpatient clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| We all had a learning experience just going through the definitional section of the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| But those are some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| I think the multifamily dwelling units were in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| Let me say by background, this started as a request by the doctor and his wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| to get additional office uses because they were concerned it's kind of a duplex medical facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7134)|
| 1:59:00| very nice building, very nice operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| They were afraid one of the doctors might decide that solo practitioner in this age of Obamacare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| and overregulation might end up losing a tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| So they wanted a broader set of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| They're living under R2 with a permitted use of a medical facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| And they started out to broaden that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| The opposition by the community representatives at MPC had to do with some of the other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| that we were just trying to describe for you that had potentially more traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| nighttime noise and ambulances and those kinds of things that tended to be disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| This isn't very much an intersection zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| So we were looking at do we try to fashion some conditions to 01| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| or do we pick a zone that's really more neutral about the objectionable portions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| And that's what we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| We spent a lot of time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| So some of those restrictions were tentatively agreed upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| Some of them were and some were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| We just hadn't, you know, we'll be going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| We'd be postponing to have another round of discussions if we could come to agreement on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| until I think 03 reared and looked like it had more of the good things that everyone wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7209)|
| 2:00:17| So that's it for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Let me go to Ms. Palmer and then back to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| In looking at this, I guess this is for Dr. Bird or Ms. Bird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| are there any 03 designations adjacent to, across the street in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7227)|
| 2:00:36| I didn't find any when I looked at the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| I saw 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| Are there any other 03?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| Next to our building is the 01, which is a smaller home that was rezoned in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7241)|
| 2:00:50| And then a couple of places from that is, again, another one that is 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| And then we had real estate executives that received 01 in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| And so, no, it's R2 with our apartments next to us or across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| And then there is a church, and then we also have the 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| One of the things that I want to state, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| is that when we talk about this 03, it does not provide us use on review with R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7271)|
| 2:01:19| When you go even to R2 and you look at one of the factors, for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| it doesn't even allow private daycare, nurseries, or kindergartens and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| And for us, you know, we want to be able to have that flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| just as our other neighbors, business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| And we have all the business owners, we have letters, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| stating that they have no problems with us proceeding with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| Those are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| Let me go to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| I think I'm actually going to oppose the deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| and it's kind of interesting because it doesn't matter on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| or the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| Those will be the same, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. McDonaldson, whether it's 01 or 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| So I would almost say it makes more sense to pass those now, move down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| and talk about the 01, 03 at the proper time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| So I think I'm going to oppose the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| Mr. Greve, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Mr. Delevaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| I was just going to answer Ms. Palmer's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| If you look at the rezoning package in 12F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| there's an 03 diagonally across the street from their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| So, yes, there is 03 in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| There's also 01 and there's R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| So it's a mixed zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| And if you can picture that area of Tazewell Pike, as you leave the traffic light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| there are some businesses, and then you move heavily into residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| and, of course, there's a cemetery on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| Yeah, Vice Mayor, I just want to agree with you because when we send this back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| both sector plans are going to come back the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| So the Byrds are pursuing an 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| and I think they deserve the right to have an up or down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| Ms. Rowdy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| Since we're discussing right now the postponement of these two items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| I would like to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| I will support the postponement because my concern is if, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| there is no rezoning to take place in this property and it remains R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7387)|
| 2:03:12| if we've gone ahead and passed the sector plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| and the one-year plan amendments, then they're out of sync being officed with an R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| So I'm going to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| Mr. Greve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| If we go with the 01 and it's voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| then how long before they can come back again and ask for a rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| Our administrative rules require one year before they can bring back the same zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7415)|
| 2:03:45| Because I think I heard that even though they want an 01, they would take an 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| The neighborhood is saying an 03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| So I just want to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| If we voted 01 down, is there anything within the rules to reconsider an 03?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| What would be the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| If you vote 01 down, well, you could always have a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| If you have the motion to reconsider a subsequent meeting, take six votes to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| The motion has to be made by someone who is on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| I think the point Ms. Roddy made is exactly the reason why I moved to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| In other words, we're changing the sector plan and the one-year plan to facilitate a zone selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7475)|
| 2:04:45| and that will be office of some flavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| Assuming it passes, it could fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| That's what she's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| And then you've got something out of sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| So I thought it just made good sense to have the whole package together when it came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| and we had a recommendation that we could vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| It was just the idea of do we amend it and then have to go back and fix it again or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| It just seemed inefficient to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| I guess I'd just respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| There is sort of a layering of planning that your plans should be broader than your zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7512)|
| 2:05:21| And my sense is an office zone would allow the R2 zone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| It would not be out of sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| If the sector plan was adopted, it would be out of sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| The motion on the floor is to defer 12D and E until such time as MPC comes back with a recommendation on 12F, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7534)|
| 2:05:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7545)|

| 2:05:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| My sense is we should do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7552)|

| 2:05:57| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| The motion passes 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| So these are deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| And we come to 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7575)|
| 2:06:21| 12F is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| northeast of Smithwood Road from R2 District to O1 District CAD Properties Applicant Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| Mr. Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| I would actually like to move that we refer this matter for consideration by MPC to look at the O3 zone and give us their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7593)|
| 2:06:41| And that is a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| Is there any discussion, Mr. Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| Is that a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| I'm sorry, no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| We've already had the discussion, which is we need their opinion on this one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7616)|

| 2:06:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| I hear two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| Are there any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| I heard Mr. Palmer and Mr. Bailey voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| So it is adopted to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| 12G is in ordinance approving the request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission for a one-year plan amendment from heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7631)|

| 2:07:27| And I'll recognize Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| I'd like to make an amendment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| This is a request by the City Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| While it's not a big rush, there is some need for haste on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| I'd like to move to eliminate the 17-day waiting period after the end of adoption on second reading in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7657)|

| 2:07:54| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7676)|
| 2:07:57| No, this is a residence that's been known to industry, and we're trying to get back to where it belongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| All those in favor of the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7682)|

| 2:10:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| Mr. Column, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| I have a quick question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| When this came to us last year, it was in the form of some amendments on the T-C-1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7833)|
| 2:10:40| and I know you and I talked about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| That's still out there someplace, and your sense is there is a need right now for some changes on the T-C-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| and at some point something like that will be coming onto our plate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| But we won't be doing, in this case, for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| We'll be doing it for the right zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| The immediate need for the amendments to the T-C-1 has gone away with this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| We do expect to use T-C-1 again in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| and probably when we get the next application we'll revisit those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| Because they did provide more flexibility as far as development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=7874)|

| 2:13:59| There were some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| We wanted to defer that until Mr. DiLaVope got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| Do folks recall what the questions were at the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| Bring us back up to speed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| Some capital improvements in the park down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| The Forth and Gill Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| What's happening with Forth and Gill Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Vice Mayor Becker, just to clarify, the bids are due tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8056)|
| 2:14:23| On Forth and Gill Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| On the Forth and Gill Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| And I think the question Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| That was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| My understanding on the history of this, Mr. Martin, is that there was some land where there had been some homes previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8072)|
| 2:14:41| and during the process of the I-40 smart fix project, there was concern about a park being dislocated, taken up by the smart fix 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8081)|
| 2:14:56| And the neighborhood came to the city and asked if these residential lots, which had not been redeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| could be made into a pocket park for the benefit of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| As time has progressed, was the park not displaced, Mr. Martin, after all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| Or another park has sort of taken up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| There is another park in the Forth and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| There's another park in the Forth and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| And concurrently with that, the neighborhood saw some great success with some other land that the city was able to offer for infill redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8119)|
| 2:15:28| under the H-1 overlay, and some new homes that are very compatible with Forth and Gill were built, are occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8128)|
| 2:15:36| have added to the fabric of the neighborhood, and the neighborhood's hope now was that these residential lots could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8136)|
| 2:15:43| or this land, instead of being combined and one lotted as a park, could be replatted as residential lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8143)|
| 2:15:49| and be sold to investors who would like to invest in a center city neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| and build and continue to rebuild the fabric of the neighborhood where there are gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| And there is park land available, and this was the desire of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| So my concern was, does this resolution that we pass tonight overarch that initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8163)|
| 2:16:09| which is set to take place tomorrow, and I would hate to short-circuit that inadvertently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| I saw Mr. DellaVolpe and then Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| And that's obviously a good point, and I remember seeing the same information you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| about the neighborhood's desire on the development of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| It strikes me that if we look at Section 1 of the proposed resolution and we look at the fourth line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| we could simply add before that first comma, so it would read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| previously approved capital improvement projects and the pending Forth and Gill Park actions underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8196)|
| 2:16:45| or something that doesn't exclude that from being acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| It just broadened the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| The original language, I think, came because you said there were several parks in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| that actually had capital improvement projects, including a ball field, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| and we might as well just find a way to describe the Forth and Gill effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| and stick it in that other than category so that we don't impact it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| The overall purpose of this resolution, obviously, is to protect parks while MPC studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8229)|
| 2:17:15| which zone is a proper one to fit the active parks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8235)|
| 2:17:20| So I think it's in keeping with the spirit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| And I would move that we add language to Section 1, the fourth line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8244)|
| 2:17:31| that would also include the Forth and Gill Park activities as part of the other than exclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8251)|
| 2:17:38| In other words, the ones that would be allowed to go forward while MPC studies parks generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8258)|
| 2:17:45| So that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| Is that on the motion, Mr. Greve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| Is there any discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| I was going to say that perhaps council can say it better than I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| Oh, Ms. Mitchell says we might not have actually had an original motion to approve the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8279)|
| 2:18:06| So before we go to your motion, we need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| Now, Mr. DeLvape, you need to make that motion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| I'd like to make the motion using the language that council has just penciled in, hopefully correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| reflecting that we're going to leave Forth and Gill activities going forward on the Forth and Gill Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| Is that on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| And I was wondering if Ms. Mitchell could read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| This is on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| Council, read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Let me ask Mr. Swanson to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| The council of the city of Knoxville hereby respectfully requests and strongly urges the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| and all others in the executive branch of the government of the city of Knoxville to refrain from taking any action to implement new uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| in city parks other than previously approved capital improvement projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| and the Forth and Gill Park activities currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| Until such time, the city council has received and had an opportunity to act upon recommendations from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8338)|
| 2:19:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| This is on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| And my question would be for Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Are there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| We've called out capital improvement projects as sort of an umbrella category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| but then in terms of other redevelopment, we've only called out the Forth and Gill project specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| And I don't believe there's any other things underway, but are there any other redevelopment efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| I realize this is very, very unique, that are being contemplated that this might short circuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8370)|
| 2:19:35| No, there are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| As this came up, we've been searching our brains to try to see if there were, and I do not think there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8383)|
| 2:19:44| I was going to say that we almost don't need the resolution, but it was a everyone agrees to play nice in the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8384)|
| 2:19:50| and so I assume that the spirit of the administration will be reflected in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8390)|
| 2:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8397)|
| 2:19:58| All those in favor of the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8398)|

| 2:20:02| That is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| Any comments on the resolution itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| Seeing no lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8409)|
| 2:20:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| We don't have anybody signed up on public forum, so I believe our meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101116?start=8416)|
