| 0:05:51| Mr. Law Director, so I think one question was there needs to be for the past location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| this is going in what used to be the Empire Pizza location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| and the Empire Pizza needs to turn in their, surrender their certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=364)|

| 0:06:08| And the certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| Those need to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Before I look gleefully to Commissioner Schoonmaker for the motion on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| I just want to speak for, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=380)|

| 0:06:32| and then we can have additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| So I'm looking for a motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| We do have codes here, so could they go ahead and give their opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=397)|

| 0:07:46| Our concern in the past has been where people sell, have dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| and then they take a six-pack home with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=471)|

| 0:24:12| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Before we jump right into the agenda, there's a few folks that I'd like to thank and recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| who have taken their time to join us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| First, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| I know you're back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| We also, for so many members of the public, I don't think you always realize, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| if you're watching on TV, Mayor Jacobs has all of his department heads for all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| areas here at the county join us at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| They're populating this whole section area to the chair's left, and that's quite a commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| and we really appreciate your being here tonight and all the nights that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Thank you so much for your dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| I also want to thank Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| I see Tom here in the back, so thank you, Sheriff, for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Ed Schaus, who is our county trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| I know I've got him on the agenda coming up shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Charlie Susano, I see from the clerk's office, and as always, I have to remind the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| about Charlie and I's elementary school days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| Commissioner Daley asked before the meeting if Sister Paulinas from Sacred Heart was still alive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| and I had to say, unfortunately, no, but the last time I spoke with her when my mom died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| Sister Paulinas was 95 years old, and I asked her what she was doing, and she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| I'm so busy taking care of all the old nuns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| So, true story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| And then certainly last but not least, Michael Grider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| You're only raising one hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Can you give me two hands for recognition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Michael Grider is a long-serving public servant who worked for Mayor Burchett for eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1542)|
| 0:25:53| and is now our congressman's chief of staff, and I want to thank you for making the time to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| I hope this isn't your idea of a fun trip back home is coming and watching a county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| but we appreciate you being there, so thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| So, next we are going to move into the part of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| I have two, yeah, oh, and I forgot, Bob Thomas, our school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| I didn't get the super Bob, so thank you, Superintendent Thomas, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| We appreciate you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| I have two folks for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| First, to sign up, I want to, Ed, before you come down, I want to thank Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker is the chairman of our finance committee, and he is, when we had our last finance meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| we had moved it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Ed couldn't be there, so Commissioner Schoonmaker in advance arranged to have Mr. Shouse here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| the trustee, to give an update at public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| So, Ed, if you could please approach the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| You've got about five minutes, and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Thank you, Chairman Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Ed Shouse, 1301 Wilshire Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| Here is a county trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| I appreciate you allowing me to talk today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| I blocked out my July calendar and plans to be here for the finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| knowing that it had been bumped last week and I was out of town, so thank you for having me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1631)|
| 0:27:19| The cash flow is good for the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| We're at about $60 million across the street at VB&T this morning in just our operating funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| We have, and I'll tell you briefly what I'm concerned about the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| we have, if you read about the falling interest rates and President Trump battling with the Fed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| the Fed should do this, the Fed should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Well, the Fed did lower interest rates a few weeks ago, and I'll show you how that comes home to help or hurt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1661)|
| 0:27:49| Let me back up a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| I print this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| This is online, and you guys probably have looked at it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| I printed it and had it put in your box last week because it's the year end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| and it sort of wraps everything up, where we are, how much money we took in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| Everything is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| I mean, I don't see anything that really jumps out as a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| The TIFs and PILOTs, if one year is way ahead of the other or way behind the other, it's an accounting error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| The June money came in in May or the May money didn't come into July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| If you move those around, or I can move them around for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| I hate to say moving the numbers around, but that's just the timing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| The most important thing to me, other than obviously the tax collections, is interest earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| You can see the year of 2016, we earned $1,680,000 in interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| In 2017, we earned $3,059,000, and this past fiscal year, we earned $3,800,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| which, gosh, that's over three cents on a tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| I mean, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| And while I mentioned that earlier about the interest rates falling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I had lunch with some office holders Thursday, and very briefly said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| well, there's $13 trillion in money sloshing around the world economy at negative yields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| The governor corrected me Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| There's $16 trillion with a T at negative yields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| Can you imagine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| You loan a government $10,000, and when your bond matures, you get back $9,860,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| I mean, it's a phenomenon, but it hits us locally here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| We are across the street at BB&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| When this was printed, we were running $235 on that $60 million I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| Now that's down to $220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Not a big deal, but it is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| You strapulate that out over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| It will be a loss of about $140,000 to my office or to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| The markets say that it's going to go down more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| As you know, Trump is in a battle with the Fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| He wants them to go down more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| If they do go down more, this will go down more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| So the 3.8 is what we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| I can't guarantee we can do 3.8 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| I know Finance Director Caldwell factors that in and budgets that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| But $3 million, that's almost free money that we earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| That's the thing that worries me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Everything else is holding up well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| I did print this sheet for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| It's a great sheet for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| It reflects where we're at and what we've collected of every year's taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| We're at, what, 97.3% of the 2018-2019 tax years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| We've still got $7 million outstanding to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| We have a tax sale in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| When is exactly, Justin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| The 17th of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| So this room will be full, we hope, with investors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| whether they be long-term or speculators or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| We don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| We just want them to come in and take the properties that we, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| have had to put into a tax sale because, for one reason or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| people would not or did not have the ability to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| About half of those properties traditionally have gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| have been purchased as a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| The other half wound up at surplus, and the Purchasing Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| Knox County Purchasing, sells those at an online auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| and their goal is to just get them back on the tax roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| which is our goal, to get them back on the tax roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| instead of sitting there earning nothing for us, the taxpayer, who we work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| They will earn something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| That's in 4 minutes and 40 seconds what my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| I'll be happy to answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| If you saw anything in here or in my color sheet or in anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| I'll answer them now, or you can come by my office or call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| I've got two lights on to indicate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| First will be Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Second will be Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| I'll talk while you walk, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| With rates declining, the overnight rate possibly going down on our account with BB&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| we're fixing to issue $37 million worth of bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| plus we have an amount of variable rate bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| which will offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Will this offset enough if rates decline on our debt versus our overnight rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| Overnight rate is $2.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| $2.35 to $2.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| We get $2.20 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| That's at $1.70 that we would lose over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| We'd have to just do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| I think there would be some offset there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| I don't know if it balances completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| And, frankly, the trouble is the variable rate debt is $1.51 as to where his rate affects general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1968)|
| 0:32:58| And so it's kind of two separate pockets of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| So they may offset, but it's in different pots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| So, but potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Mr. Shouse, I'm looking at your colored sheet, the levies and collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| Are the delinquent taxes collected and the outstanding tax levy taxes, are those correlated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2003)|
| 0:33:33| And I'm just looking at those particular line items where you're significantly down on the amount of taxes collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| delinquent taxes collected, and then significantly higher on the outstanding tax levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| Is this a timing thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I mean, it's the very bottom line under 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Both those line items are significantly different than every other year previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| Is it something that you have to close out later, or are we just collecting a lot less delinquent taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| It would be, say, 19, there's only $2,000 in the tax collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| It's just because we're so, we're just barely into that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| And we concentrate on the older money, even though that we're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| But I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| It's fiscal year 19, which would have closed in June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Would have closed, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| So, you're going to have to go through the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| I mean, it's a timing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| You do that tax sale, and then it collects throughout the whole year as you sort of, is there a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| It's a timing issue, and there's no, and the tax sale is a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| I mean, we've been planning on this September tax sale for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| But that might have been stuff from the year before, even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| It's not even fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| We wanted it to be in June, and then we realized it would have to be July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| Then it had to be August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Now it's September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| It's a firm date now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| So, yes, that is a tax, excuse me, that is a timing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| So, if we got this report next year, you would expect those two line items to equalize more as the historical trends were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| Much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| And even much more if we were to have another tax sale in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| We probably won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| There's a world of work involved in those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Thousands of documents have to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Exactly, and that's good of you to notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| I'm just focused on earning that interest, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| What he mentioned, Chris, the other side of the equation, the county should save on debt issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Good question, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Next on public forum, I have Corinne Rovetti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Please, I hope I pronounced your name correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| If you could please approach forward and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| My name is Corinne Rovetti, 6925 Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| I'm here as a representative of the Keep the Urban Wilderness Peaceful Group and the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| I'm going to shift orientation quite a bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| So, I'm coming as a community resident before the commission today to seek clarity of the role that the county commission plays in the process for oversight of county code violations and irregularities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2150)|
| 0:36:04| I'm going to talk specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| I'm going to talk in regard to the South Knoxville proposed Ancient Lore Village commercial project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| which is seeking zoning change from agricultural to planned commercial and south sector plan amendment from low-density residential to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2170)|
| 0:36:21| This has been postponed for review before the planning commission since February and tabled indefinitely since April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2181)|
| 0:36:29| And yet, through a series of loopholes, construction seems to be in full force underway for a project that has not been heard or reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2189)|
| 0:36:39| and, in fact, on the record has been told by the planning commission that it could not be supported for approval as presented for these zoning changes and sector amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2199)|
| 0:36:52| I'm going to give some examples of the loopholes that I'm speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| So, building permits were granted for a single family residential dwelling while simultaneously the project released a media blitz announcing breaking ground for its commercial prototypes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2216)|
| 0:37:10| The county permit offices tells us that under consult with their legal department that they cannot deny a permit based on intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2230)|
| 0:37:21| So, what that says to me that one can falsely represent an application for a residential dwelling permit while clearly obtaining the permit to build a commercial prototype,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2241)|
| 0:37:33| which is what's been undergoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| That seems like a pretty big loophole to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| There have been a couple of TDEC violations in regard to the aquatic resource alteration permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2258)|
| 0:37:47| TDEC has denied approval of the ALV's general construction plan based on these stormwater discharge violations until just last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2267)|
| 0:37:59| despite the fact that construction has been done seemingly and according to those plans as if it were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2279)|
| 0:38:08| But because they haven't been approved, one can do what they want to their private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| And so, there has been construction underway that basically would be in compliance with a plan that has not been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| That seems like a fairly major loophole to me that all this construction can happen right now under the permission of individual property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2304)|
| 0:38:34| though those plans are really based on a construction plan hoping to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2314)|
| 0:38:43| We're hoping now that approval has happened that maybe there'll be better monitoring of the construction that's undergoing and that that possibly will stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| But it seems a little strange that the state now approves a general construction plan for a project that the county says will not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2330)|
| 0:39:00| How does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| I'm trying to understand and then understand how county commission oversights that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| A couple of other little things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Despite the evidence of excavation of 3.6 acres of land with slopes greater than 50% on Brown Mountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| which is protected under the hillside and ridgetop protection plan, those occurrences have been happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| So, again, we don't have oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| There seems to be violations, even though we know that the ridgetop and hillside protection plans are recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| But they're strong recommendations, especially for the south sector plan on the Brown Mountain area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| There seems to be some evidence of some subservice excavation, which would normally require permits, and that hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2381)|
| 0:39:50| It's been neighbors that have been intimidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| We have one neighbor who has repeatedly been threatened with gun violence by workers on John Norton Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| That seems of serious concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| We've reported that to the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| They have refused to give us a report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| We've had trespassing on private property that has continued despite warnings and proper signage that has been posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2411)|
| 0:40:22| That seems to be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Fairly recently, we've had two former county commissioners who do a weekly podcast, of which on the August 7th podcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2424)|
| 0:40:36| which I forwarded to everybody sitting here, including the mayor's office and the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| the Ed and Bob show were advocating that this specific project should probably move ahead without permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2441)|
| 0:40:52| and ask for forgiveness afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| The mayor's office actually responded to my forwarding this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Ma'am, I'm going to give you just a little bit more time to kind of wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Okay, just about ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| If you could just start to wrap it up, please, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| I'm getting ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| So the mayor's office told us to be assured that permission would first occur before forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| I haven't heard from anybody on this panel in regards to our concerns with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| ALV has been tabled while plunging ahead with construction, aggressive PR campaign, pushing this project as if it's been approved already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2481)|
| 0:41:30| What I need to know is what does our community do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Our legal consultation states that because of these loopholes, there is no accountable or actionable process at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2493)|
| 0:41:42| So what does the county commission do to oversight these ordinance and regulation irregularities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| Ma'am, I'm going to need you to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| We gave everybody in fairness five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| This is my last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| So I want to thank Carson Daly, our county commissioner, for his attention to our concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| and I would really like for the county commission to address these loopholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| Thanks for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| I appreciate hearing a response at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Okay, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Is there anyone else here who wants to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| I believe we only had two who signed up in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| You know, I don't have my glasses on, so I can't quite see that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| It's Matthew Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Mr. Cross, if you could step forward and state your name and address for the record, and you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Although she spoke a little over, so you'd have five minutes and about 40 seconds, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I'm Matthew Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| I'm 1710 Bonnie Roach Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| I'm the chief executive officer of Ancient Lore Village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| and I appreciate the concerns brought up by a concerned citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| I would speak to intent because I think that that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| That's the only thing I'd provide unless prompted, additional questions by commission or the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| because she brings up excellent points, points that we ourselves have been confounded by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| which is what is the correct process moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| The county defines a project being commercial, obviously, by zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| We are not a commercial project until we receive such zoning by the county, which, again, Corinne is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| We are in the process of obtaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| The state does not feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| So our original TDEC violation stemmed from the fact that a project is deemed commercial by intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| something that I was not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| I am not a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| This is a new hat for me to wear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| So we are viewed by the state as a commercial project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| So we have applied and been in process with the state to obtain a commercial grading permit, CGP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| which is governed by a SWEP permit, which is Stormwater Prevention Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| All of this is done as if we are a commercial project because that's the state's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| The county doesn't operate that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| We are the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| We are a residential project of Tom Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| And the model home that we are building is being built purely to vet construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| Now, our intentions are to be a commercial enterprise, but we don't know where that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| Obviously, we want it to be in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| We're operating with the intention of it being in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| But we do know we will build a village somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| So our marketing, our branding, all of that is being done to communicate to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| One day we'll have a village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| We obviously hope that it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| So I think intent is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Concerned Citizen and I have spoken about this before, about intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| And I wanted to go on record and explain the perspective of Ancient Laura Village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| and what we're doing and how we are trying to navigate these differing processes going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| So if there are any questions, obviously I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| And I'd yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Well, Mr. Cross, what I might also suggest, if any of the commissioners do have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| you can make sure that Drusilla in the commission office has got your contact information as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| in case they have a random phone call or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Any other questions for Mr. Cross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Thank you, Mr. Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| This concludes the public forum for tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| We are now at the point in the meeting where we will review and actually set tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| However, before I jump into that briefly, I know that Commissioner Busler wanted to make a brief announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| I'm going to make this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Something's happening in Knoxville next year that's going to be really big to bring focus on Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| In June of next year, the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, we will have the state junior amateur tournament here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2753)|
| 0:46:03| That's 150 players from all over the state coming in here from Memphis, Tullahoma, all across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| They will be bringing parents, grandparents, other siblings with them to bring a big kind of hit for us here in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2770)|
| 0:46:19| That's done out at Three Ridges Golf Course, which the county owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| and I think that's going to be really great for this area to bring this kind of point of emphasis of what we can do here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2783)|
| 0:46:33| Thank you for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Tonight, as I look through our agenda, let me review coming out of last week's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| We have got four items that I'm going to review it, and then we can verify if you want to add, we can do it in one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| But to formally add to the agenda was items 9, 50, 51, and 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2809)|
| 0:47:01| Item 52 will be deferred to October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| The items tonight that were not placed on the consent agenda are items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 28, 29, 38, 40, 41, 49, 50, 51, and 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2828)|
| 0:47:37| Also, as it relates to item 59, we will need to schedule a public hearing when we get to that in the zoning part of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| Are there any other additions or subtractions, or is there anything that's currently on consent that any of the commissioners would like to pull at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2865)|
| 0:47:55| The chair will entertain a motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2875)|

| 0:48:00| Motion from Commissioner Andersen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| I thought I heard a murmur from over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| From Commissioner Jay is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| So is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2886)|

| 0:48:17| And Madam Clerk, what is the first item on tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| It's Resolution 101 honoring Trees Knoxville for its award from the Southern Group of State Foresters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| I'm excited to have been able to bring this resolution for us, and it is a big deal that we're recognizing Trees Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| I also want to be clear because this isn't as clear in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| This group, over the last few years, has helped complete tree plantings and plant trees at many of our public schools here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2918)|
| 0:48:47| Westmoreland Middle, New Hopewell Elementary, Fulton High School, Sequoia Elementary, Mount Olive Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2927)|

| 0:49:01| They've been a great partner for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| And speaking also, wearing my hat as a member of the Ag Committee for Knox County, I'm really pleased to be able to thank them for their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2943)|

| 0:49:32| I'll go ahead and the chair is needing a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2972)|
| 0:49:47| Do I have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Motion for approval from, I'll say, Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2997)|

| 0:49:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Let's get this into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Whereas, Trees Knoxville is a network of various community organizations and leaders that share a common vision of growing our urban forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| And whereas, Trees Knoxville recently received the Urban and Community Forestry Partnership Award from the Southern Group of State Foresters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3012)|

| 0:50:48| to preserve, increase, and increase the urban tree canopy in the private and public lands of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3048)|

| 0:52:32| If you'd like to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| I'd like to thank the Commission for the recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3154)|

| 0:52:40| I also want to point out, I don't see Russ. He was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| Russ Oaks has really worked closely with us to place these trees and go through a process to locate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| where it doesn't impact security or safety and also it benefits the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| If you ever go out to a school, if you ever notice when there's trees on campus, where do the kids congregate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| It's under that tree because it's cooler there and they can play under the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| But we certainly appreciate Knox County for allowing us to plant these trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| and also the Stormwater Parks and Rec for allowing us to place trees on other Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| Again, I want to thank you, and we hope in the future we can work with some of y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| You're always welcome to come out and help plant trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Last, I would say, trees are good. They do a lot for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| Oh, I meant to say, we actually had an arborist meeting here last week or a week before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| and we had over 1,100 people here, tree lovers, people that work in trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| and they really complimented Knoxville and Knox County for their trees and their canopies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| and really appreciated the things that Knoxville and Knox County did for them while they were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=3227)|

| 1:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4122)|

| 1:08:48| but I'd like you to take just a couple of minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| to talk a little bit about your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| and exactly the role and responsibility of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| I'm Brian Rivera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| I'm the interim director for air quality management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| and my address is 140 Damard Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| The Knox County Air Pollution Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| is an entity that was established in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| and the powers of the board are basically two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| The first is whenever we develop regulations for our industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| and when we accept EPA rules, we have to present it to our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| and they are the entity that approves the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| and regulations for us to enforce in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| So that's their primary objective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| and we typically will present that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| The second is they are an appeal board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| So if somebody disputes one of our enforcement actions we're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| or a permit indecision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| they can appeal the department's decision to the air board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| who will hear it and then make a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| either to agree with us or to amend our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| So those are the two fundamental tasks of the air board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| We've had three folks who have applied for this particular position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| and, of course, the commission is welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| if they'd like to nominate somebody from the floor to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| You can go and have a seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| but stay close in case there's questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| We have Corey Johnson, Lynn Littington, and Chris Sharp have all applied for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| What I'd like to do tonight is I'm going to give each applicant five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| to make a statement about why he or she would be the best person for this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| I'll ask them to actually approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| I'll call your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Afterwards, when we go to the voting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| I'll reference the Knox County Commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| on page five of our commission rulebook in terms of how we'll be conducting the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| and I will reference those rules specifically as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| and exactly how the vote process will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| But first I'd like to ask Corey Johnson to approach the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| Is Corey here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4272)|
| 1:11:24| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| I'll go ahead and just state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| and then you've got five minutes to share with us some insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| I'm Corey Johnson, and it's 206 Gayview Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| Plain and simple, I'm here to join the commission to help Knox County as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| I believe, in making new rules and regulations, and I like presenting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| That's pretty much what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| A good chunk of any job in most of my life is making things a little bit better for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4313)|
| 1:12:03| Pretty simple, plain and straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| If anybody has any questions, I'm happy to answer anything for what I've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| or what I might need to do or if you guys think I can do anything to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| I'd say go ahead and have a seat fairly close up in case we have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| And Ms. Lynn Lidington, if you could please approach the podium, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| Commissioners, my name is Lynn Lidington, 5717 Roberts Road in Coryton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| I have spent almost my entire career working for the Department of Air Quality Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4359)|
| 1:12:48| I feel that in a time when we have reached attainment of our air quality standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| it is vital that we continue on that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| We have threats to that attainment status, things that we can control and cannot control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4379)|
| 1:13:08| weather being one of them, weather has a tremendous impact on our air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| Just because we are now in attainment does not mean that we will stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4395)|
| 1:13:22| We have to be very diligent in what we do, in what the board does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| to make sure that we don't take steps back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| The regulations that we have put forth and have been enforcing are what got us into attainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| and we've got to be very careful that we don't try to go back and reverse some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| While at the same time, we've got to balance what we're doing with the department and the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4424)|
| 1:13:52| to protect our community development, which is something that's also very key to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you, Ms. Lidington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| If you could have a seat, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| And Mr. Sharp, if you could please approach the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| I'm Chris Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| I live at 12024 Willingham Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| I'll tell you what, if you could raise the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| You've got a problem with being tall, so if you could raise it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| That's a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| So, yeah, so for me, it's really just contributing back to my community based on my experience in air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| I started out here working for Knox County Air Quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| I worked there for about eight or nine years and went into consulting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| did consulting for air quality for various governments and industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| and then have worked in the private sector as well for manufacturing sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| And even though most of my experience is all environmental, it's heavily focused on air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| So you understand what happens, you know, when there's attainment issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| and how that affects industry as well as attainment issues affecting the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| So just based on that experience, I feel like I'm ready to contribute back to my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| and be a part of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Yes, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Mr. Sharp, I notice you currently work for Johns Manville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Do you all have any business here in Knoxville that would be applying for quality grants or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| So we have a large facility down at Etowah, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| That's kind of my home base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| I was just making sure there wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| For my plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| I've got 10 plants across the U.S., but that's the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Go ahead and have a seat, Mr. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| What I'm going to do, especially for the benefit, we've got Commissioner Beeler here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| and it's always a good idea to kind of review our rules briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| At this point, if you all recall, when we do a vote like this, nominees will come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| We'll have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| We've got three that have expressed an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| When we have a vote, the person who gets the least amount of votes, if you have all three before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| the person who receives the least votes will drop, and then it will go to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| Unless you get six on the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| So, briefly, this is directly from our county commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| Nominators may speak directly about their nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| Nominees may speak about themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Hearing you guys talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| After each commissioner has afforded ample opportunity to express his or her views and responding views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| the chair will ask if all commissioners are ready for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| If any commissioner wants further discussion, further discussion will be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| When discussion is complete, voting will commence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| By roll call vote, each commissioner may vote in favor of one nominee by name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| and the nominee with the least number of votes is disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| After each vote, the chair will invite further discussion by commissioners regarding the remaining nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| If there is a tie vote, the chair will invite the nominators and remaining nominees to speak again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| and the chair will invite further discussion by commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| Voting will resume until a nominee receives the votes of a majority of the members of the commission eligible to vote on the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| That's the basics of our process straight from the rule book of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| So, what the chair will entertain, if we could get motions for the nominees to be placed on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| This will be roll call for nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Where was the last roll call vote we did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| You all know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| We can go ahead and start in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Is this for nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| I'd like to nominate Lynn Liddington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Commissioner Carringer nominates Ms. Liddington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| Commissioner Smith nominates Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| I'll nominate Mr. Sharpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Commissioner Nystrom nominates Mr. Sharpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| I'm going to make a motion that the nomination cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| We have a motion that nomination cease by Commissioner Anders, second by Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=4690)|

| 1:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| West Rock Converting LLC still has their glass contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| Is there any way that we might be able to obtain another year on our glass contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| and kind of feel like the wool has been pulled over our eyes rather quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| Is there any way we could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| Well, I would say we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| We had a meeting, procurement, solid waste officials, our buyer, with West Rock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| and we actually asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| So their response was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| And we even offered to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| We didn't talk numbers, but their response was not at any price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| So it has been something we explored because, again, it was an abrupt change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| It was not something we wanted to stop collecting glass within a month's period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| We normally roll out changes at the convenience centers over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| But the answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| My next question is whenever we take these glass, is this just going to go to a landfill now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| That's just where it's going to head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| So today actually is the first day that these containers have been removed from convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| And, you know, we try to put a lot of thought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| So if you just need to get rid of your glass at a convenience center, you haven't lost service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| You can throw that in the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| When the container was pulled away, we put a sign that says no glass recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| Now you can place it in the trash, but you can also see operator for details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| And our operators have a pamphlet or, sorry, a flyer that they are giving anyone who seems concerned about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5128)|
| 1:25:35| because there are people who recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| The last thing they want to do is throw it in the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| It lists the current options for them for recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| They'll have to drive away and take it to that other location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| But we felt it important to honor, you know, folks' concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| And they've taken that time to separate that glass from their waste stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| And we wanted to make sure they had an option of where they could take it if they want to continue to recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| Could you just refresh my memory on how much the contract was last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| So for the past five years, they've been taking glass for that fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| Like the contract for the company that we had last year, how much it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| Well, so it was no fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| For the past five years, they haven't paid us for it, but they've accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| So if you do the math at how many tons we deliver, it's a cost avoidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| It's about $12,500 that we did not have to spend in burying it in a hole forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| because, you know, everything that comes into a convenience center has to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| So I can drive it out and get paid for it if it's paper, cardboard, aluminum, scrap metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5203)|
| 1:26:50| Or I could drive it out and bury it in a hole forever into a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| In this situation, glass was a no charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| And it's been that way for about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| So we're losing that cost avoidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| The way that the contract has worked and will continue to work is anything that can be pegged to any kind of an index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| so paper markets or steel, those prices fluctuate, and it's a very similar arrangement we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5232)|
| 1:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| So I got your question covered, Mr. Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| All right, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Drew, thank you for the conversation we had over the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| We kind of went through some scenarios and some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| And we kind of even, I don't know how far that you got with those conversations with anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| but we're looking for alternative uses for that glass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| and seeing if we could, as a county and maybe regionally, take that glass in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| and have it sorted with community corrections folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| I don't think the sheriff is comfortable with allowing people from inside the jail to come and work with glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| and I completely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| But there are some people that are doing community service work for DUIs or for other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| that maybe they could sort that glass, we could crush it and sell it off to somebody that could have a use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| So the conversation is still going on, and, Drew, I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| That's really all I wanted to say about the conversation we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| All right, thank you, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| Hey, Drew, how are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Hey, Drew, this seems to be a reoccurring event that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| I know like a year or two ago we had problems getting a contract with our brush pickup and recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5304)|
| 1:28:36| In an area as, you know, Knox County, this metropolitan area is fairly large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| Why are we having so much trouble getting recycling companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| What can we do to draw them here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Apparently we need them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| We need more competition, it seems like, because most of these are just one person's bid and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| I wish I knew the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| If I knew the answer to that, I might resign my post and start a company and go into business and turn a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5337)|
| 1:29:04| I will say you're right, green waste is a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5344)|
| 1:29:12| This one, this material recovery facility service, there was no other bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| There are probably a few services like that that the county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| I don't know all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| I attend these meetings where we're kind of stuck with whoever bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| It's not like if it's a mower or plumbing contract, there's 20 other plumbers or mowers that want to step up and fill that void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5370)|
| 1:29:40| I've spoken with the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| I'm on a few of their committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| I occasionally go to meetings in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| One of the things I've told them is that they focus so much on us collecting recyclables at the municipal level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| but they never focus on the jobs or the industry that's needed to support once you collect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| It's like once we have this stuff collected at convenience centers, I need to drive it to someone like this material recovery facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| They need places, paper mills and rebar, manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5407)|
| 1:30:15| I would just say is I think the state of Tennessee needs to do a little bit better at recruiting recycling industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5415)|
| 1:30:25| and less focus on forcing us to collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| It's like they force us to collect these things, but they don't think about where it's going to go after we've collected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| That's the problem with glass is there's not companies out there that just want glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| There are companies out there that want metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| Scrap metal, I don't have that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| Green waste is weird where they bought out the competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| so I can't speak too much about that other than they acquired their competitor so that they became one company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5448)|
| 1:31:01| Paper and cardboard, we have several factories in the area that probably are within logistical range to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5461)|
| 1:31:09| I guess that's where ultimately a lot of our paper winds up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| We also have Alcoa and Alcoa for aluminum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| We have several steel plants around here, but we don't seem to have anybody for glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| Logistically, where is the closest place glass can be taken for processing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| My understanding is that the glass is somewhere in Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| I don't know how big of a document you have with this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| but one of the things we ask them is where are they taking this stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| It's not just I collect it at convenience centers and then we deliver it to the material recovery facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| We want to know that they're not just dumping it somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| so we want to make sure they have markets after they collect it from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| They list it off that they have various mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| Alcoa, that's where all of the aluminum goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| Garedale, Ameristill is where the steel cans go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| Mohawk, which if you've ever bought carpet, that's where most of the plastics we sell them are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| We are convenience centers and recyclers who sort their recycling from their trash are supporting regional industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5532)|
| 1:32:21| It's not just a touchy-feely thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| We get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| We depend on that revenue to offset the operational costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| These are a real thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| I'm glad you asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| I'm sorry, I don't know if I answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| We looked into the process of a glass grinder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| That way we could turn this to sand and maybe use it on roads in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| I've visited places where you can take glass and put it in a thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| and on the other side it ends up in the equivalent of sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| You could rub it in your hands together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| We have not entertained the notion for us to operate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| We're really a kind of middleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| We collect it from residents at centers, and then we have a truck back up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| We never touch it, and then drive it to another place where we can dump it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| For us to go in the business of putting things, I would say processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| that's where we have this material recovery facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| We're large enough to where it's too much for us to handle internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=5608)|

| 1:41:53| There's a procedure whereby the chiefs, by statute, will send names to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| And that's where that decision would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| You all are just saying that whoever qualifies that you will waive your portion in the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| And the qualification is if you've been a firefighter, volunteer firefighter, for one year and you're active in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6128)|
| 1:42:15| and the chief actually sends the names to the clerks and they qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| So once you approve it, it falls into the administration and certification of the clerk and the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| And the chief will send a list in every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| And what's the number on that list as of current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| Chief John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| Chief, it sounds like you may want to approach the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6156)|
| 1:42:43| Just kindly state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| My name is John Linson Bigler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| I live in Sevier County at 1332 Trenum Circle, but my wife would say I live at the Knox County Fire Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6169)|
| 1:42:57| Currently, Carson had brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| There's currently 21 of our volunteers that live inside Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| but only 13 of those would qualify to meet what the TSA code requires on that at this current time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| The other two counties, we submit a list to all the county clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| They go through the EMA office in Blount and Sevier County, the same thing, and update this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| I think that's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Is there any other questions for Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| Mr. Biggs, I saw your light flash for a second there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| If I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| I spoke with John Whitehead's squad and said that this is going to be going on and happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| and they're wanting to be a part of it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| but at that time I really didn't feasibly get all that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| I thought I was clear last week that I wanted them included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| I support the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| I just think it's silly to do two ordinances for the same issue, but I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| I thought I made myself pretty clear last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| Is that your light bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| No, I was just going to say, bottom line, if we went that route, we would be back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| This way we'll get the fire volunteers in right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| Well, kind of what I'm hearing is if we do this, we get this part completely done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| and then we can move on to the second resolution next month that will take care of the rescue folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| That's kind of what I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| You can only do this one by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| The rescue squad will be three months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| This one will be two months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| This one's done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| This one's done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| First reading, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| Next month we'll have the second vote on this, and we can bring the first reading for rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| That's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Exactly what you said, Mr. Chairman, and what Randy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Let's go ahead and do the firefighters tonight because some of their tags may be expiring late September, October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| Then we'll do a full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| Mr. Armstrong and Jill, let's do a full commission next month for rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| The motion is probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| We will now need to do a roll call vote, which will be led by the helper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Go ahead, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6316)|

| 1:45:55| Thank you for bringing that to us, Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| It's a motion and vote of the Commission to mandate that the Chair call a special session of the Commission on September 3, 2019 at 4 p.m. in the Main Assembly Room of the City-County Building for the purpose of reorganizing the Commission, making appointments to various Boards and Committees, and electing officers to the Commission's Standing Committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6362)|
| 1:46:23| Thank you. I'm going to make a couple of comments and then I'll call on Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| This is something that came to us from the Rules Committee this past year that mandated that we do the reorg meeting on September 1 or the first business day coming back from thereafter, considering the Labor Day holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6389)|
| 1:46:44| There was some discussion at the work session if we, because there were a few Commissioners that might not be able to be at this, if it's the will of this body to change that day, then the steps that need to take place, we would have to vote to suspend the rules, and then to vote to suspend the rules would actually require eight in the affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6404)|
| 1:47:08| Mr. Law Director, we have one Commissioner missing tonight. Would that be two-thirds of the whole body, or is that two-thirds of who we have here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6428)|
| 1:47:18| Two-thirds of the membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Okay, so that would be eight to confirm. Okay. So if it is the will of this body to do that, it would require eight affirmative votes to suspend the rules for this one item. We could then vote on it, and then if we choose to change the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6440)|
| 1:47:37| If that motion comes before, and if it does not pass, then the reorg vote will be on, we would have to have the reorg vote on September 3 at 4 p.m., although we could debate to a certain extent on what time of day it would be at. Is that clear enough for everyone? Okay. Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6457)|
| 1:47:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will be supporting suspending the rules. I think it is very important that as many of us are here as possible on the day that we reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6477)|
| 1:48:07| All right. Thank you. Is there any other discussion? All right. The Chair will now open up a, on that note, Commissioner Smith, I am going to look to you, and would you consider that a motion to suspend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6487)|
| 1:48:22| I make a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Okay. We have a motion to suspend the rules by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| This, now, discussion? Is there any discussion on this item? Okay. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6510)|
| 1:48:39| Well, and just for clarification, and I will defer to Drew, but I believe we set this date in July of 2018, so 13 months ago we could have put it on our calendar that we are having a meeting on that September 3. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6519)|
| 1:48:57| It was set by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| Okay. Thank you. Does this require a roll call vote, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Okay. I believe so. Okay. Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| And let me just add, circumstances happen, and that not being a full week for Knox County and being the end of summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6548)|
| 1:49:18| and we have Commissioner Gill who is away at a family funeral, and also her mom lives there in Mississippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6558)|
| 1:49:28| and she has an uncle that has been placed on hospice that they are not expecting to any day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6568)|
| 1:49:36| and she had planned to go and spend the whole week through Labor Day with her family, which is very, very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6576)|
| 1:49:44| and out of respect for Mrs. Gill, but also I had heard that Commissioner Bussler was going to be gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6584)|
| 1:49:53| and now he says he may be driving back in from South Carolina and going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| Anyway, there's circumstances that could change and might hamper him being back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6598)|
| 1:50:06| As far as me, there may be a hurricane and I may not get to go, but they will refund our money, but that's my, you know, that's my feel on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6606)|
| 1:50:15| I don't understand what the big, I guess, sort of disrespect there is or to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6615)|
| 1:50:25| I have accommodated myself many a times for people on commission whose work schedules don't accommodate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| but I have never complained about it, but, you know, vote with whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6633)|
| 1:50:40| If it's that big a deal, it's really that we reorganize by the end of September or in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6640)|
| 1:50:47| but certainly feel free to do what you think is in respect to all your colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6647)|
| 1:50:55| Whether or not I was going to be here or not, I may be, but it's respect for your colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| and particularly respect for somebody who has some family sadness right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| and so let your conscience be your vote, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner. Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| Okay. Now, to restate exactly what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| We are voting on to suspend the rules as it applies to this specific item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| We are not voting on a date. We're not voting on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| And the outcome of that vote will determine the next action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| Is that perfectly clear for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| Okay. Madam Clerk, I believe this is a roll call item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Chairman, I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Yes, Commissioner Bix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| What's the rules? The rules state that it's supposed to be the first day after the first of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| Can you give me the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| First business day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| First business day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Okay. So is the business day that Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| No, that's a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Labor Day is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| September 1st is Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| So we automatically roll to the 3rd, which is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Okay. How long does reorganization take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| An hour, hour and a half at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| All right. And what's the rules state about Skyping in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| A little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| May I look to the law department for that clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Yeah, I mean, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| No electronic communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Yeah, no electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| No electronic communication. Over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| If we were having a work session and someone wanted to listen in and participate that way with no vote, but for the vote to count, it's got to be in present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| All right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Yep. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Just a little background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| I remember whenever I was elected chair, it was the day of the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| Went from organization straight over here straight to running a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| And this came about because we wanted to try to avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| We also wanted to try to avoid if there was something bad happened in the county and we had to call a meeting, we weren't organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| I think the rule's a little concrete here when it needs a little bit of flexibility to where we can try to accommodate everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| You know, maybe we shouldn't have pinned it down into the first business day in September when I think our charter really says we have until the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6782)|
| 1:53:13| Before your next called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| Before your next called meeting, which is all the way up to the third week of the third Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| Again, I think as a body that works together, we should do everything we can to make sure everybody is here when we reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6802)|
| 1:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| One of the things that you kind of touched on and actually occurred during that time lapse to where we did meet on that work session day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6817)|
| 1:53:47| we were trying to get an emergency resolution passed and we were informed by the law department because we hadn't formally organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6827)|
| 1:53:55| we couldn't do an emergency resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| So that all fell by the wayside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| But if we'd have followed the procedure of that first business day, we would have been able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| So that's why we backed it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| And then, of course, the feeling was if you have a new chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| you don't want to just throw them into the work session and not having an opportunity to prepare and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| Ben Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| I just want to address some of Commissioner Carringer's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| I think this is not necessarily about respect or not respecting of anybody's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| I think it's about the precedence that we're about to go down potentially of basically personal conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6873)|
| 1:54:41| which could be personal, it could be family, it could be vacation, it could be school, it could be illness, it could be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| That if you begin the suspension of rules to change the calendar on something that's set in the rules as a structured thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6887)|
| 1:54:58| then what prevents us from saying Commissioner Daley is in knee surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| and we would like to suspend the rules to not have this meeting here or there or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| And, you know, we all have sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| We have work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| We have family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| We have spring breaks were gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| We have work conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| And several of us, you know, have spent tremendous time and effort to return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| and financial means to return, you know, from work trips or other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| I just think it's more about a precedence of do you want to go down the path of changing the rules according to everybody's schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6922)|
| 1:55:30| And we are all going to certainly have respect and consideration, especially for illness, for family members, for deaths in the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6930)|
| 1:55:37| I think that's without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| It's more to go down this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| That means next month somebody else is going to have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| And next month somebody else is going to have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| And where do you end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Where do you continue to jockey the schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| So I just wanted to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| Much of what Commissioner Jay said was what I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| and that is that the camaraderie on this body is very evident from the retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| from just other things and the way we interact with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| I don't think this is personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| I don't think this is an issue of respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| I think that this is an issue that affects more people than just the members of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| When and where we meet and so forth affects the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| It affects the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| It affects the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| It affects department heads and a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| And reorganization, this is going to be, what, the third reorganization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| We've never had a problem getting it scheduled, getting it reorganized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| There seems to be this real, real hurry, rush, rush, we've got to have it this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| If, for instance, Ms. Gill isn't back and Mr. Busler can't make it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7018)|
| 1:57:06| and suppose I'm not or something else, you don't even have a tiebreaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| But all besides that, we have amended rules on many, many times about situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7032)|
| 1:57:22| Something as important as reorganization, that's important to every commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7042)|
| 1:57:30| and with their committees and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| So there seems to be this hurry, hurry, we've got to do it this certain day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7054)|
| 1:57:42| which tends to be a little disturbing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7062)|
| 1:57:51| And let me just tell you, if Commissioner Daley was having surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| I would be more than glad to reschedule a day for Mr. Daley to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| But for whatever, I mean, as the body is the hoe, I just, I think something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7078)|
| 1:58:08| this is probably one of the most important things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| So it seems to be kind of disturbing to see that we can't come together with a good date to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7092)|
| 1:58:25| when you've got the, you know, a good two or three weeks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| When they schedule that date, I always schedule dates in my phone that comes and clicks along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| And when I was making my vacation schedule, it clicked up that we had reorganization on the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7120)|
| 1:58:47| When we were getting ready to go, we're going to go anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| We may leave tonight or tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| But we'll be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| But I've got it in the plans to be back here at 4 o'clock when it was originally scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7135)|
| 1:59:04| So I made plans back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| Whether you all change it or not, that's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| But I will be here the date that you set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| And I had made specific plans to be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| So this thing where he may or may not be back, unless I get killed on the road, come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| I will be back here for that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| Let's hope that does not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| But if that's the schedule, I looked on my schedule for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| and I'm scheduled for the first day after again and the next year after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7174)|
| 1:59:42| because this phone does that crazy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| So you know when it's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| So anyway, don't do it because you think, I'm not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| Thank you, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| I just had one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| This is obviously separate of what is immediately before us, which is the suspension of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| But has anybody actually proposed a date that would work for Commissioner Gill, for Commissioner Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7205)|
| 2:00:11| the clerk's office, the law department, and the other 17 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| Or is that all a conversation that's after the first conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| I mean, has anybody even proposed anything separately of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| Or is that conversation not even going to begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| That has not been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| However, I had Drusilla, in anticipation of this potential vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| send out a copy of the calendar for this room to know exactly what was available in the month of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7229)|
| 2:00:38| Well, that's just a calendar of the room, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| That's not an understanding of the other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| It's somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| This motion to review, is there any other discussion or questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| The motion that was brought to us by Commissioner Smith is to suspend the rules as it applies to this particular item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7253)|
| 2:01:01| It would require eight positive votes to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| So, Madam Clerk, I would like you to lead a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7272)|

| 2:01:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| Commissioner Jay votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7282)|

| 2:01:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| Commissioner Nystrom votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| And Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| No, no matter what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| I'll vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| Commissioner Busler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| Do any commissioners wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7306)|
| 2:02:05| Okay, the motion does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| The total is 6-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| The ayes have six, the noes have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| This required a vote of two-thirds majority, which would have been eight votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7334)|
| 2:02:21| So, with that said, still operating, that was a specific to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7341)|
| 2:02:29| We still have the motion before us, which is item number 50, which is a motion and vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| of the commission to mandate that we call a specially called session of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| on September 3rd at 4 p.m. in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| That is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| It can be modified as to time, but the date has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| Is there anyone who would like to make a motion and or second on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| Motion to approve item 50, 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| We have a motion from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| The second was from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| So, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| A vote no here would do what if it did not get six votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| It doesn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| Yeah, it really doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| The chairman said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| The motion is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| Yeah, the motion is irrelevant, but I guess we would like to have the vote since we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| it before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| So, all in favor of this one, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| The chair recognizes Commissioner Carringer for a nay vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Discussion item regarding the new Knox County logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| Do we have a representative from the mayor's office so I can ask a couple of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| We've got a bunch of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7438)|
| 2:04:10| Now, while you're coming up here, I just want to make a note that I am not against the new logo or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7450)|
| 2:04:18| I'm just asking some questions of how we got to where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| I just want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| Rob, could you please state your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| Rob Link, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| When we talked to the public about this new logo, and we were explained in our little retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7475)|
| 2:04:42| but I think the public, it's new to the public for some people asking what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| Why is the logo like it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| I mean, how did you get to that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| The mayor commissioned a new logo just as a fresh look that represents all that Knox County stands for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7492)|
| 2:05:01| its beauty, its importance in transportation with 75 and 40 running through the county together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7501)|
| 2:05:10| It will be used to bring a more consistent look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| If you look at the departments under his purview, there are several different logos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| We use the seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| We use the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| This will be used across the board as just a single logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| I know when we changed the logo for Legacy Parks, we had about four or five different things come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7531)|
| 2:05:39| and we were trying to get certain things in there to say this represents this, this represents that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| and this is what the logo stands for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| So when it goes out, we can explain underneath it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| The seal has its name and what it is, the official seal and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| But I wonder, you know, it just looks like a picture there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| I know in some of the Legacy Parks deal, it has the explanation a little bit about the unit itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7562)|
| 2:06:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| We're working on a branding guide, a pretty comprehensive branding guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| that will explain all the variations of the logos right down from what can be included on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7574)|
| 2:06:23| and what can't, you know, down to the colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| We want to be very specific about where those logos are coming from so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7588)|
| 2:06:35| we don't have different shades of blue, different shades of green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| So we're working on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| There are plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| Like I said, there will be several variations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| We equate it to the, you know, UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| We looked at UT as an example for this branding guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| So sometimes you just see the Power T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| Sometimes you see University of Tennessee with the Power T next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| There's going to be various variations of the logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7616)|
| 2:07:02| and those will be explained as to which ones are appropriate for what use in that guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| And you were talking about the color at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| I think the orange is a special dye color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| I think it's like 131 something or something like that for a special dye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| So you're going to have that special dyes for that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| I don't think we created a color for our logo, but it will all be specific colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| So nobody else could pick it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| Did you register it to where somebody else could pick it up and put it on their stuff, or is it just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| I don't think we've copyrighted it, and, you know, I don't think the county owns the color blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| No, I mean the seal itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Oh, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| We haven't gone through that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| I don't know that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| And then the decision to use this came from the mayor's office, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| Sir, he commissioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7675)|
| 2:07:56| Let me ask you this, then, and I'm not poking at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| I'm looking at how money might be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| I know that it costs to make up, you know, letterheads and things like that to go on papers and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7682)|
| 2:08:08| So after the next term, another new mayor comes in, could, in essence, if we don't do anything about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7688)|
| 2:08:17| could come in and change the seal again or change the logo again, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| I guess that's their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| As far as money on this, it was commissioned internally, so there was no extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7707)|
| 2:08:34| It was all done within the regular workflow of the IT department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| And as far as implementation, it's being implemented initially just digitally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7719)|
| 2:08:45| So you'll see it on all the websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| You've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| We're working to get all of the e-mail signatures for all Knox County employees under the mayor's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| I guess it's probably, is it everybody or just the mayor's office for the e-mail signatures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| Anyway, you'll see it under e-mail signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| And then it will be replaced on an as-needed basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| So we're asking nobody to go out and replace what they already have if it doesn't need to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| And the other thing you mentioned about like the websites and things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| why did we do a new website go from .org to .net?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7761)|
| 2:09:27| That's an IT question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| That's an IT question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| Is it for security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| It's still .org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| It's .org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| There's another site that goes for .net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| I see Zach here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| That might be something if you'd like to call Zach to step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| Zach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| That might be the intro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| Intro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| Zach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| That's for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| Zach, please state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| Zach Webb, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| I just noticed because I had to go on that other site and put a picture on that gets my name on the .net site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| So you're referring to two different sites, and there's not been a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| It's just an update on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| So KnoxCounty.org is our external public-facing website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| KnoxGov.net is what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| That's our internal intranet site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| It's always been KnoxGov.net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| We just have refreshed that page and updated it to a new SharePoint page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| So it's just different, but it's the same site address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| I didn't know we had a .net site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| It was very lightly used previously, but we're bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7836)|
| 2:10:37| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| Is there any other discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| Yes, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Rob, I'd like to thank you for using the internal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| not going outside and saving the county taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| And I do like the idea of you all coming up with the color blue and the color green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| because we don't want different shades out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| Good job, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| I just want to say one other thing, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| Why Richie didn't speak up is because I think his school colors out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7868)|
| 2:11:15| is it green out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| Well, one of them is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| I think, Madam Clerk, I want to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| I think we've hit the end of our agenda for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7882)|
| 2:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| I'd also like to make a couple of quick announcements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| and then we'll probably start the zoning meeting just a couple of minutes late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| so everybody's got a little bit of time for a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| But I also want to remind everyone, some of us have been contacted by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| You've got appointments coming up for the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| So please be taking the time to reach out if you have an appointment that's due for BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| We also have, in November, new members of the Ethics Committee will need to be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| So Commissioner Schoonmaker serves as our liaison to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| John, do you want to just give a one-minute thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7919)|
| 2:12:04| I mean, basically, we're going to need to promote this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| and then interview candidates probably in October for their November appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| We'll probably send the notice out about this time next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| so that way everyone will have a 30-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| But I believe we are in the position to fill three appointees, I believe is the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7939)|
| 2:12:25| But I'll double-check that before our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| It may be four total, but I'm not sure how many are commissioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| The mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| And then their term would start on, actually, November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| All right, Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| I wanted to announce about Power of the Purse that is September 19th at Rothschilds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| I'd like to challenge all the commissioners up here to donate a purse out of your wife's closet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7969)|
| 2:12:59| or you could let your wife go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| I'm not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| Hold on, Richie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| Or you could go shopping and purchase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| and you could purchase one for your wife at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=7990)|
