| 0:01:21| Okay, the Chair will entertain a motion to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| The motion is passed, or the minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| Okay, we now have 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=95)|

| 0:01:45| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Yes, I would like to postpone for two weeks 8D and 11G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=109)|
| 0:02:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| 8D is the audit committee and 11G is the one with the electric fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| Okay, the consent items, is there a motion to approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| I'm sorry, are your lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| I missed those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Are those on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Mine's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| I'm not sure of the procedure for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| but since we're going to put these on the consent agenda, which we have routinely done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| I wanted to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| If my colleagues would look at 11O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| I think it illustrates a problem you will be tackling later in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| and that is the fact that there's nothing wrong with the particular item itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| but it illustrates the fact that, in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| we have early retirement rules that can result in retirement at age 50, 53, and a full pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| And it means that over the course of someone's pensioned term after they leave employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| they could be drawing as much as, you know, a million dollars or more over their lifespan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| And these are the rules that we have, and this person earned whatever retirement they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| But I think it illustrates the problem we're going to face downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| that we are going to have to start looking hard at our pension question before the November election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| And that's all I wanted to add to that, and I thought that was probably the opportune time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| I'm not sure if this is the right time, but I'd like to add three items to the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| And those are 12H, I, and J, the emergency ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| Those are the 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| Okay, I need a motion to add them to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| Yes, it is, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| And I will second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| And so this is to add them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| This is the vote to add them to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| They're added to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Now a motion to approve the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Do you still have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Okay, is there a motion to approve the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| I will move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Okay, it's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Okay, it's now time for the Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| I want to welcome you all here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| This is, for many of us, our first really official council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| We had the meeting right after our inauguration just a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| but this is the first one here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| So I want to welcome you all and welcome the new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| and call on the experienced, I'm not going to say the old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| but the experienced council members to help us out here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| and make sure we do everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=327)|

| 0:05:32| and I'm really looking forward to the work we're going to all do together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| We just wrapped up a successful Christmas in the city with the open-air ice rink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| the Regal Celebration of Lights, the WIVK Fowlers Parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| and the Comcast Chill Howie Lights, all great programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| And I want to thank all of our sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| I want to thank our special events staff, including Judith Foltz and her folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| and all the city staff who worked so hard to make these events really a pleasure to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| and a real success in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Also today, the Extreme Makeover Home Edition kicked off in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| I had the pleasure of being in the trailer with the producers watching on the screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| Steve King and I were there, along with Christy and Scott Branscom with Grace Construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| which is the construction company that is doing this with Extreme Makeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| And to see the family, Daniel and Mandy Watson, to see their faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| and to see the excitement was really gratifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| It was really special to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| I want to thank Councilwoman Brenda Palmer, who was, from all I hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| you did a lot of work to try and get this set up properly in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| so that the Extreme Makeover could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| And thank you for all the work that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| I've heard a lot about how you got in there and worked to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Also, I want to thank the police, the fire, public service, engineering and special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| all who have joined with the thousands of volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| and hundreds of businesses that are working to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| Also, as I mentioned, Christy and Scott Branscom, who are with Grace Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| Christy, as you all know, will be joining my staff, I guess at the beginning of February or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| after this Extreme Makeover is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| So we're real proud of her and the work that she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| Councilwoman Palmer, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| I would like to thank the members of Council who, back in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| very blindly agreed to expedite the rezoning so that we could make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| And they were so nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| They asked no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| And Steve King laid a little groundwork for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| But I'd like to thank all of you because that did help make this happen today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| I believe we have some visitors from Nature's Way Montessori School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| Did they make it here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Would you all just stand up for a minute so we can see you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| And the volunteer mentor is Kathy Henschen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=502)|

| 0:08:42| that they will be holding a community roundtable to explain and discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| and to answer any questions from the public about the secondhand store ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| which has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| That meeting will be this coming Tuesday, January 17th, at 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| at the Police Department Training Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| which is at the old Moses School in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| That's at 220 Carrick Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=548)|

| 0:09:17| Again, that's this Tuesday at 6 p.m. at the Moses Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| Madam Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| I just want to note your thought there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| That's going to be important to some of the businesses in town who have a large volume of activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| whether it be selling records or books or something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| and they're trying to work with police and police are trying to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| so that the regulations don't swamp their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| and they achieve their intended purpose of trying to help us sort of track down stolen property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| but not damage the businesses in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| So I want to thank the Police Department for working with the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Let's move on to reports of Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| I have a couple of items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Number one, I was glad to join with the Mayor and several members of Council last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| when we celebrated the opening of an old new fire station on Chapman Highway, Colonial Village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| just above Kay's, if you probably folks are more familiar with that than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| I can't recall the exact address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Maybe Chief knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| But that's due to the growth and the good things that are going on in that portion of the 1st District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| that warrant that fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| And, you know, obviously that's a huge thing for the city of Knoxville there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| I'd like to announce a couple of meetings that we have coming up, as you all are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| Mr. Swanson has changed hats, and he's now the City Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| which leaves us the task of hiring an attorney to represent the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| And we'll have interviews beginning the 19th in this room at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| And then on the 23rd, we'll meet at 5 o'clock in the Small Assembly Room, interviewing applicants for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=664)|
| 0:11:14| And if I may, I would like to introduce Stephanie Welch with the Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| She has a brief report that she'd like to offer the Council this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=679)|
| 0:11:37| Thank you, Mayor Guerrero, and thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Thank you, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I appreciate the opportunity to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| My name is Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| I work at the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| I'm the Chair of the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| I'm here this evening with my colleague, John Dickel, who's the Executive Director of Nutrition at Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| and a member of the Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| We're here basically this evening to let you know what the Food Policy Council is, what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| and what we will be doing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| So just a few slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| We have some handouts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| We'll get those to you in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| But the Food Policy Council, actually our Food Policy Council in Knoxville was the first established in the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| and probably in the universe, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| And we were established in 1982 under then-Mayor Randy Tyree, expanded in 2002 to include the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=744)|
| 0:12:33| We have 11 members, five city appointees, and six county appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| Basically, we're here to keep our eye on the food system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| and that includes everything from how food is produced, how it's grown, how it's distributed, how it's processed, how it's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=763)|
| 0:12:52| We look at consumption patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| We look at also what happens with the waste, food waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| So that's sort of our purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| Thank you, Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| We took over his spot, and he's very kindly advancing slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| If you could move forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| So just wanted to put this up here to show you who our appointed members are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| and to let you know that we do have a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Former council member Chris Woodhull very capably served on the Food Policy Council during his term on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| So as you hear about what we do on Food Policy Council, if it's something that interests you, council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| we would certainly welcome your involvement, and we actually have a vacancy that we need to have filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| So if you just take a look, you can see some of the folks who are involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| And then lastly, yes, Mr. Hagerman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Some of the activities that we've obviously over a 30-year span, there's been a lot that's been accomplished by the Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Over the past couple of years, we've partnered with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| to complete an assessment of food prices across Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| very interesting assessment results that we would be happy to share with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| basically showing that lowest-income communities pay the highest cost for the same food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| We have convened a series of forums on community gardens and gathered that input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| provided that input actually to both city and county departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| We produced a community garden toolkit in cooperation with both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| And what Mr. Dickel is going to speak with you about tonight is a report that we put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| outlining the connections between local food systems and our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Dickel, and if it's okay, if I can just pass out some handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| The next few slides are a result of a study conducted by the Ox Center for Metropolitan Studies in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| and looked at a 100-mile food shed around Chattanooga, including the city of Knoxville and all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=899)|
| 0:15:07| The report that we did, the summary of it is called Food Matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| And what many people don't realize is the impact that they can have as individual consumers on their purchasing that they do in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=912)|
| 0:15:20| A 5 percent increase in local food purchasing, purchasing from local farmers in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| would generate $100 million potentially for the local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| Even for an individual, if they were to spend $100 at a local business in the community versus a national chain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| you would see a dramatic difference in the impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| It has $45 remains in the community out of that $100, where only $13 remains in the community if they go to a local chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=938)|
| 0:15:49| Another surprising figure, which just came from a state of Tennessee economic report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| 27 percent of every dollar spent in retail in the community is for food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| However, only 1 percent of gross domestic product of Tennessee is agriculturally based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=961)|
| 0:16:10| I love this picture here that shows a potato in Idaho that traveled 1,785 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| and a carrot that traveled 1,838 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| That's the typical distance for these two food items to come to our table here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| For example, Knox County Schools, we spent approximately $1.2 million this year in produce, fresh produce for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=986)|
| 0:16:35| Yet only about $300,000 of that was grown locally because federal regulations prohibit us from being able to expand those purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=995)|
| 0:16:43| and use those dollars for locally grown produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| All the while, we have farmers that are within 30 to 100 miles of us that grow those same potatoes and carrots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1007)|
| 0:16:56| As you can see, the demand for locally grown produce has improved dramatically in locally produced foods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1016)|
| 0:17:04| and the local farmers markets have seen an impact in growth and sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| and the retail marketing has been increased dramatically by the locally grown produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1030)|
| 0:17:19| So what can we do as consumers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| We can support policies that direct businesses that purchase locally grown goods to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| There are many local grocery stores that purchase locally grown produce, and that's what we do in Knox County Schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| We can support policies that increase agricultural production by farmers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| support policies that provide incentives for farmers growing fresh fruits and vegetables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| and support policies to increase urban and community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| We're real excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| We actually are getting to celebrate the 30th anniversary of our Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| We're hosting an Eat, Play, Live event here in Knoxville on March 9th and 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| It's helping people become involved in local food, active outdoor spaces, and support of healthy living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| and we'll have more information about that coming in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| And if you have any more questions for us, we're available, and if you'd like to send us an e-mail or have any other thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| Yes, I wanted to remind everyone about the Martin Luther King Week of activities coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| I don't have the schedule before me, but I know that on tomorrow there's an interfaith service, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| at First Christian Church, and then the luncheon on Thursday, and, of course, the parade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| and the service on Monday at Greater Warner Tabernacle, and invite everybody to come out and participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Mayor, I'd like to bring to council's attention and also your attention the fact that in District No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1142)|
| 0:19:10| 2 there's an illegal dump that has been operating for some time taking shingles, roofing shingles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1150)|
| 0:19:19| and I know that with you folks just getting involved and starting that this will be something that I know that you'll be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1159)|
| 0:19:28| into to see what can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| But the property is located out on Lexington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| It's kind of part of the finger annexation that occurred, you know, with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| But a number of the businesses that surround this particular piece of property have contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| There's a major drainage ditch, a 48-inch ditch, that runs through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| I have photos and pictures that can show you what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| The drainage ditch itself, there's only about 16 inches that are clear now that can flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| And we have all the asphalt shingles and everything stacking up all around this drainage ditch area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| Also, there was a fire out there this weekend that we found out later that rural metro ended up responding to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| even though it was a city piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| We have a great concern not only for the health and safety of the firemen and the folks that are in the immediate area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| but I think we also have a great concern for the health of all of us in this community in terms of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| And we're not quite sure what's going to happen, where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| But we do know that it's illegally being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| There are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| There's also one in Councilman Brown's district right off Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| These dumps are growing, in some cases 20, 25 feet high with shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| I did ask if Tom Reynolds, with the building official, could come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| and maybe just give us a brief history about what has happened out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Actually, Mr. Reynolds has asked that I respond to that because we're very closely monitoring this and have been involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1262)|
| 0:21:12| And I can assure you that the administration is well aware of what is happening at both of these locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| have been aware of it for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| There are a number of enforcement policies and procedures that are being reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| and we are somewhat disheartened that the enforcement process that has already taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| has not been successful in abating this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| That is discouraging to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| We are exploring all of our available options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| There was a meeting this morning with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| There will be further meetings very, very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| And I can assure you that further enforcement activity will occur in the very near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| and we are aware of it and will continue to be aware of it and take appropriate action with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| I would prefer not to say more than that simply because the enforcement action is going to be underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| and, frankly, we'd just as soon not provide a roadmap to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| If you can just keep us posted so that I can let the constituents know, you know, what's going on, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| I'd be very happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Any other reports of counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1348)|

| 0:23:05| to the Board of Environmental Appeals for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1392)|

| 0:23:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1394)|

| 0:23:27| to use loan funds exclusively to provide permanent financing to eligible low-income families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| receiving construction financing and other subsidies from the city's housing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Is there any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1424)|

| 0:23:46| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| 11B is a resolution to accept a white paper prepared by the Mayor's Council on Disability Issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| regarding the proposed closure of Lakeshore Mental Health Institute by the State of Tennessee in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Madam Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Yes, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| I'd like to speak to this before we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| This white paper has been prepared by the Council on Disability Issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| and they've spent a great deal of time expressing concern and some potential scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| what ifs, in regard to the proposed closing of Lakeshore Mental Health Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| I've read through the report carefully, as I'm sure my constituents have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| and applaud the interest and the actions of this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| However, I'm greatly concerned not only about the closing of Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| but also the implications of this white paper if we move to accept this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| The reason is that, as this is picked up by various groups in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| I have the distinct impression from comments I received today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| that this will appear to be an endorsement by your administration, by City Council, of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| And while there are many ideas in this report that, as we all work to a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| if and when Lakeshore is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| I really think that accepting this white paper tonight would be very premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| So I would encourage us to table this until we see, A, what the legislature is going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1513)|
| 0:25:21| B, exactly what the Commissioner Varney has in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| C, how much money we're going to have available to do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| if there is any money available, if there's not, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| So I would encourage my colleagues to discuss this and think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I second what my colleague has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I've been in touch with the Commissioner's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| and I feel very much the way you do in terms of if we accept this, what we're really saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| And I do agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| There's a lot of good points in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| but I think that an endorsement might send the message one way or the other on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| I would like to see it also tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| I guess I'd like to start with a question to Mr. Swanson, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Is there a practice of accepting white papers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| I've not seen this thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| And what is the normal drill with a presentation like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| Historically, the City Council has received, has accepted a number of reports, papers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| things of that sort from various groups and organizations simply as an indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| that they have received whatever report or whatever document it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| And it certainly should be clear that the acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| or receiving of such a report does not amount to necessarily an approval of that document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| nor an endorsement of the things contained therein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| It is simply that they have received it and are aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| and often express some gratitude to those who have prepared it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| whether or not council necessarily agrees with all that's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| So there is some history of receiving or accepting reports in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| but it's something that's within council's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| The reason I ask that is I didn't know where we're going to end up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| whether we defer acting on this or whether we act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| But if we do, I think we should change the language in Section 1 to say that we thank Cody for its work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| and accept for review or further review the white paper instead of giving the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| that Councilman Palmer is concerned about is an endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| My concern about this subject matter is that the current plan looks like a, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1662)|
| 0:27:50| a wise economic choice on the part of the state, at least it's being presented that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| to close Lakeshore and substitute bucking up or shoring up local services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| The danger, of course, becomes that they're your friends for a year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| and then they cut the budget and you're stuck with the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| So I guess we'd like to see it aired more in the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| and make sure there is some way for that approach to have more continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| But, again, I agree with the notion that we are grateful that these people have taken the time to prepare this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| and to educate us and our city about what's going on and what they see as the positive aspect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| So if we do move forward, we should change the language in Section 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Yeah, and I, too, am going to support Councilwoman Palmer's motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| I mean, just for example, under the Executive Summary Recommendation 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| the City of Knoxville should do its own resource analysis of the potential cost of Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| I mean, I don't know where that money comes from or where those resources come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| So, you know, I appreciate the hard work that's gone on to present this to us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| but they just today started herding cats in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| So I think we need to wait and see how that herding goes a little further down the line before we take, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| accept this or move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| I don't disagree with my colleagues, but I did make the motion to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| because I think, in fact, it addresses the questions you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| And so if we accept this, I think it raises many of the issues that have already been expressed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| and I would, of course, encourage us to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Now, nobody seconded my motion, so it may be moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| And I think, quite frankly, the administration can pursue this stuff perhaps without us accepting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| but it might at least bolster the administration's effort if we were to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| I was just going to say I would move to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| You know, the law director was telling us that this doesn't lock us into anything per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| We're just accepting the paper as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| You know, I'm sure, and knowing that a lot of people are concerned about the issues, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| it's not making the city do anything, and I know there are some issues with where it's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| and that will present itself in due time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| Accepting this paper doesn't change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| I wanted to ask Councilwoman Palmer, were you making a motion in your statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| Yes, I was, moving that we table this, which, of course, means that it can come out at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1842)|
| 0:30:50| As we see the scenario at the state level unfold and have a better idea, then we can bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1850)|
| 0:30:59| And there are certainly some really positive things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| and I applaud this group for undertaking this task at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| The reason I have suggested tabling it rather than accepting it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| in the two years that I've been on Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I've seen us take some actions that we thought would be somewhat in the spirit of accepting a white paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1874)|
| 0:31:25| but when the community looks at what we've done, the headline and the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| was not necessarily intent or the spirit that we demonstrated when we were accepting something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1890)|
| 0:31:37| So I'm not saying let's reject this forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| I'm just saying let's put it on hold until we see a little bit more about what's going to unfold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| and it could come off of the table any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| It does not have to be six months from now, 12 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| It could come out next week if that was what we so desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| I'll second her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| We have a motion and a second to table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| and that takes precedence over the Councilman Saunders' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Can I add a friendly amendment to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| Friendly amendment to the motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Can we somehow say that we are grateful for what the group has done and that we appreciate that effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| Certainly you can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| It doesn't have any legal impact on the motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| But you get a warm fuzzy at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| We have a motion and a second to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Design and Construction Services, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| for the 2012 curb cut project in an amount not to exceed $586,249.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1981)|
| 0:33:11| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I would second that, but I do have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| I guess, Mr. King, kind of enlarge on this, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| This is kind of a broad brush at fixing curb cuts, which I favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| But I don't know where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Is there some priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Is there some way that we decide what to do when and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| We typically use our resurfacing schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| We found through advice from our law department that we need to make sure we upgrade a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| and an ADA curb cut in conjunction with street paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| We also work closely with Stephanie, who gives us information concerning particular needs regarding ADA curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2037)|
| 0:34:07| If there's someone who lives on a bus route that has trouble getting to that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| then she gives us that information and we include it in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| Is this also coordinated, and I assume it must be, with sidewalk repair, sidewalk expansion, whatever that schedule may be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2057)|
| 0:34:26| Well, any time we expand a sidewalk or repair one, we would bring it up to the current ADA standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2066)|
| 0:34:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Yeah, Steve, as long as they're answering questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| I understand this contract is built on unit prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| which means that if you do have a change in approach to the number of curb cuts or sidewalk repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| or the various items that add up the tactile warning system item that's one of the big items, that will adjust the total price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Well, I think what you're saying, if we add additional intersections or subtract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| then it would modify the total cost of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Is it your intention at this point to sort of stick to this ballpark at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| In other words, we're tackling the capital improvement budget as we authorize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Is this a fair shot at what we're going to spend this coming year on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| Yes, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Oftentimes things come up during the course of the contract where we may add or subtract to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| But if we found a particular need and we had the funding that we would coordinate with finance on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| then we might add some additional intersections if it became appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| Okay, we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute change order number two to contract number C090257| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| between the City of Knoxville and Wilbur Smith Associates for the Holbrook Drive Bridge Replacement Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| to increase the contract price by $36,800 for a new contract price of $415,984| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| and to extend the date of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| I'm going to support this, but I did want to ask a question because as I understand the Wilbur Smith outfit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2186)|
| 0:36:34| they are doing the front end, what, design sort of work for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| Are we going to see a separate contract adjustment for the bridge building itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| In other words, this is the engineer's part of the whole task, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| We haven't bid the construction portion of that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| You haven't bid the part of the job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| No, this is a change order to the design contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| And I noticed in there, for example, I mean, KUB was going to move some poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| so you need lighting devices and that type of thing that you're adding to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Do you have an estimate of the overall project yet, or you won't know until you get your bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I do have an estimate, but I don't have it on top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Like I said, I will move to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| We have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Shelton General Contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| for the Beaumont Elementary Sidewalk Improvements Project in an amount not to exceed $103,435.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| And we have someone who's also signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Do you want to hear that person now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Stephanie Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| I'm back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| I live at 2137 Hillsborough Heights, and thank you again, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| I took off my nutrition hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| I'm putting on the physical activity hat to talk a little bit about this project and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| this relates to some work that's going on in our community around Safe Routes to School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| So I'm representing the Safe Routes to School Partnership, which is a partnership of both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| city and county governments and a variety of community organizations, including, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| We work together basically to improve child health and the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| So Safe Routes to School, finding alternatives to motorized transportation to get kids to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| and from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| We have worked over the past several years in conjunction with city engineering and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| county engineering to prioritize school sites and to seek grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| So the funding that's coming down for this particular project is actually federal transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| dollars that's being distributed through TDOT to the city of Knoxville to improve walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| around Beaumont Elementary School, where a large portion of the children actually already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| are walking, but probably not in the greatest of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| So this is a much-needed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| In conjunction with the infrastructure projects and the funding that this grant provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| we're also providing education beginning next week, doing walk-to-school day events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| There'll be a bear out there, a guy dressed up in a bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| We're doing little competitions with incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| We'll be doing a bike rodeo coming up this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| KPD, thank you, is already, obviously, enforcing around school zones, but they'll be upping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| the enforcement around Beaumont this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| So just wanted to let you know a little bit about the context of this project and thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| some of the partners who have been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Thanks to city engineering and county engineering, parks and recreation, Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2390)|

| 0:40:12| City Connections and the Health Department where I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| You left out the taxpayers of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| Obviously, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Obviously, taxpayers not only in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| This is federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| So taxpayers across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Thank you, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2426)|

| 0:40:30| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I really applaud this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| I know that Beaumont does have a lot of students who do walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| I did a little math on this because this project started in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| So when those kids were in kindergarten in 2008 and then it's gone on to 2009, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| Now in 2011, when we're finally close to doing something, they're in third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| If we continue this pace, they will be in middle school before the sidewalks are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| So I just wanted to say that I hope that we can speed this up a little bit so that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| can walk on these new sidewalks before they get to middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Councilman Graven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Stephanie, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| I noticed that what Councilwoman Palmer was talking about, the grant was established in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| Are there other grants that are in the horizon there or a possibility of more grants for more schools in our area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| There are grants that have been submitted, but we're waiting actually on word from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| Councilman Dallobalfi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| If I could ask Mr. King or Mr. Hagerman, whoever is going to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| Of course, this raises the question that I know constituents in every district are going to ask is how do we rank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| order these projects and build them because there are schools that don't have the full mile of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| within the parental, you know, responsibility zones and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| And I know that you can't do everything at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| but could you explain just briefly how we go about deciding which projects get the nod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| Actually, Ms. Welch might want to comment on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| But briefly, let me say that this is a process that involves the school, our transportation organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| Some schools have not shown an interest in applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Some years we haven't been able to drum up any interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| But it takes a commitment on the school to be involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| The second part, I guess, of the question is I noticed that the curb and sidewalk money in this is about $22,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| but there's a whole lot of other stuff that always comes up with construction and you've got grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| and all kinds of drainage issues and stuff that all add up to real costs when you go to build something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| I guess my question is, aside from this federal grant process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| are we looking at some simple asphalt-type greenways that might meander in that mile of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2589)|
| 0:43:18| responsibility zone that we can build and they look like a skinny driveway and are less expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| and the water just flows over them and you mow over them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| and you don't do all this curb and gutter improvement, which is very expensive and time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| We have looked at it both ways, as I think you and I have discussed this several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| But what ends up happening when you meander the path, whether it's made out of asphalt or concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| you end up having to buy more property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| So you balance that between construction costs and the cost of typically it's buying a portion of someone's front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2628)|
| 0:43:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| But in some cases, you have road right-of-way that's broader than the paved easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| I mean, the paved surface itself, the right-of-way is broader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| and you might have shoulder that you could put something like that on, couldn't you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| Typically, I mean, almost always, the right-of-way is wider than the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| But you still have to deal with the water that flows along the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| So you pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| If you pave more adjacent to the street, then you've got a crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| That pushes the roadside ditch farther away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| So you've got more runoff and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| You still end up having to acquire or purchase some property from a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| That's something that we can analyze on a case-by-case basis as the administration and council funds a section of sidewalk in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2675)|
| 0:44:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| And I know that there's much more demand than we can satisfy in any given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| We build a mile or two at most, and neighborhoods everywhere want to see sidewalks and safe places to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2690)|
| 0:44:58| So if we can find a way to get more bang for our buck, please do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| I just want to say I'm glad to see this because we have a problem with childhood obesity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| and just the simple act of being able to walk to school is going to be very helpful in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| So I'm hoping that we can get the sidewalks going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| I just wanted to make an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2729)|

| 0:47:08| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| If I could ask, I don't know, Mr. Wetzel or Mr. Lyons, someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| Mr. Wetzel is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| We are looking at asking KCDC to kind of review this redevelopment plan and area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2838)|
| 0:47:26| Do I understand we have not at this point, if we approve this, committed one way or another to a TIF or any further action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| This is the first step in the process, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| We send it off to them and they'll do an analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| There will be a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| There will be a fair amount of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| And then if that moves through that process, it will come back to you at a later date if we want to create a redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| and if so, if we want to have a TIF associated with that redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| And I know you're very good at being proactive with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Do you plan any series of meetings, public meetings, in the Cumberland Avenue area that might be affected by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| or the road narrowing we're going to do and all those questions that are on everyone's mind in terms of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| how it fits in with our Cumberland project and survival of local businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| If this resolution passes tonight, which I hope that it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| then we will get with KCDC to kind of map out our plan and how we go forward with communicating with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| They have a required public hearing, but we can do other hearings and meetings beside that if we choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| Well, just to dovetail off that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| I'll say we had a little preliminary two-hour meeting Saturday with folks in Fort Sanders to, you know, talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2914)|
| 0:48:43| So it's, you know, work's begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| And I know that Mr. Wetzel goes around the post a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| He's been there before, and he tries to be inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| So I just want to be sure where we are in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| I'll make sure he's sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| I just wanted to add to that that the Bearden Council will be discussing this also, so it is in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2944)|

| 0:49:24| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Just as a matter of interest to the people that live in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| maybe Steve King or Mr. Wetzel, someone can step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| We are, in essence, doing some advanced work to help us redevelop this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| and we're looking at the environmental hazards from brownfields and yesteryear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| and all that in this particular corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Is that what this is about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| And S&ME is going to do some of the exploratory testing and drilling and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Ann Wallace is going to manage this project for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| She can give you more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| It's very similar to the one we've done in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| It's preparatory to future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| We did it along the waterfront so that if we had sort of a customer developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| we'd be ready to turn over property that could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| The best example we have in downtown north now is the Brookside Mills site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| A similar project was done on this several years ago that got it prepared for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| When a buyer came up, he knew exactly what he had to do to develop that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| So we're going to try to get some other sites ready like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| So we're a smart city with brownfields, and we're getting ready to market them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Okay, we have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Waste Connections of Tennessee, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| for the collection, disposal, and recycling of solid waste from various city government locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| for an estimated annual total of $80,000 per year dependent upon volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| We have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Item A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 17, Article 6, Division 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| to permit multiple space parking meters and additional payment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Mr. King, you and I somewhat touched on this this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| I've had some people ask me some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| They're not quite sure what this means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| In just everyday normal person, not engineer terms, could you kind of summarize this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3098)|
| 0:51:48| Like I don't do that always for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Sometimes I don't listen as well as you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| A multimeter is simply another way that we can do parking meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3115)|
| 0:52:03| per spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| There would be a location where you might have a location or have a bank of meters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| or a meter that would service, say, one side of the street for a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| So you would park your car, note the number of a space, walk to the multimeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| and either pay by credit card, debit card, or coin, or paper money, and then you're set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3145)|
| 0:52:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| So this does mean that there would be multiple choice payment methods other than points that I don't ever have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| And that's one of the reasons for the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Our current ordinance only allows coins and requires a meter per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| I understand. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Councilman Dallavalpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| What about the unsophisticated of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| If we pull up to a spot and don't see no pipe with a meter on it, we think we're good to park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| Is there going to be enough information for the public not to get that big ticket when they come back from their little outing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| Well, as you know, we struggle with how many signs are enough and how many are too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3189)|
| 0:53:17| But there will be a need to communicate that to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| so a person knows that you're in a multimeter area and you need to go to a particular location to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3201)|
| 0:53:30| You need to go down to Staples and get you one of them templates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| and spray paint the curb C meter or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| We have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Motion is ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| 12B is an ordinance to close Phillip-Fulmer Way from Cumberland Avenue to Lake Loudoun Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| University of Tennessee Applicant First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Madam Mayor, could we not combine B, C and D since they're essentially the same, just different names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| It would probably be better when you're closing streets, actually, to do them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| It would be more efficient but probably better for the record to close them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| Well, then I would move that we accept B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| I guess we could discuss them all at the same time and get that over with, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| I guess just get it out there that I guess UT is building a lot of stuff down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| the new student union and everything, and wants control of these streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Mr. King or Mr. Donaldson or someone, is that what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| Do they want to be able to alter the activity there on those streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| or is there some other reason why this is happening now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| I'll take a crack at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| In the short term, they've been using the streets as staging areas as they renovate and upgrade Neyland Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| so they've found it necessary to shut down the streets on multiple occasions for an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| But in the long range, they've recently adopted a master plan for the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| and are calling for an upgraded boulevard street section on Phillip Fulmer Way, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3315)|
| 0:55:24| and want to be able to complete that at their own rate according to the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3324)|
| 0:55:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Now, if I could ask Mr. King one question, and that is one of these maps, I think it was the third of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| That's T. Martin Drive or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| It looks like it's the spot where some other engineering group you hired was going to put the pedestrian bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| if we ever build the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Is that not so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| I was just wondering if the road closures will impact any other project that you know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| You're shaking your head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Is that a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| I'm not aware that it would affect any other project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Vice Mayor Pavley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| I have never been in a meeting where we've discussed parking meters twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| but we're going to do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| So my question is I know up and down some of those boulevards there are parking meters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| and so my question is who is the beneficiary of those meters and who will continue to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| or will they go away, or what will happen to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Well, currently the City of Knoxville is the beneficiary of the meters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| and also has the responsibility to main and collect the money in the event that the right-of-way is closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| and the city will issue maybe I'm speaking for Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| but typically the city issues a quick claim deed to adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| which in all these cases would be the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| and that property would no longer be the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| and the university could choose to use meters or whatever they chose or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| Any idea just what the physical impact is per meter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| not necessarily there but just anywhere, just out of curiosity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| No, I really don't in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| I would estimate that the cost to the city of maintaining a street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| and storm drainage systems and sidewalks would far exceed revenue that we might get from parking meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3435)|
| 0:57:24| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| I noticed that an individual from the university is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| One of the questions I have, which is out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| is that if we're doing away with Phillip Fulmer Way, Peyton Manning Pass, and T. Martin Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| are those going to be renamed somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Are we picking who we're doing away with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Jeff Maples with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| In answer to your question, there are no plans to change the names of those streets at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Our plans are, as mentioned earlier, is being predicated by our master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| which was approved by our board of trustees last year in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| We have numerous projects that will be taking place along that area in the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| And it's beneficial for the university and the city to go ahead and transfer ownership of those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| But as far as renaming the streets, we have no plans to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| Four Lane Boulevard will still be Phillip Fulmer Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| Yes, the plans are to expand Phillip Fulmer Way into Four Lane Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| That's probably five to ten years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Since we got back to the parking meters, I want to ask Mr. King if those meters that we just voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| where you can use debit cards, if that works well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| will we see those types of meters throughout the city probably in the future, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| Well, I think we will have the opportunity to look at that in other locations in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| There will be some interest in that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| And I know we've talked with members in Dr. Lyons' area, Mr. Wetzel, and Ms. Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3534)|
| 0:59:03| and other folks about the expansion of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| And I think we'll take that a step at a time, but you could see more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Mr. King, those multi-parking meters have a price on them, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| They're expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| And that will be something that we will, city staff collectively, will need to set a parking rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| And we will coordinate with various staff members, but including Mr. York in finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| to make sure that all this works financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Well, the ones that are on the way will be recycled, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| We're not offering a quick clean deed before we take our meters down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| No, we would go get the meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| We'll go get our meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Yeah, as long as we have the UT rep here, I was going to ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| do you have any plans to name a street, a dead-end street, Lane Kiffin dead-end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3593)|
| 1:00:01| I prefer not to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| I was going to say, you don't have to answer that, Mr. Macon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| We have a motion, but we need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3613)|

| 1:00:52| 12E is an ordinance to rezone property located on the north side of South Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| south side of North Middlebrook Pike, west side of Henson Road from I-2 District to C-6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| Gerald Bourse applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| I have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Does C-6 zoning allow the person to sell automobiles at that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| Let me look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| I looked and I couldn't make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Isn't that C-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Yeah, C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| That property has currently been selling automobiles at that location two or three at a time under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| the other zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Well, it refers back to the C-3 District, which both C-3 and C-6 mention auto service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3703)|
| 1:02:08| and repair places but not sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| So if currently that property is being used for auto service and repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| this would not allow them to continue to sell two or three cars at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Reading down the list, I come then to under C-6, automobile and truck sales and service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3743)|
| 1:02:32| including the sales and service of any accessories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3761)|

| 1:03:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| Would you like to make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3793)|

| 1:03:33| Sam Furrow Applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3813)|
| 1:03:42| Councilwoman Palmer, and again, Mr. Donaldson, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| Is this the property where the shingles are currently being stored?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| It's right above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| If you look on your zoning map, parcel number 66.32 is the area that's being used for the storage of waste shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3835)|
| 1:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Yeah, if I could ask one question, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| Mr. Donaldson, tell me about the technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| Are we affecting that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| We're going to keep the overlay but simply change the interior zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| The T01 overlay stays in place and the base zoning will change underneath that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| but any development on that property would be subject to development plan approval by the TTCDA in conformity with the guidelines that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3886)|
| 1:04:56| So that's designed to have some quality technology corridor, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Has anyone signed up to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Is there anyone who wishes to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| I'll second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| That brings us now to public forum, and we do have two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| First is David Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| If you would come forward and say your name and your address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| And you have five minutes, Mr. Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you, Madam Mayor, members of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| My name is David Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| My address is in Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| I'm here on behalf of a business owner in Knoxville, and he has a number of colleagues here with him tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3951)|
| 1:06:00| and they are very concerned about the ordinance that the council has enacted pertaining to the regulation of dealers in scrap metals and coins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3960)|
| 1:06:11| which you made the announcement about earlier this evening, about the meeting next Tuesday, I believe, at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| I'm sure that meeting will be attended by my client and the people who are concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3978)|
| 1:06:26| We didn't know about that until we got here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| and they have wanted me to come tonight to let the council know that they are very concerned about the burdens this ordinance is going to impose on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=3989)|
| 1:06:40| Some of the requirements regarding photographing of items and certain record keeping and reporting are going to really cost them a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4000)|
| 1:06:52| and some of them have been thinking, if we understand what we're going to be required to do by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| we're not going to be able to afford to keep our businesses in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| And a lot of these businesses have been of longstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| These people are here tonight, and they might want to just raise their hands or do something to indicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| These are all people who have businesses in your communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| They have business licenses, and they're quite concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| And we hope the council will not only assist in educating them about what the intent behind this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| And I will say I'm a little bit, you know, being an attorney, I'm not here on an adversarial basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| I understand that this is a legitimate area of regulation, that there are a lot of concerns about this type of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| But it is going to have a big effect on these business owners, and it could impact businesses of longstanding in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| So we hope that if there need to be some adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| that the council will be open to considering reasonable modifications that would still protect your interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4074)|
| 1:08:02| but also not cause these businesses to have to shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| Thank you, Mr. Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Thank you for coming, Mr. Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Our police chief has been very upfront about saying that they want this to work for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| and so they are holding these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| But we have had other Knoxville businessmen come and say we like the intent of finding a way to stop, you know, fencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4100)|
| 1:08:29| stolen goods and whatnot, but their volume is such that it would be a cost burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| So we're looking to the chief to work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| If we need to make changes, we'll want to hear back from you or your people about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| But I think the intent is to try to work it out and get it on a happy keel, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120110?start=4129)|
