| 0:02:46| Hi, I'm William Walker, and I'm representing Troop 147 from West Hills Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| I'm Austin Mayes, and I'm also representing Troop 147 from West Hills Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| Great. Would all the troops stand, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=179)|

| 0:03:09| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| So summer is ending. I don't know if you realize that with the 90 degree weather that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| But with that, our summer season at our outdoor pools is also ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| So what we have a tradition, when we close out the pools, we have a doggy dip at the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=204)|
| 0:03:33| So this will be at NSKIPP Pool this Sunday, September 7th, from 1 to 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| You can't bring your dogs through the year, but at the very end, we have the doggy dip day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| Is there flea powder floating on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| I don't know. Where's Joe? He can explain more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| Each person can bring a maximum of two dogs, and the cost is $3 per dog, or per entrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| Is an entrant a dog or a person who brings them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| Per person and per dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| Oh, per person and per dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| What about cats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| No, this is just a doggy dip day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| We'll be hearing from cat people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| We'll need to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| We'll be hearing from the cat people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| So Powell Animal Hospital will be on site with giveaways and door prizes, including certificates for veterinary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| And you can find out more about this and registration form on the Parks and Recreation page of our city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| Again, that's this Sunday at NSKIPP Swimming Pool at 4204 Bruin Road, and it's from 1 to 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=275)|
| 0:04:44| That should be fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| I also want to make sure that everybody knows about an event that's coming up in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| It's still a month off, but we want to get the word out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| The city is presenting the third annual East Tennessee Accessibility Symposium from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| on Friday, October 3rd at the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| I don't know if you all think we've talked about this in the past, but it's been a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| It's organized by Stephanie Cook, our city's ADA coordinator, and a lot of co-sponsors on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| It showcases ways to create physical access for people with disabilities and for senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| how to design for it, how beneficial it is, and how easy and affordable it can be to provide accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| when it is taken into account during the design phase of a building or project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| And people with disabilities and our seniors combined make up nearly half of our population currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| This means that a lot of people in our community depend on a built environment that is accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| So the city is proud to offer an opportunity to learn about true accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| and why it is important to all of us and really some real design ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| The early bird rate to attend has been extended until this Friday, September 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| and the final registration date is September 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| All event details can be found on the city's website as well as a link to the online registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| Next Thursday is September 11th, and of course this is the 13th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| And as has become tradition, the city and county will hold a memorial service starting at 8.42 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| right out here in the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| This will pay tribute to all of those who lost their lives that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| and give thanks for the service of all of our emergency responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| Now that is awesome. I'm about to talk about the Medal of Honor convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Unfortunately, there's a conflict with the opening ceremony, opening event with the Medal of Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| It coincides with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| So Mayor Burchett and I will be at the Medal of Honor conference or convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| welcoming all of our guests to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| And our chiefs, David Roush and Stan Sharp, will be representing me at the 9-11 service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| So I just want you all to know I won't be there, but my heart will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| and it's an important thing for us to remember annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| So again, back to the Medal of Honor convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| As you all know, we are one of the official sponsors of this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| You all approved a sizable donation towards that not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| And there is a great committee that has been working on this for probably a year and a half maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| maybe close to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| We competed, and we received the honor of hosting the Medal of Honor convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| The last year or so, there have been several different Medal of Honor recipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| who have been to town for different events to kind of build up to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| So we are honored as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| So I hope all of our residents, when there will be a nice-sized crowd that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| when you see them out, that we go up to them, welcome them to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| and make sure they know how much we appreciate them for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| For more information on the events, their school visits and other events that are planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=485)|

| 0:10:42| And, yeah, they did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Thank you for recognizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| I want to call everyone's attention to that Whittlesprings Golf Course is back open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| after an unfortunate situation turned into a really good win-win for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| We lost our greens out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| They were old greens and now have been replaced with Bermuda greens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| which long term this will be a real benefit for sustainability that you're very interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| Playability will be outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| In six weeks, you've got new greens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Billy Casper Golf, who manages our two golf courses, Knoxville Municipal and Whittlesprings, did an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| Brian Loveday and his staff took responsibility for an unfortunate situation that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| and really came to the rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| So kudos for Joe Walsh and his management of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| And I think long term it will really see increased play at Whittlesprings for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| So the greens are greener in that they have used less water, less herbicides and pesticides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=710)|

| 0:12:06| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville by amending Article 13 of said Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| entitled Pensions to clarify and correct certain language within the definitional section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=732)|

| 0:12:51| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| I will mention to those in the audience and anyone who may be watching at home that this and the next four items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| are all the pension reform amendments and they're quite lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| And if there's not much debate it's because we've had a council workshop and full debate at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=791)|

| 0:13:20| entitled Pensions to permit the supplemental plan provisions as reviewed by the Pension Board and approved by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=800)|

| 0:13:44| 9C is an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville by amending Article 13 of said Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| entitled Pensions to permit the supplemental plan provisions as reviewed by the Pension Board and approved by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| to allow members of Division G and H nearing their normal retirement age to irrevocably elect alternative methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| for crediting earnings of the Division G Individual Accounts and Division H Hypothetical Accounts as applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| and further providing for the submission of this ordinance to the qualified voters of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Yeah, this one is a little harder to grasp from the language of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| and I realize it's being deferred in the sense that the supplemental plan can be looked at in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=864)|
| 0:14:33| But I don't know if Jim's here, but if I understand correctly, what we're talking about here is that as people in Division G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=873)|
| 0:14:42| and H who have individual sort of investment accounts as part of their retirement thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| at two years or less left in their career, they can sit down and apparently elect irrevocably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=888)|
| 0:14:56| to perhaps put their investment in something safer like a bond or some item like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| I see Jim here, but maybe you can give us just a short touch of what this is supposed to address as a big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| Jim York, Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| What this refers to, and, again, a lot of people don't realize this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| but there has been a hybrid plan for general government for about the last 15 or 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| There are a few people who have both a defined benefit portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| That's a lower portion than the ones who take the full defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| There is also a defined contribution piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| But the investments for that defined contribution piece are not self-directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| They flow with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| And what this proposes is to allow those individuals who are both in G1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| and future plan H employees who will have a hypothetical defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| to opt into a more risk-free or risk-adverse plan going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=962)|
| 0:16:13| And, again, most people as they're near retirement wish to opt out of more risky investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=973)|
| 0:16:22| into less risky investments, and this provides a vehicle for doing that standard practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| Again, just in the interest of full disclosure, this would be one that I could potentially apply for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| and I want people to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| So there is no bias there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| And the individual election on that would occur within two years of the date of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| You wouldn't make that election for the more conservative investment until you're within two years of the date of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| It gives them a chance to preserve the principal or the nest egg and less market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| But, again, this only enables us to make that decision whether to enact that kind of provision in the supplemental plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| It's just hard to get that from reading this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| It crosses your eyes just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Just a tad bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1033)|

| 0:19:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Frank Slegel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| for apartments in the RP2 planned residential district property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| located on the west side of Thunderhead Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| north of South North Shore Drive, Flournoy Development, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| So this is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| So as you all know, the process is that we start with the appellants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| and they can have up to three speakers for a maximum of five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| We only have one person signed up, Mr. Frank Slegel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| and then we follow that with the respondents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| and we do have three people signed up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| And then the appellant, Mr. Slegel, can choose to have up to two-minute rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| if he chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| So, Mr. Slegel, we will start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| You're going to be the only speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Everybody else is worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Let me get my timer going and state your name and address for the record, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| My name is Frank Slegel, and my address is 1924 White Aram Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| Tonight we are asking you to uphold our appeal of the approval by MPC of the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| on review application for 246 apartments on 10 acres in North Shore Town Center by Flournoy Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| We've maintained for the past 15 months that we believe this is too big of a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| for this small of a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Having been unsuccessful in our attempts so far to alter the course of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| we have now petitioned Chancery Court to consider our objections to this plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| First of all, that this plan is in direct contradiction to the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| We also contend that none of the conditions necessary to justify a change in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| as outlined in General Plan 2033 were satisfied, and therefore the sector plan change was unwarranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| Secondly, that the rezoning of this property should be considered illegal spot zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| because it involves a, quote, small parcel of land for use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| totally different from that of the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| for the benefit of an owner of such property and to the detriment of other owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and as such is the very antithesis of plan zoning, end quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| as spot zoning has been defined by the Tennessee Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Thirdly, that this plan cannot be approved and a legal building permit cannot be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| because of the location of this site on North Shore Drive, which is a designated scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| as stated in Tennessee Code 5417.114,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| and therefore this site is subject to the building height restrictions set forth in Tennessee Code 5417.115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| In their use on review hearing on July 10th, Dan Kelly of MPC said, and quoting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| I stated early on in the discussion, in order to be able to proceed with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| you have to understand the Tennessee Scenic Highway Act has height limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| and these buildings, as proposed, do not meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| However, the Tennessee Scenic Highway Act also has an option in there that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| if the property is zoned TC1 or C6 or a similar zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| that the Planning Commission has the option to review those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| We don't see anywhere in this statute that the Planning Commission has the option to review the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| under any circumstances, and the or similar phrase at the very end of the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| refers only to the land between Keller Bend Road and Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| If it was, as MPC has stated, any property on North Shore Drive between Lakeshore Park and Loudoun County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| could be exempt if it was determined to be in a zone similar to TC1 or C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| We're sure that that was not the intent of the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| and are confident Chancellor Pridemore will interpret this statute as we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| In addition, we believe there have been numerous procedural errors in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| and any one of these could be grounds for overturning the ordinances passed by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| to allow the sector plan change, the one-year plan change, and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| If the court holds that even one of our contentions is worthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| it can unravel everything that has been done by MPC and City Council over the past 15 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| as it relates to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| We don't have to prevail on all of the arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Just one will be sufficient to put us all back at square one in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| As we have said many times over the past 15 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| we are not against development and we are not against apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| We believe this is just too big of a development with very little buffer between our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| the elementary school, and four- and five-story apartment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| This isn't a bad plan and this isn't a bad developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| This plan is just out of scale and inappropriate for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| Please uphold our appeal of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| There are better options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Floranoid can scale down their plan for this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| and build a development that is compatible with the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| They could effect a land swap like ORNL Credit Union did with North Shore Market Investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| and build this development on an available land in North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| that isn't subject to the scenic highway restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Or they could build their plan on a larger piece of property in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| that would allow a more appropriate scale for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| Finally, by upholding our appeal tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| you can help us all avoid the financial costs and the time it will take to see this process through the court system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| and the risk that the court will consider even one of our arguments valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| and in turn reversing everything up to this point and burden the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| with the cost of the litigations including granting us relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| including our cost expenses and attorney's fees that we have requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| Please vote for our appeal so our community, including Floranoid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| can get on with this development at an appropriate scale or location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you, Mr. Slaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Okay, Mr. Seymour, I have Arthur Seymour, Brad Salisbury, and Jeremy Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Mayor, members of council, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| I am here on behalf of Floranoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| This is part of the North Shore Town Center that we are discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| In 2004, a development plan and standards for North Shore Town Center was approved by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1523)|
| 0:25:32| and those building standards apply to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| On the property that Floranoid has before you tonight was originally proposed 180 townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| with no separation between the property line and the buildings themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| Floranoid started this process and originally planned what was to be a suburban development for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1552)|
| 0:26:01| After meetings, including Councilman Greve, who I must state has never been employed by Floranoid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1561)|
| 0:26:10| we were told very bluntly this type of development was not appropriate for the town center development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| We also consulted with the neighbors, Margaret Butler, an architect, and Judge Stevens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| and Mike Stevens and others who have homes at the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| They told us they did not like our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| After numerous revisions, meetings with Mr. Donaldson at MPC, we have considerably revised the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1590)|
| 0:26:41| and your zoning required that we comply with the design standards contained in the North Shore Town Center guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1601)|
| 0:26:51| MPC found we did. We think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| We think we comply fully with those guidelines, and MPC so approved the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| We have made changes as we have gone along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| We have increased the separation between Mr. Slagle's house and a couple of his neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| by well over 100 feet from the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| whereas the original proposal contained in these standards had zero separation from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| We would ask that you deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Let me raise with you the specific plans or objections that Mr. Slagle has raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1645)|
| 0:27:35| He says this is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| This is part of a town center zoning, a district that includes office, retail, commercial, and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1657)|
| 0:27:46| And by the way, residential is a key to the development and survival of a town center neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| and there's very little residential in there now, perhaps 25 or 30 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| What Flournoy is bringing to the table are 242 residences, whereas this plan originally envisioned over 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1679)|
| 0:28:09| We hope there can be some more residences in there, but that is the key to the town center development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| He says we violate the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| The general plan provides that this area is to be a mixture of commercial, retail, office, and housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1699)|
| 0:28:30| and that's exactly the component, the latter component, that Flournoy is bringing to the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| He argues the Scenic Highway Act, but he misconstrues the Scenic Highway Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| We have studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| MPC has studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| I have discussed it with your council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Town center developments or any similar zoning category are exempt from the height restrictions of the Scenic Highway Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1729)|
| 0:28:59| It's as clear as it can be in the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| That is anywhere along North Shore Drive from the city of Knoxville to or from the cemetery at Westland and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1743)|
| 0:29:13| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| To the city limits of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| So that simply is not an argument that will fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| And this amendment, by the way, was added many years ago to the Scenic Highway Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| It was not done at the behest of Flournoy or any other individual that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1771)|
| 0:29:39| So for those reasons, we respectfully submit that the arguments for an appeal do not apply here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| that Flournoy is fully compliant with the zoning ordinance, with the town center guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1787)|
| 0:29:56| and we would ask that you deny the appeal and help the North Shore Town Center flourish in a manner it was originally intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1796)|
| 0:30:08| I might add, finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| No last words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| I thought you were about to end right on the dot, and then you started another sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| It was a very brief sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| By the way, our other two speakers are here to respond to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| Mr. Salisbury is the engineer of record with Cannon and Cannon for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| And Jeremy Brewer is representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| So they don't wish to speak, but they're here to answer questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| They're here as a resource for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| So then that brings us back to Mr. Slagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| You have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Should you choose to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| The original plan was not 180 townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| It was 123 townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| I've got the drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| They're available to anybody who wants to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| The original zoning allowed up to 160 apartments, which we conceded that that would be an appropriate use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| So what we're arguing about is 86 apartments, and that's what it's always been about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| We think it's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| We think the general plan is violated in Section 11.5, which says avoid abrupt, incompatible changes in density, scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| and building appearance from one development to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| We think putting high-density residential apartments next to mature single-family homes that have been there for over 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| constitutes abrupt, incompatible changes in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| As far as the separation goes, the separation was 10 feet from our property line to their parking lot, which is the width of a parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1901)|
| 0:31:53| They have now graciously grown that to 22 feet, which we appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| I'm not being facetious about that, but that's about the length of a parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| So there's not much separation between us and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| And as far as the scenic highway goes, Mr. Seymour truncated the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1926)|
| 0:32:14| The way the statute actually reads, and I'll skip the very first part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| is now or subsequent to April 22, 2005, zone TC1 or zone TC6 from Keller Bend Road to Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1939)|
| 0:32:32| or any similar zoning category in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| We think the or similar only applies to the previous phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| It doesn't apply to all of North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Anything in Rocky Hill that's zone C6 or something similar could put a 10-story building up if that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| And we don't think that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| And we're willing to let Judge Pridemore decide that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| Okay, Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| I guess we're ready for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| We're ready for discussion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Well, my position has not changed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| I appreciate all I've heard about the developer coming back and trying to meet with some people like Mr. Grieve and Ms. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1990)|
| 0:33:19| But the reality is that we're shoehorning a lot of units onto 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| The original residential area was at least 20 or more acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| Somewhere along the way, another developer decided to invite the school system to take half that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| And now we're going to jam high-density residential right next to single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| And I realize there's a debate going on in this city or this country or broader as to whether we should stack and pack people everywhere and conserve green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2020)|
| 0:33:51| But the reality is people choose their residential area based on the surroundings and the conditions they can reasonably expect from both the zoning and the existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2031)|
| 0:34:03| And I think it's unfair that we're going to change the nature of this area, put in three- to four- or five-story buildings depending on where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| and basically pave everything that isn't inside the building except for a very small play area and the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| And in my opinion, I think it's excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I think MPC's original decision that this was probably spot zoning and should be denied should be adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| I think their change in approach and their change in position is not for the good of either zoning or the residential area that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| So I'm going to be in favor of granting the appeal, and I'll so move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Okay. Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| We have a motion and a second to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| There's the timer again. Sorry. Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| The motion fails six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you, everyone, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a lease agreement with Legacy Parks Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| to construct and maintain a water access structure south of the Gateway Pavilion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| for launching paddle boats, kayaks, canoes, and other non-motorized boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Yes. I think Carol Evans is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| She can come up and maybe tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2149)|
| 0:36:04| Carol Evans, Legacy Parks Foundation, 3505 Kesterwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| This lease is actually, and thanks to Christy for helping us work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| is really an expansion of what we did with the city about three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| by leasing the old Gateway Regional Visitor Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| and turning it into what we've called Outdoor Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| And we've seen great success there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| A small business that incubated in that building, Billy Lush Paddle Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| which is now offering kayaks, canoes, paddle boards, and added bikes a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| So we're seeing it as a great destination downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| A lot of tourists come through there, and we have a local residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| And this allows us access to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| We're currently working with Kigers Marina for boat access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| So this will allow that park that's been sitting there to become accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| We'll construct a small dock there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| They'll be able to do storage lockers down there as well because what we're discovering is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| especially people who live or work downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| it makes it very easy not to have to haul your boat or your board back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| So they'll be able to add lockers down there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| And so truly, really sort of expanding the outdoor opportunities within downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| It's very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| It is. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| All right. Thank you, Carol. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Okay. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| 11B is a resolution respectfully requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| to consider and make a recommendation to the City Council on amendments to the Zoning Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| and Building Code regarding review of the demolition of residential structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| built before 1865 and the demolition delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| I just want to hear a little bit more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| It seemed like the demolition delay for or at least the requirement for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| for houses built before the Civil War is part of a state law that we're dragging into our own code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| The 60-day delay is said to be an opportunity to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| and discuss possible preservation instead of demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| for other historic structures that are either listed or capable of being listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| And it sounds like a great idea, but if someone would speak to this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| because it's a little bit of a change in direction, but it sounds like a healthy one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| we should know more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I'm going to ask Deputy to the Mayor, Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you. Yes, Councilman, I think you characterized it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| This, A, puts state law into our code, which it's already applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| but it codifies it in our code of ordinances, protecting the pre-Civil War houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| And secondly, this does give an opportunity for there to be discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| and for alternatives to come up for demolition during a 60-day period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| rather than allowing demolition to happen extremely quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| That's basically the only change, but we think it's a very important change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| There's some precedent in the city for a discussion taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| after a demolition permit was taken out and for that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| to then be very successfully rehabilitated and be in great use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| So that is what the intent is, modeled after Nashville, where it's been very successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| and we're very hopeful and expect that it will be successful here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Not in every case, but it may in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| It's the opportunity to, it doesn't guarantee it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| but the opportunity to pursue other options is what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Exactly. There are no guarantees, but it does present a time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| by which there can be a discussion of alternatives to demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Thank you, Mayor. I think Kim Trent is in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Kim, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2378)|
| 0:39:46| Thank you, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| I'm Kim Trent, Executive Director of Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| and we fully endorse this initiative by the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| and think it's a really proactive way to look to preserve our history going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| Nashville has proven it's a useful tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and we have had situations here in Knoxville that you're all familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| where this sort of a colleague of mine in North Carolina coined a phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| called buying time for history, and this is what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| I remember that Mayor Haslam at the time gave us 45 days to save the 500 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| He ended up giving us a little more time after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Finbar, you were intimately involved in that whole negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| but that 45 days made all the difference in saving a block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| that is now one of the most vibrant and economically productive parts of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| We also bought time with the Walker Sherrill House on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| The Lomas Dow House was also slated for demolition on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| So it really shows if you can call that time out and look at solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| look at incentives, look at financial models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| it will often be a positive for the owner as well as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| which is ultimately what we all would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| So this is basically to refer to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| with Precision Traffic and Safety Systems in an amount not to exceed $79,400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| for the purchase of 40 traffic controller units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Yeah, Jim Hagerman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Jim, tell us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| I'm hopeful that we are on the way to better controlling the traffic lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| so that when you go down a major boulevard or artery that you don't stop every 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| and there can be time so that buses and cars can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| if they're moving at the proper legal speed, can actually make some progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| save a little gas, save a little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| We're not quite there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| But this is like a first step, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Or am I reading this one wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| We're just changing out automatic controllers that aren't synchronized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| Yes and no to all of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I'll break that out a little bit closer so that we can figure out what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| We are starting the process of upgrading the hardware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| so that the synchronization process can work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| But at the same time, there is some synchronization out there, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| And our engineering staff really does a lot of work in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| So I've got to give them a little credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| It's not a simple thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| I mean, if we had just one-way streets that didn't have any intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| then it would be easy to synchronize things so that you could keep going at the same speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| But because there's two-way traffic and intersections, it gets complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| and you have to make a lot of operational compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| I guess in the future you'll have more computer control too beyond this particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| Our old equipment is really old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| Our software is actually the highest level that they can all run is DOS-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| Remember DOS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| The pretty green screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| And so it's old stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| This is a start to upgrading that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| There's going to be a bigger project coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| We just got a, well, you'll probably see it on the next council agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| contract with TDOT to start the bigger systematic look at the strategic look at the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2614)|
| 0:43:45| so that we look at things like communications between the different systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| which we lack right now, communications back to a central point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| so that you can, sitting in the office or even on the laptop you take home with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| you can get a message that says something's broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| And sometimes you can reset it, but more often you'll have a better idea of what's wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| rather than go out there and make a call to try to figure out what's wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| and then go back to the shop and get the equipment to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| So it not only long term will make the traffic system work better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| but it will also be easier and cheaper to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| So we're replacing old stuff, but it will work well with the new stuff we're contemplating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| This is an early down payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| This gets about 10% of the controllers in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| So you're going to keep seeing these little contracts coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| but we're also going to be putting some of these on the bigger TDOT sponsored project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Yes, Jim, what kind of time frame are you looking at if this is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| to get the first party up and running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| It depends on just how fast it goes through the paperwork internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| but as soon as we can, I mean, probably within the next six weeks we'll have them in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| and we'll be putting them out there as soon as we have them in our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| because there is a real need for some of these to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| And how do you decide on where they're going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| Is it based on the most heavily trafficked areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| How's that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| I'm not that familiar with the day-to-day operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| This is really technical, on-the-street kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| There's a crew that spends all their time thinking about this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| but some of the criteria that they probably use for replacement is age of the existing stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2750)|
| 0:45:59| that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Some of it is really kind of held together with duct tape and it barely works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| So to an extent it's going to be replacing stuff as it breaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| but there's also some areas that are priority areas for improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2772)|
| 0:46:22| There's some corridors that are currently getting consultants working on the synchronization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2782)|
| 0:46:33| and in some cases the synchronization ability is limited by the equipment that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| and so some of these will go into those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| I see Mr. Seabrook, do you have something to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| You're with Precision Traffic and Safety Systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Yeah, if I could just add a little color to what Jim was mentioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| Eric Seabrook, President of Precision Traffic and Safety here in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| 672 Brochard Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| The question answered before is unequivocally yes to the improvement of the traffic controllers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| Just to give everybody a little perspective, as Jim mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| this is about 10% of the traffic controllers currently in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| To date, roughly 80% of the controllers you guys have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| the manufacturer of that device went out of business roughly 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| I would ask you to think of any electronics that you own that are older than 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| The traffic controllers were actually bought 20 years before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| Did Thomas Edison make these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| So, I mean, yes, as Jim mentioned, you are dealing with even pre-DOS type equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| so I would say congratulations that you guys, the council putting this to a vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| is really going to hopefully start a huge momentum in getting the traffic controllers up to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| getting the timing in place, because there are things such as clock drift, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| that all have to do with a lot of this coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| The newer controllers will be able to really enhance that and then take it to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| So, I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Council, did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you, Mr. Seabrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| I'll see you at the Medal of Honors this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Next weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=2914)|

| 0:50:21| Christy, yeah, this looks like a very healthy thing to do as we move forward on our older building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| to find out whether we can fix it, add to it, replace it, what's appropriate, what the market is telling us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| and we're getting a consultant to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I'd like to hear a little bit more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3038)|

| 0:50:44| I think we really do want to do exactly what you said, is just study what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| Look at, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| I guess I'm off now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3052)|

| 0:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| To really study what we have, first of all, to see what we can accommodate, to study what we can do structurally in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| We have issues with losing business because we're not able to support the roof structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| not able to support what's needed for different kinds of shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| And then to look at the future and study the feasibility of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| what we need in the way of a venue that is the right size for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| and be able to offer the right kind of venue for the different kinds of shows, events, performances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| that we have the opportunity to book in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3096)|

| 0:51:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Just to follow up on that, we, a few weeks ago, approved for Urban Land Institute to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| and look at the Coliseum as a piece of the five properties that they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| How does it differ from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| And what different results do you expect to get out of this group as opposed to ULI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| I think this particular study is going to focus just on the convention center auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| ULI is more, it's a broader scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| It's more looking at the site and how that particular site fits in with the fabric of the rest of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| This particular study is going to be looking specifically at this facility to determine, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| what its highest and best use is and what needs to happen to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| I think it's definitely the right move for us to consider as we consider other improvements there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| lagging, deferred maintenance that's there and needs to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| It's a great site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| It's a big site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| We're going to get done with it, and I applaud you all for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| And once we find the information, you know, we get the information together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| we'll make sure we share that with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3160)|

| 0:53:30| Councilman Delivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Yeah, I might ask Jim a quick question, Jim Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| That is, this sounds like a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| What happens when the paint starts fading and there's a debate about whether it was a yellow curb or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| Are we going to take that into account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| If we're going to do away with signs that say no parking and give you a ticket if you park there, I guess we have to be vigilant about keeping the striping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| We need to repaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3232)|

| 0:53:56| We'll repaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3236)|

| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| This is an issue that has provoked a lot of controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3271)|

| 0:55:02| As a former Boy Scout, it's my pleasure to represent the Tenassi Girl Scout Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| You've been chasing them for years, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| In connection with their property on Merchant Drive, this is a unique piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| We have had discussions with the representatives of the Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| They had a meeting with the Girl Scouts last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| I was not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| But the consensus seemed to be that everybody would like to refer this or for council to refer this back to the MPC for further discussion there about use of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3332)|
| 0:55:46| which is a fairly large boundary of property in the central part of the city and what its future will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3346)|
| 0:55:55| They discussed a number of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| There will be further discussions, and I think it would be best for all concerned if it could be referred back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3358)|
| 0:56:06| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| Yeah, I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| I'll make that motion to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| So we know we're sending it back to MPC for further discussion on the use of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| And that's appropriate, Mr. Lauter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| Any other discussion from you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| I'll just explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| What goes back to MPC for further discussion of use of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| Explain more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| I'm not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| I just don't understand why we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Well, there are several new ideas about how to use this property other than what this ordinance proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| What this is doing is buying time to look at those other options to see if they're viable or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| and if they are, then we'll have something new coming from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| If they're not, I assume we will get this back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| But there has been discussion, not conclusions about how to use the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| but there's a general understanding that some uses of that property are better than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| So this would buy time with MPC to look at this for the Tenacity Girl Scouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| the Norwood Neighborhood Group, to all have some better discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Is that pretty much true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| The property has serious site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| It has very steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| It has rock that is very obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| Part of the property is probably not usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| There were some discussions about uses that could be made of the portion that are really not, I say not usable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3460)|
| 0:57:48| they're not buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| And there were some ideas floated around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| Again, I was not present at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| I don't know whether Councilman Kampen was or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| but there seemed to be a good discussion between Mr. Redman and his neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| and the executives with the Tenacity Girl Scout Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| Councilman Dallagopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Yes, that sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| It's not going back just to see whether RP1 is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| but to discuss the ultimate land use there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| and see if they can work that out with both the zoning and the approach that's being taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| In other words, you're going to have more collaboration on the ultimate use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| I think that's the intent, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| You're not just sending it back and saying, is RP1 appropriate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| You're looking harder at the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Again, I wasn't at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| but there was a pretty broad-ranging discussion of what uses would be appropriate for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Okay, we have a motion and a second to refer back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| We are now to public forum, and we have three people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| The first is Ms. Vivian Scheip, followed by Mary Wilson and then Mary Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3543)|
| 0:59:21| Hello, Ms. Scheip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| You know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| I'll set this up for five minutes, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Vivian Scheip, 109 South Gallagher View, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| Now the word says to everything there is a season, specifically a time to be silent and a time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3574)|
| 0:59:45| Tonight we come to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| We are the voices of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| We represent the individual, the churches, the businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| and the organizations that sent you into these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| We sent you here to represent us, and you're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| You're known nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| You really have been good stewards for this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| and I say that because I don't want you to think that we've come to attack you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| What we've done is we've come to give you permission to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| Now you already, in your plan to address homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| have addressed the problem of the mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| because that is the only thing that we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Our focus is we want an alternative to jail for the mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| specifically a safety center for Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| The very bottom of your plan for 2014 says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Knoxvillians have always stepped forward to offer assistance to those in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| both in small and in significant ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| We have always done so because that is simply what a great community does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| Whatever the problem, when someone is in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| someone else in this community will step forward to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| That's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| We are here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| We elected you to come and do due diligence, to be good stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| We've come to say it is time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| It is time for a safety center as an alternative for jail for the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| That is our mission. That is our focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| It's already in your plan to address the homelessness, in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| Goal number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| You state under 4.3.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| the goal is to provide targeted assistance to address the specialized needs of a special population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| 4.3.5 specifically says persons who are mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| So we're already on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| We already have the same vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| So we are asking you to act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| Are we asking you to bear the brunt of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| That would not be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| But we are asking you to come to the table with the city, with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| with the sheriff's department, with the DAs, with the police, with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| and let's sit down specifically and talk about how we get this program going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| That's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Matthew 25.40 says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| We, the king, shall say, truly I say to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| insofar as you did for the least of these, you did for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| And don't say that we don't acknowledge the Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| because we start out with a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| We don't take off the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| We get upset when we say, and God, we trust must be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| because that means you acknowledge there is a higher power than you who are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| And that's what we're asking you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| is to acknowledge those people that he put you down here for to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Because remember, as we said before, when you die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| he's not going to ask you about your parks and your bikes and trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| He's not going to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| He's going to ask you, did you help the least of my people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Did you clothe the naked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| Did you help the poor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| That includes that little bitty subset that everybody's forgetting about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| of the homeless, and that is the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Now, we are asking you, we heard you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| We heard you when you said, is it viable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| We heard you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Do you have support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| So these thousand names that we brought you don't just represent a thousand people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| They represent tens of thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| You have people in here from nonprofit organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| that canceled their meetings to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| They represent the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| So we are asking you, specifically, set a date and bring everybody to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| It's viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| They're doing it in San Antonio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| They've been doing it for 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| They're saving $10 million a year annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| When I prayed about this, I said, Lord, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| He said, tell them I sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| I said, who sent you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| He said, I am sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| And believe me, if you're going to get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| you've got to remember he who sent you to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you, Ms. Schott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| Mary Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Hello, Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| I'll get your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| My name is Mary Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| I live at 5208 Cayuga Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| And I'm here, basically, I had been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| I have an education of two degrees with social work and mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| in addition to what I do publicly for different folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| And I'm here, really, to just speak for those who have no voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| in support of Vivian and the other folks who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| And in terms of information gathering about this particular subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| last week I attended a meeting at the Bearden Library put on by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| Tennessee Department of Mental Health, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| I don't know the acronym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| And the Sub-Department of Drug and Rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| And the meeting involved asking and inviting clients, their therapists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| clinical directors, and the officers at that department in Nashville to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| conduct open, relaxed, unofficial survey discussions with all these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3928)|
| 1:05:36| and ask them what their needs are and what the department could learn to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3936)|
| 1:05:45| provide that they need now, what they would really like to happen in their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| And they had several different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| But the one from those who lived in this immediate area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| and there were some from Blount County and others, was a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| And so I wrote that down not knowing I was going to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| but it just was appropriate to mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| And I have personal knowledge because one of my family members has gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| the system, the process, and it would have been so very helpful had he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3980)|
| 1:06:28| access to a safety center where his issues would have been addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| not criminally but as a separate entity where he would have gotten counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| And so I'm just here as an advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| I've met several other folks who have been in similar situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| and it just sounds like working on this safety center would be something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| would almost immediately show these folks that the city, county, supports their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4017)|
| 1:07:06| and want to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Thanks so much for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| Thank you, Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| And now Mary Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Thank you for being here, Ms. Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| Mary Russell, 6334 Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| From 2007 until 2013, I fought Knox County government over a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4045)|
| 1:07:35| that is called Spradlin Place Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| Spradlin Place Subdivision is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| I am in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| We are next-door neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Part of the agreement for Spradlin Place Subdivision to be built was that a turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| was to be placed, and the money was to be put aside with the city Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4069)|
| 1:07:57| That money was supposedly put aside, as was the $5 million for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| When R&R Development filed for bankruptcy, the money seemed to have turned back over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| when I called the Department of Engineering and wanted to know if they had also given back the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4089)|
| 1:08:17| I got hung up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| To make a story short and sweet, Knox County government and the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| ended up paying to fix the problem that R&R Development created on the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| That was on July 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| On July 3, we get a letter telling us about a piece of property that we bought for our grandchildren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| that is overgrown by 12 inches because the edge of the driveway, which comes up from a drain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4123)|
| 1:08:56| had not been weeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| So I sent a letter telling them and was told that they didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| I sent a copy to your office as well, and probably you didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| I sent an official letter wanting to know, number one, your 10 days is supposed to be 10 business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4149)|
| 1:09:18| I would correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| And I wanted to know about all the code violations that had not been enforced by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| Specifically, those code violations, number one, is the turn lane into Spratton Place subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4169)|
| 1:09:37| The whole subdivision is built, the whole subdivision is without being in code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| and the city of Knoxville Department of Engineering is responsible for seeing that that turn lane was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| That's out of code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Then when I asked the gentleman who was responsible for filing all the other ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4189)|
| 1:09:56| against different companies, divisions, housing, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| I was told that different divisions of the city Department of Codes handled every different department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| So I asked, what happens when someone blocks a fire hydrant to keep it from being opened to use in case of a fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4207)|
| 1:10:19| Well, that's the city fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Since the city fire department is the part of the city that is blocking all these fire hydrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4221)|
| 1:10:31| from Pleasant Ridge School to 6334 Pleasant Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| who's going to write them a piece of paper stating that they have to get theirs cleaned up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| since it's over three feet tall and covering every one of the fire hydrants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| You owe that much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| There is a drain that runs from the Spratton Place subdivision over to the side of the road on Pleasant Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4254)|
| 1:11:06| that backed up onto our property, ruined the property, which is the reason it was fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| The city of Knoxville was supposed to have cleaned out the drain 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| So that's 20 years of being without compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| No code, no letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| So I want to know, when is the city going to start writing violation letters to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| And when are they going to start putting the money into the fund for the people of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| And you could use it for a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| It's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| So who's going to take care of the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| Ma'am, this isn't a question and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| You may state your opinion, and then when we're finished, we'd be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| And if you would like to talk to any of us after the meeting, we'd be glad to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Okay, council, that completes our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| That concludes our meeting, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140902?start=4325)|
