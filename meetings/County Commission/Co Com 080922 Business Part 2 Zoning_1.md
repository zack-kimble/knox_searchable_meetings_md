| 1:22:22| There is nothing that prevents us from coming back here a month or two months from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| with five zoning districts that are spread up and down, tipped and stationed anywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| and saying we want to put all of these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Now what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| If we've already approved this one, you won't have any choice, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| but to vote right along again to increase it to where he can put 300 development units on that 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| That's the danger we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Commissioner Hammond, did you want to respond to something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| I just want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| Mr. Ballard and Mr. Brown have put out all kinds of different red herrings about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4978)|
| 1:23:06| This is a subdivision developed exactly like the South Doyle homeowners said they wanted done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| when they were opposing the medium-density residential when it was approved by MPC on two separate occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4993)|
| 1:23:22| And MPC also voted to change the sector plan on two separate occasions by an overwhelming majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| to allow medium-density residential on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| At that time, the South Doyle homeowners said they wanted two-story buildings along John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| they wanted the area to be developed as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| and that we should concentrate traffic out onto John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| At all times, I have shown a plan which has access to John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| There's a commercial component in every drawing I've ever given to anybody in South Doyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| showing what might be able to be done in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| We have addressed the traffic issues to develop this property exactly as was asked by South Doyle at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5039)|
| 1:24:07| The way that we've gone about doing it limits the ability of people to build on Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| Instead of having 31 new properties on Tipton Station Road, all with access out to Tipton Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5054)|
| 1:24:26| you've got a large 11 by 17 which shows the 145 houses that are permitted on this property under a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5066)|
| 1:24:35| showing multiple streets, multiple access points, a connection from Tipton Station to John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5075)|
| 1:24:43| which was specifically requested not to be done by the South Doyle homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| We have put forward a plan that has no connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| We show a smaller commercial component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| We show the traffic signal, which we believe we'll be able to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| We show the clustered development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| And Mr. Ballard has spoken that this is not about smart growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| He's made the comment that it's not about stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| And I want to say that I am 180 degrees opposed to those statements because this is about smart growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5107)|
| 1:25:15| This is about going and doing what I have been asked to do over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| in 30 years of coming to county commission meetings and MPC meetings, go to the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| talk to the neighbors and the neighborhood, gather their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5124)|
| 1:25:38| When we were approved for medium density residential and we came to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| it was Mr. Brown who said he wanted the area developed as low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| They didn't want more properties to be developed medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| And so now we have controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| We have everybody to join a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| We've done everything that we've been asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| I can assure you everybody that's been in the neighborhood, as Mr. Brown said, for 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| nobody, none of them have an opposition to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| And if I may, I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| May I, Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| Would you mind to speak for just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| This is Dave Becker, who you have a letter from him from back in December when he was one of those rare voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| that stood up to the South Dwell homeowners to say that he was for the apartment development at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| And Mr. Becker has been nice enough to come in on short notice to speak one more time about this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| If you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Dave Becker, 817 Villa View Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5200)|
| 1:26:49| I attended the meeting that was held back in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| and I saw the presentation that was given for the apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| at which time I thought that this was a good thing for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| I live basically about a half a mile west at Wildwood Villas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| where I've been president of the homeowners association there for the past four and a half to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| I've been in the community with my wife for over ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| and I'm in an area where we have 81 units on nine and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| And as far as the legalities and so forth of this are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| I realize that these are details that have to be worked out for the future concerns of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| One of the things that attracted my wife and I to the community was the South Doyles Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| I'm a firm believer in community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| I think it's important to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| and I also think that it's important to watch projects that are being done within the community to safeguard everyone that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5265)|
| 1:27:53| When a responsible developer like Victor comes into the area to do a project, and he's local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5273)|
| 1:28:01| This is a man that wants to invest his community in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| and we have tremendous growth in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| The Walmart, the Home Depot, the Lowe's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| all these things that have been developed out there are causing the need for a project such as his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| Consequently, we have someone here now that has tried to get everything that he can possibly do in order to be able to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5300)|
| 1:28:30| and because of minor points along the way, he is being delayed and delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5310)|
| 1:28:39| I have seen him delayed at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| It was postponed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| I mean, excuse me, last December, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| This was postponed last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| Have you had a chance to look at the letter that I wrote that was passed around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| That pretty well speaks volumes for how I still feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| Originally, I still think the apartment idea is better, but this is second to being as good possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5341)|
| 1:29:12| A lot of people in the area have parents that are going to look for pieces of property to live like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| that they want to be out of their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| We have people moving into the area because it's developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| and they need a good place to live at an affordable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5365)|
| 1:29:33| Another reason I'm here today is because I just met, you know, I don't even know Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5373)|
| 1:29:40| For the record, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| But what I do feel is I don't feel as though he's being given a fair shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| at anybody else coming up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| And I am in favor of this because I think it's a fair and reasonable project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| and I think it's good for the community, and I think it's good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| Mr. Chairman, I had a sidebar with our law director asking him some legal questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| and as we finished, I asked him if he would share this with the rest of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| because I thought it would be appropriate for you to hear what he had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| So, Mr. Lockett, we were talking specifically about the agreements that Mr. Jernigan might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| with the property owners in the back of his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| the whole notion of transfer of development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| and could you share with them what you had told me about any concerns you might have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| Well, it's not so much that I have concerns about the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| It's the fact that we have a proposal that, as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5433)|
| 1:30:40| includes those agreements as being part of the overall plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| and yet this body does not have those agreements before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| So if, on a going-forward basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| approval tonight is somehow based upon what is in those agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| it would seem that it would be well that we have those agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| The gentlemen from MPC have already stated that this has been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5470)|
| 1:31:20| So be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| If this is a purely zoning issue, then obviously this body can vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5482)|
| 1:31:30| But in terms of including property owners who own adjacent tracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5490)|
| 1:31:39| and we're talking about including it in a subdivision plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| and there was a mention that there was precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| I believe you mentioned Turkey Creek and Brandywine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Is it the same in terms of there being a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| and the adjoining tracts that you mentioned that were combined into one district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| Did MPC have agreements to review or were the properties combined so that ownership was in one entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5526)|
| 1:32:15| I mean, to me, this seems like it's a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| And as Mr. Ballard mentioned, there's not a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| even though state law allows transfer of development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| and it's been stated here tonight that this is not a transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| It does possess some characteristics of a transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| Now, that's why I mentioned that it was a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| The way it's been discussed earlier tonight was that it's zoning and nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| And if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| then there are questions raised based on the presentations made earlier tonight about other agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| and those agreements forming the basis for what is going to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5582)|
| 1:33:09| And that's why I pointed out to Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| that it might be well that those agreements be before the body so that they can be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| If I could just address that particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| The issue that Mr. Donaldson brought up about Brandywine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| Could I just ask you one real quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| Where is Turkey Creek and Brandywine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| On Campbell Station Road, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| It's on Campbell Station Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| It's just north of I-40, I-75, west of Campbell Station Road, top of Fritz Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5621)|
| 1:33:51| And that's county only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| It's not Farragut or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| It's county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| It's within a little notch of the county that Farragut existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| And so the issue about bringing the properties forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| If you'll notice on the zoning map that's handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| there is no break in the property for the zoning property owners, different property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| It's all showing as one to five units an acre because there's no recognition of it's been done so long in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5658)|
| 1:34:26| to combine zoning districts that are side by side that have the same density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| The issues of the other documentation, the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| the subdivision plat sets forward all the guidelines that need to be done to limit how these properties are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| And, again, it's like we've moved forward to create large lots for these individual property owners in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5683)|
| 1:34:53| But the specific issue is that I have offered all of the additional stipulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| because I thought they would be fair and reasonable things to begin to put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| because I do recognize that I'm the first person who's had to come back up in front of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| to combine zoning districts like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| So I offered to the homeowners association a series of restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| which I have seen enforced all over the city of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| and appeared not to ever be able to be overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| I have offered to implement and provide the stipulations that they're asking for because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5727)|
| 1:35:38| this is nothing but a subdivision that everybody's joining into for their own good and their own benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5738)|
| 1:35:47| Can I ask you a question here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| We've got these two maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| Which one of these two are you proposing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| The cluster development in your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| This one right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| So what's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| That's what the property is currently zoned to permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| And that is a development plan that could be put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| For example, I currently own and control a 50-foot right-of-way from Tipton Station Road to John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5766)|
| 1:36:18| And you can see where that road is on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| So if you weren't able to do this, you would do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| No, I'm not saying that I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| I'm saying that somebody could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| And it's approved for that development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| That is the typical development plan that somebody would put forward on 144 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| And that is the reason exactly that I say that I am 180 degrees opposed to what Mr. Ballard is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| We are trying to utilize all of those things which everybody talks about in smart growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| Cluster development, storm water, better storm water controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| creating open space in park areas, creating a walking trail to connect the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| to make sure that we have traffic controls in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| Assuming that we get the units structured as we do with the entrance on John Sevier the way it's shown with the cluster development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5821)|
| 1:37:09| we have a traffic study from Wilbur Smith that says that we will be entitled to receive a traffic signal if we so choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| based on the fact that we'll have a 1.2 acre, 1.3 acre commercial component that will go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| All facing John Sevier, all part of a future plan if it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| None of that is to be approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| But it's a fact that we try to keep people informed way in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| now for more than a year and a half working with the South Doole homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| to bring forward the plans exactly as they have asked for them to be brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| We have just a motion on the floor now, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| I think originally I had a motion with Commissioner Luthold second that we would defer this one and set up a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5875)|
| 1:38:06| Quite frankly, I think we need to sever those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| I think we need to vote on the committee later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| We need to vote on this thing up or down because this is about a rather controversial subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| These neighbors have organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| I think currently they're being disrespected by a roundabout route of trying to negate what this commission has already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| So we probably need to vote on this separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| That's sort of what I was trying to allude to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| At the second degrees, we need to get back to a situation where we vote on this one straight up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| followed by a vote on your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| And my apologies for merging them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| I thought that might have worked better, but I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| I tell you, that's exactly what I was going to bring up is that I thought what we ought to do is we ought to vote on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| I think your idea and Commissioner Luthold's idea of having a workshop or whatever we want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| a task force to decide what we want to do on these transfer of rights or developmental rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| or whatever you want to call it is a separate issue, and that's what I was questioning early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| Did you oppose the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Are you opposing the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| And the answer that I understood was there was an opposition to the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| because there was concern that that was setting a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| I think there was opposition to both, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Well, there may be, but what I would like to do is exactly what you proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| I was going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Let's vote on this project either up or down to let it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Have you withdrawn your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Because I'll agree to withdraw the second, and then we can go back to do whatever we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| I think that's exactly what should happen, and that's what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| Then I'll make a motion when it's appropriate on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the project, and then we can vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| I'll second it so we can vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| Mr. Chairman, I'll hand it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| Well, we still have quite a few lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| I think Commissioner Bray was done, and Commissioner Lambert would be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| Here's what I'm curious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| Parcel number 22.03, that's not owned by Mr. Jernigan at this moment, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6012)|
| 1:40:22| Combining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Is parcel 22.03 owned by you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| Parcel 23.01, is that owned by you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| Here's what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| What is the difference in those two pieces of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Because we see situations like combining 31 and 22.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6041)|
| 1:40:49| We see that every single month up here with, you know, nothing being said about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| But now when we propose putting 31 and 23.01 into the same subdivision district, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6056)|
| 1:41:06| people are raising cane about it and calling it transferable development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| I mean, I've read a little bit about transferable development rights on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| It appears that it's when you have properties that aren't anywhere near each other that you transfer the development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6075)|
| 1:41:24| And it looks like a good idea in some situations to preserve some screen space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| But this looks to me like what we do every single month when we combine, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| parcel 31 and 22.03 into a subdivision district and have a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6095)|
| 1:41:43| We do that every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| So I would argue that the precedent has already been set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| and that there is no difference in combining these properties up here at the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| and these properties here at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| It looks to me like it's exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| And I guess what I'm wondering is, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| if you've got two pieces of property and they're both zoned with the same zoning on five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6126)|
| 1:42:14| Can you clarify your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| Because one of the properties is zoned and the other one is simply renting some quality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| If I have two pieces of property, one is zoned five units per acre, one is zoned five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6140)|
| 1:42:28| I combine those two and I have a subdivision of a density of five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| Does the Knox County Commission have to approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Or can they just go to MPC and take the subdivision where the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| where the density is not changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| or can they just combine that without the approval of the Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6164)|
| 1:42:50| Can who approve what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| If I take two pieces of property, both of them zoned with the same density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| and I combine them together and form a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| Same owner, same ownership, or different ownerships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Well, none of these subdivisions have same ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| They always have different ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| The one you're talking about coming up here every month has the same ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| No, they do not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| And I've been here a few more months than you, but they never have the same ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| The ownership is not transferred until after the zoning is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6201)|
| 1:43:28| Commissioner, in response to your question, you said the ownership is never transferred until the zoning is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| Until the zoning is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| But I'm saying if the zoning was in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| That's why I raised the question earlier about what are the agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| Well, that's what I'm saying here is do we have to hear if I've got an option on my neighbor's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:55| mine is zoned five units per acre, theirs is zoned five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| I've got an option on their property, I'm going to combine them together and build a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| because I don't recall us approving a subdivision, planned residential, where the zoning didn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6245)|
| 1:44:14| And so that's what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Is it just that I haven't seen one where the zoning density didn't change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6255)|
| 1:44:24| Is this the first one where the zoning density didn't change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| Or have I just overlooked something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| Do we have to approve two planned residential subdivisions coming together when there's no change in density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6271)|
| 1:44:39| There's a difference in whether you have an option on the property to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| or whether you're just buying the rights from somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| I can't see that there's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| If I understand correctly, the reason that we're here tonight is because of combining the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| But what I'm wondering is, is do we even need to make this decision tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| Because I would think where the density is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| I'm just wondering whether he could combine the districts together without Knox County Commission approving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6306)|
| 1:45:15| because I don't ever recall us approving them when the density stayed the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| And I don't see a density change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| I can speak to that, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| The past practice of the Planning Commission has been to treat side-by-side districts with the same density as a single district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6325)|
| 1:45:33| and you have never seen those come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| We changed our policy with this one because we started envisioning scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6336)|
| 1:45:42| where you might have side-by-side districts with a ridge separating them, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| and density moving across the ridge or across the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| So we wanted to have this discussion at the zoning stage rather than as an appeal of a development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6352)|
| 1:46:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Well, I mean, here's my problem, and I'm planning to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| Parcel 31.01, when this was originally done, that was all combined in one zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6368)|
| 1:46:17| yet 31.01 never changed ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| I can't see the difference in what happened when this was originally divided up and zoned five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6383)|
| 1:46:31| and what's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| I just, for the life of me, can't see the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| It's just that, you know, some folks have brought this confusing concept of transferable development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| which is a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Transferable development rights in a lot of areas has preserved wetlands, has preserved green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6407)|
| 1:46:54| and I don't see how it became such a dirty word, especially when this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| This is what we do every month, combining properties into one zoning district with one zoning density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6420)|
| 1:47:09| and I just can't see the difference between this and what's been done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| and I can't see what all the fuss is about except, you know, somebody doesn't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6435)|
| 1:47:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Mr. Jernigan, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| I look around the room and our commissioners, and I count eight commissioners that are relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| You have been dealing with this for how long, and how many times have you been up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| and how many times have you been to MPC on this one project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| This is the fifth time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| I've been six times to MPC and five times to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| What would you care to share with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| I'm sorry, this is the fourth time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| I don't think this is relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| What would you care to share, if any, that you have already invested in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| What's it costing you monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Because we're looking at making delays and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| and I want to let these people know how much time you've spent in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| and how much another month means to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| Well, as a normal course of business, we never speak about what something costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6501)|
| 1:48:27| or whether profits are a reason to get a zoning or not a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| The people that have seen me come up over the years have understood that what we believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| are smart growth practices that are really on the cutting edge of what may be done in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| but are old school in some of the most beautiful places in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| The amount of money that we have spent in this project is, I mean, it is, as I said at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6526)|
| 1:48:54| there's more than two commas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| There are two commas and soon to be more than two digits, it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| But it winds up that we're in a situation where the investment is for a 30-year view into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6540)|
| 1:49:09| And if you go to the website and you look at what we say and what we try to get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| we are making investments on how they're going to look 30 years into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| And if we do something and we do it right, even if we may lose money on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| we try to weigh that over the ability to do projects again and again and again in a particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| or a particular section of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| It's the long-term goal of trying to do things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| The neighborhood has asked us to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| We have done them exactly the way the neighborhood has asked us to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| The issue that Mr. Ballard wants to continue to make and the other people want to make is that I am not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6583)|
| 1:49:51| I have said from day one I am not purchasing the properties on Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| I've never indicated because the people don't want to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| Mr. King, just two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| Mr. King would like to make a point about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| Two quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| The capability under the current zoning ordinance for doing what is being done here has always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6609)|
| 1:50:17| And you've heard them explain why it is you have this before you for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| It's the change in policy from their standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| And Mr. Lambert is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| This gets done, this kind of thing gets done all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| But the point to Commissioner Brown was what's the benefit to these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| The people that are involved who are going to become a part of this subdivision aren't here complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| And probably among the reasons that they aren't is what benefit is it to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6642)|
| 1:50:48| They are now in a subdivision that has a pool, a clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| They now have the capability for connecting on to sewer if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| And it is a way for them to realize value out of their homes without them having to sell it and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6656)|
| 1:51:06| We're going to pay you, sir, an amount that says that you're going to put your property in this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6666)|
| 1:51:13| and you're going to be subject to restrictions as to the number of units that will be permitted on the entirety of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6673)|
| 1:51:19| In exchange for that, we're going to give you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| And you don't have to sell your house to get that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| You don't have to do anything to get that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| You can continue to live there, as you say, for the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| Now, the last point was what happens if Grandma or Grandpa die and a child comes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6690)|
| 1:51:38| or a grandchild comes along and they want to sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| It's the same issue in every subdivision in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| They're all subject to subdivision plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| They're all subject to, if they want to be, certain deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| And if their grandmother's house was in an area that has already reached its maximum number of permitted units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6715)|
| 1:52:04| they're not going to be permitted without a lot of trouble and without a lot of agony and this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| They're not going to be permitted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| I'm going to change and we're going to do something else and I'm going to get more units, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| It's the same in every other subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| It will be the same here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| Mr. King, we need your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| That's John King, PO Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| Mr. Ballard has another comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| Were you finished, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| No, I was not finished at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| This is to our MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| And no disrespect whatsoever to the neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| but when I look at MPC staff and I read their recommendations, they're the professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| they're the ones that have the degrees, and then they have a commission board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| They said to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| Mark, you all still think this is a good project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| The Planning Commission recommended its approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| and I would just remind folks that this is the first step in a multi-step process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6785)|
| 1:53:12| ultimately leading towards a recordable final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| The zoning requires two steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| The development plan is the second step once this zone district is created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| That triggers a three-step process through the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| by which time we will have a recordable plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| And as Mr. Jernigan has indicated, a set of deed restrictions that will be recorded along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6814)|
| 1:53:40| And this is what I go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| You guys are the professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| I know neighborhood associations want different things and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| I don't think even your neighborhood association has the degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| and has the planning experience as what our MPC, and that's what we rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| So that's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Now, I think, can I ask the homeowners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| which one of these developments did you actually prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| Neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Okay, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| I've got to make sure that's clear, and I would love the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| and I'm not going to do it to your time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| I would love the opportunity to rebut many of the things that have been said for the last 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| But to answer your question, the one you've got that shows a whole lot of houses there, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| This is for the apartments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| That's showing five dwelling units per acre on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| That's extremely misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| The one that shows fewer units has twice the number of dwelling units in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6888)|
| 1:54:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| Okay, so when you talk about schools and traffic and those issues, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| As I pointed out up front, we're not here to talk about the diversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| We're, again, talking about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| Okay, so the questions I have, I think, and, Victor, I talked to you at length about this yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6905)|
| 1:55:13| Victor's right in that what he's done with this concept shows all the things that I've learned about smart growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| about clustering homes, it preserves all of this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| You know it will never be developed, so there's a good buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| You're adding the stormwater things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| And I think the problem is, and this is where I'm having a problem too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| and I asked you this yesterday when you keep saying, and you too, Mark, that we do this all the time, we do this every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| And I said, well, give me an example of something exactly like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| And you said, well, not exactly this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| This is, you're asking me to look at a cat and call it a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| I think this is definitely some sort of transfer development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| Now, that's not to say that I oppose this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| I think the concept is good, but I think where feelings are hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| and where people are getting their back up, and this goes for me too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| is that instead of just coming to us and saying, or to the homeowners association and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| I want to put this many units on and this is how I want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| and this is something new, and help me figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| You're trying to say, oh, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| It's not transfer development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| It's something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| And that makes me feel like you're not thinking that I'm intelligent enough to figure this out and figure it out with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6982)|
| 1:56:31| And I'm wondering if the homeowners are saying they don't oppose your concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| What they're opposing is the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| And so I think that we've got a glitch in how the process was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| And I understand that you all worked together at one point fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| So I'm trying to figure out where the breakdown in communication happened between you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| and the homeowners that got us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Because, like I said, I don't think the development concept is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| It's the communication and the breakdown in that that's causing the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7018)|
| 1:57:04| Let me clarify, and then I'll let you answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| That's one point I wanted to rebut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| When I said I was speaking to diversions, I did not say that this was not an example of smart growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| I said that's not what it's about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| We're talking about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| I wanted to clarify that because he said otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| So, Victor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| The situation at Brandywine is, and I was unaware, candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7048)|
| 1:57:35| I know exactly where the Brandywine development is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| but I wasn't aware that they had combined three different ownerships in the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| because it was the most recent example immediately preceding mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| So, I mean, that was done, and it's identical to what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| There's no difference between what happened at Brandywine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| But is that one person that owns it all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| No, it's three different owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| Okay, three people, and they're combining it together voluntarily, and they're all going to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7075)|
| 1:58:00| It's exactly the same as this plan right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| There's no difference between the two plans as to the way the plan was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| except that I've been brought back up to discuss the overarching zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| The situation on the creation of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| and it was the point that Greg had asked earlier about the 3201, 3202,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| I have contracts to purchase those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| I intend to purchase those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| assuming we can move forward and get the plats recorded that we're looking to try to get accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7104)|
| 1:58:30| which are shown in the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| The properties I could, through convoluted all kinds of gerrymandering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7112)|
| 1:58:41| wind up buying all the properties on Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| It would be the same net effect that Mr. Ballard has said he would be happy to support if I buy those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7124)|
| 1:58:50| Then I own those properties, and then I do the development, and I sell those people back their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| That kind of transaction would be relatively straightforward and easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7134)|
| 1:59:00| We don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| We are trying to be forward in the sense that it's a joining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| It's the same district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| These people don't want to go through all the problems and aggravations of selling the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| and then buying it back from me 90 days later, 120 days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| We're not trying to be deceptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| We're trying to be always on the forefront of providing the information to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| So it is a situation that the subdivision regulations that are currently available allow us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7163)|
| 1:59:31| and have done every month exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| Mr. Ballard, at one point did you feel like, I mean, do you feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| I kind of feel like somebody's trying to pull the wool over my eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| and that's what's making me have problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| Is that the same thing you're experiencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| We don't feel like the wool's being pulled over our eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| This property was approved for five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| We talked as an organization, did not oppose it because it met the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7199)|
| 2:00:09| Greater than five dwelling units per acre does not meet the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| What is being proposed before you today is on the order of eight and a half dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| by some other means other than rezoning to a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| Now, they're using the subdivision terminology, but that, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| if he had come in here with purchased property or two or more owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| and they had legal documents and were on record, are these people, question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| are these people part of Wells Creek development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| These people that are transferring their rights, are they owners in Wells Creek development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7242)|
| 2:00:51| Could I clarify some things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| Again, I don't want to use your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| I've already mentioned smart growth and storm water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| We did not say that there's not good things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| We said that's a diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| That's not what this is really about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| That's going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| It's covered by regulation, covered by ordinances in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| That's the whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| What's being done here isn't covered by an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| Actually, the clustering I don't believe is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=7277)|
