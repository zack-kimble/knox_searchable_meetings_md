| 2:57:17| And either you can appoint, reappoint those that are currently in the positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10637)|
| 2:57:28| and if you want to take that into your consideration, into your vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10648)|
| 2:57:32| then obviously you have that right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10652)|
| 2:57:37| I didn't set the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| This is what we have to do as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10659)|
| 2:57:42| We have to appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| Now, does that mean we automatically reappoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| Do we have to consider others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| This commission decided back in the summertime that we were going to open this up to applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| We have had a number of applicants come forward, took the time to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10675)|
| 2:58:02| and have, in some instances, taken the time to call commissioners I know I've been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10682)|
| 2:58:10| And I think that we owe it to them to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| Now, whether you want to take into consideration the experience of those that have been sitting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10695)|
| 2:58:22| I think that's a very legitimate reason for voting for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10702)|
| 2:58:27| But I think you should take into consideration the qualifications that the other applicants bring forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10707)|
| 2:58:33| This board here, this commission, can decide if we wish maybe extend it another month to get some more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10713)|
| 2:58:42| but we've already extended it six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| I think it's time to go ahead and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| But that's the pleasure of this body, and that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10727)|
| 2:58:50| We don't have a choice as to whether or not to, I think in my mind, to automatically reappoint or let them roll over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10730)|
| 2:58:59| We're charged with having to make appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| We're going through an appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| and it includes three of them that wish to continue on and a number of others that wish to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10743)|
| 2:59:15| I think I need to know the pleasure of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion to see where it goes that we extend the present commissioners for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10758)|
| 2:59:25| and that we vote on this in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| Again, that would be my preference, but, again, I'll go with the will of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10768)|
| 2:59:31| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10773)|
| 2:59:39| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10779)|
| 2:59:40| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we go ahead and hear this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10780)|
| 2:59:44| We have had many, many months to prepare for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| I'm well prepared for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| You know, I understand that we have a couple of commissioners that have not been able to prepare for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10789)|
| 2:59:57| but I think that most of us are ready to go, so that's my substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| We have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| Mackenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10808)|
| 3:00:11| I was just going to say, I have done my homework on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10811)|
| 3:00:17| I have found out what judicial commissioners do, and I have studied up on all of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10817)|
| 3:00:26| What I'm concerned about is I want to hear more from the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| and I want to hear more from the police officers about what they are looking for in a judicial commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10830)|
| 3:00:36| before we move forward and vote on any of these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10841)|
| 3:00:42| And, also, I recognize and respect that Commissioner Hammond could use a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10842)|
| 3:00:49| And, honestly, from what I saw at the meeting that we had last week, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10849)|
| 3:00:54| there's more than just one person out there who's confused on what these people do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10854)|
| 3:00:58| and why we're doing this now and what's wrong with the ones that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| So an extension of one more month isn't going to kill anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| and it might give us some time to do this in a little neater fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10867)|
| 3:01:11| Mr. Chairman, in regards to police and attorney general's office and judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| I think that we need to remind the commission that, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10876)|
| 3:01:21| Judge, these are independent offices of those entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10881)|
| 3:01:25| and so we've got to make sure that there's judicial independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10885)|
| 3:01:30| So we have to be careful in how we garner opinions from other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10890)|
| 3:01:37| because they have to remain quasi-independent of each other because they are part of the justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10897)|
| 3:01:43| but also independent of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| Is that correct, Judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10905)|
| 3:01:48| Obviously, when they're passing on requests for warrants, they have to exercise independent judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10908)|
| 3:01:57| And as to your qualities, you know, knowledge in the law, punctual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| willing to work really strange, tough hours, shift work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10921)|
| 3:02:07| have some knowledge of computers, at least enough to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10927)|
| 3:02:11| because we have computer-generated warrants now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| And these are all, they are an independent judicial officer that serves the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| that serves the whole justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| I guess one of the questions I was asking, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| was because you had asked so many questions about how could, do you have any ideas for improving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10945)|
| 3:02:34| What about if an officer disagreed with you on, you know, sending out a warrant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10954)|
| 3:02:40| I mean, that made me think that there was more going on that we needed to know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10960)|
| 3:02:45| for us to make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| Well, when an officer and a judicial commissioner can't come to terms with a warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| or the signing of a warrant, they have the opportunity to call either a DA and or a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10971)|
| 3:02:59| And then it's moved up the chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| And that has happened in several instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10982)|
| 3:03:06| But the processes that we can, when I ask them about issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10986)|
| 3:03:12| and I only ask the incumbents because they're the only ones that are down there all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10992)|
| 3:03:17| you know, there's a lot of things broken with our system in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| And I think that the people that are in those positions to think about change, improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11000)|
| 3:03:29| should be the ones that are already in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| If you have been down there so long, you get a little stale to the what makes it better topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11012)|
| 3:03:39| I mean, there are some things we can do a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| We can stop letting people bond out that are already bonded out on a previous duplicate charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11021)|
| 3:03:47| You know, we can make them see a judge before they bond out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| So, I mean, there are some things that law enforcement should see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11033)|
| 3:03:54| This is the kind of discussion that this entire body needs to have before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11034)|
| 3:04:00| This entire body was invited to that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11045)|
| 3:04:06| Amy, would it help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11046)|
| 3:04:07| We've got a judicial commissioner sitting out here that is not up for reelection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11047)|
| 3:04:11| Maybe let him come speak for maybe three minutes of what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| No, I understand exactly what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| My concern is that the rest of the commission also understand exactly what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11057)|
| 3:04:22| And like Brad was talking about issues in our system that are broken that need to be fixed, what are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11062)|
| 3:04:28| We need to talk about those, too, I think, to make sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11068)|
| 3:04:32| I mean, we did such a careful, careful job electing Michelle to sit on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11072)|
| 3:04:38| I think every one of us did an exceptionally careful job vetting everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11078)|
| 3:04:44| And we know what the issues are sitting on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11084)|
| 3:04:48| We don't always know what the issues are with judicial commissioners and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11088)|
| 3:04:54| So that's what I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11094)|
| 3:04:55| I wish that we had had more of that kind of dialogue and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11095)|
| 3:04:59| and that we had more of that kind of information before we make these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11099)|
| 3:05:05| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11107)|
| 3:05:11| You know, each of us, because of the gag order, whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11111)|
| 3:05:16| we can't discuss things amongst us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| We have to find other ways to get information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| And it's not always, it's time-consuming to have to wait a year to this meeting to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11123)|
| 3:05:29| I went out myself and talked to several of those who use these services, and that's where I made my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11129)|
| 3:05:38| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11138)|
| 3:05:39| I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11139)|
| 3:05:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| We've got a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11142)|
| 3:05:45| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| The question is to proceed with a vote on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| This is a motion to call for the question, to cut off debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11150)|
| 3:05:58| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11158)|
| 3:05:59| This is on the substitute motion, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11159)|

| 3:14:01| Brown said Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| We've got two ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11643)|
| 3:14:06| Is this a pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11646)|
| 3:14:07| I'd like to change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11650)|
| 3:14:11| Just for a procedural matter so that we'll have an easier time dropping one off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11651)|
| 3:14:16| I'm going to change my vote to Jeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| Who did you vote for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11660)|
| 3:14:21| From where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| I voted for Creekmore, and if I vote for Jeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11662)|
| 3:14:24| then that leaves us where we have several with three and then one with two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11664)|
| 3:14:29| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11669)|

| 3:14:37| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11677)|
| 3:14:46| The vote is Brown 7, Jeter 3, Rogers 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11686)|
| 3:14:52| Creekmore 3, and Stewart 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| So Stewart will drop off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| and we'll go with the four names of Brown, Jeter, Rogers, and Creekmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=11698)|

| 3:25:25| Eight, three, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12325)|
| 3:25:26| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12326)|
| 3:25:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12327)|
| 3:25:28| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12328)|
| 3:25:32| Jeter, eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12332)|

| 3:25:39| And Creekmore, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12339)|
| 3:25:42| So LaDuke and Guess will drop off and we'll have Jeter, Rogers, and Creekmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12342)|
| 3:25:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12355)|
| 3:26:00| Well, I guess a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12365)|
| 3:26:06| Did you say the votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12366)|
| 3:26:08| I thought the lowest vote getter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12368)|
| 3:26:10| We had two that had zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12370)|
| 3:26:12| So you're counting zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12372)|
| 3:26:17| In my mind, it seemed like the three would be the one that dropped south on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12377)|
| 3:26:22| I guess I asked the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| Section N of your rules say that the lowest vote getter drops off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12386)|
| 3:26:35| It doesn't say what to do in the event of a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12395)|
| 3:26:41| So actually, I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| You're saying since they didn't get a vote and that's not provided for in your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12404)|
| 3:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12412)|
| 3:26:53| I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12413)|
| 3:26:54| So actually, it's up to the pleasure of this body what it wants to do since it's not provided for in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12414)|
| 3:27:02| So, Mr. Law Director, would I be in proper order if I made a motion that we drop the person with three votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12422)|
| 3:27:12| As well as those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12432)|
| 3:27:15| I think you would be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12435)|
| 3:27:18| I'd make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| Well, I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12442)|
| 3:27:26| We're just adding rounds to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12446)|
| 3:27:28| Adds a round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12448)|
| 3:27:30| Commissioner McKenzie, are you dropping the three and the two zeros?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12453)|
| 3:27:34| That will be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| Well, I think the point of order is that the ruling of the chair was to have the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12456)|
| 3:27:43| Well, if the chair would yield to the law director's discretion there or advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12463)|
| 3:27:48| Well, the law director didn't exercise discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12468)|
| 3:27:51| Yeah, that's why I changed it to advice there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12471)|
| 3:27:54| I would suggest the way your rule reads, the way the rule of the commission reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12474)|
| 3:28:02| is that if no one is elected on a given ballot, the nominee receiving the smallest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12482)|
| 3:28:11| We could have taken the vote and been done with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12491)|
| 3:28:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| I'll rescind my motion if the second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12496)|
| 3:28:20| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12500)|

| 3:30:07| We'll start over with nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12607)|

| 3:34:36| Come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12876)|
| 3:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12884)|
| 3:34:45| Can we take a break, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12885)|
| 3:34:48| I'll second that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12888)|
| 3:34:49| Oh, we have some house cleaning to do in 803. It was just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12889)|
| 3:34:57| Either more action taken or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12897)|
| 3:35:03| Before we take a break or after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| No, let's get through with 803 right quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12905)|
| 3:35:11| We just need a motion that we receive the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12911)|
| 3:35:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12916)|
| 3:35:17| Properly moved and seconded that we did receive the report of 803. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12917)|
| 3:35:23| Opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12923)|
| 3:35:25| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12925)|
| 3:35:26| We can go ahead. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12926)|
| 3:35:28| There's one other piece of house cleaning I'd like to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12928)|
| 3:35:30| It's resolution 907 deals with the feasibility study on the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12930)|
| 3:35:35| And I know the sheriff has been here all afternoon and probably has more important things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12935)|
| 3:35:40| And he'd like to make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12940)|
| 3:35:42| And I would ask if after the break we can move that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12942)|
| 3:35:46| You want to take the break first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12946)|
| 3:35:48| I mean, we can take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12948)|
| 3:35:49| If anyone is here from pension board, I do have a question related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12949)|
| 3:35:54| We've received the report. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12954)|
| 3:35:55| But I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12955)|
| 3:35:58| Let's take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12958)|
| 3:36:01| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12963)|
| 3:36:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12964)|
| 3:36:07| We're ready for 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12967)|
| 3:36:19| I'll share mine if you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12979)|
| 3:36:26| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12986)|
| 3:36:31| Your mic's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12991)|
| 3:36:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12992)|
| 3:36:33| I was leaning the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| I don't know if anyone from retirement pension board is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12995)|
| 3:36:39| Perhaps only Ivan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=12999)|
| 3:36:41| I do want to remind them that about a year and a half, two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13001)|
| 3:36:45| this body passed a resolution requesting Knox County funds be divested when they were invested in anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13005)|
| 3:36:53| having to do with the genocide-responsible government of Sudan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13013)|
| 3:36:57| And I'm just wondering if that has been carried out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13017)|
| 3:37:00| or if a similar resolution has passed the retirement and pensions board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| Can I get any update on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| Mark, all I can do is get you the information from Kim and Bob Cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13025)|
| 3:37:09| and get it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13029)|
| 3:37:10| If you wouldn't mind, you can share that on the commission forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13030)|
| 3:37:14| I'd be fine by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13034)|
| 3:37:15| Then I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13035)|
| 3:37:16| I think also Commissioner Broyles had her light on before we adjourned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13036)|
| 3:37:19| so as a privilege I would ask that you could recognize her now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13039)|
| 3:37:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13042)|
| 3:37:24| Thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13044)|
| 3:37:25| All I wanted to say was, and I wish the rest of the commission was in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13045)|
| 3:37:29| that I know we're going to be doing this again apparently soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13049)|
| 3:37:31| this judicial commissioner appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13053)|
| 3:37:36| I think the other two appointments come up in June, the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13056)|
| 3:37:39| I would hope that we would be a little neater and tighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13059)|
| 3:37:43| and a little more transparent in our next process than we were with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13063)|
| 3:37:48| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13068)|
| 3:37:53| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13073)|
| 3:37:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13074)|
| 3:37:56| This is just kind of a detailed question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| They're probably all gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| Their term now will start, because we delayed it six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13081)|
| 3:38:05| it's going to start February, or does the term start July 1 or whenever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13085)|
| 3:38:09| No, it'll start February 1, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13089)|
| 3:38:13| If you look at the resolution that was voted on, it says February 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13093)|
| 3:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13097)|
| 3:38:18| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13098)|
| 3:38:19| is this going to mess up our attempt at staggering the terms tremendously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13099)|
| 3:38:25| Well, the resolution stated four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13105)|
| 3:38:29| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13109)|
| 3:38:30| Four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13110)|
| 3:38:31| And I believe, I don't want to get ahead of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13111)|
| 3:38:36| because I saw Commissioner Norman, the Chair of the Intergovernmental, put his light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13116)|
| 3:38:42| and I think he might be getting ready to address a subject that we discussed previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13122)|
| 3:38:51| Go ahead, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13133)|
| 3:38:54| As to Ms. Broyle's observation, that the process is a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13134)|
| 3:39:00| It's more than a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13140)|
| 3:39:02| And so we're going to talk about how to make it a bit more logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13142)|
| 3:39:07| and expeditious in terms of the judges and their participation in the front of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13147)|
| 3:39:15| instead of at the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| And so that's what I hope we'll be working on here in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13157)|
| 3:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13160)|
| 3:39:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13161)|
| 3:39:22| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13162)|
| 3:39:23| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13163)|
| 3:39:24| I believe Mr. Anders said that we couldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13164)|
| 3:39:26| the judges aren't going to recommend anybody in the police department either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13166)|
| 3:39:29| it would be unethical of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| And, you know, I don't know how we could go about it any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13171)|
| 3:39:35| This was handled exactly the same way we've handled every appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13175)|
| 3:39:38| the commissioners in every appointment, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13178)|
| 3:39:41| I feel like we've been more than above board on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13181)|
| 3:39:46| I don't know where it came out, but we take resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13186)|
| 3:39:49| we listen to the applicants just like everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13189)|
| 3:39:52| and that's the way every appointment we've ever made has been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13192)|
| 3:39:55| And if we're going to look at this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| we maybe need to look at all the other changes in the process on every appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13197)|
| 3:40:02| Well, I just respectfully disagree, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13202)|
| 3:40:05| I think the process does need to be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13205)|
| 3:40:08| and I'll offer that up as some part of a meeting here in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13208)|
| 3:40:15| We're ready to move on to 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13215)|
| 3:40:20| 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13220)|
| 3:40:21| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13221)|
| 3:40:24| to begin the feasibility study and public input on a downtime prisoner intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13224)|
| 3:40:29| including aspects of the need, location, design, size, and cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13229)|
| 3:40:34| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13234)|
| 3:40:37| No recommendation, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13237)|
| 3:40:40| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13240)|
| 3:40:43| 502 approved, so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| No, wait, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13247)|
| 3:40:48| 9-0?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13248)|
| 3:40:49| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13249)|
| 3:40:51| Oh, I'm sorry, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13251)|
| 3:40:54| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13254)|
| 3:40:56| Yes, I'd like to see if Sheriff Jones would like to come down to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13256)|
| 3:40:59| and share some information with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| And after he finishes, and if there's no questions finishing with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13261)|
| 3:41:05| I'd like to have the floor back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13265)|
| 3:41:11| Jimmy Jones, 400 Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13271)|
| 3:41:19| There's certainly been some lively debate about a downtown intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13279)|
| 3:41:23| and that's what we attempted to do from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13283)|
| 3:41:27| Some numbers have come out and made you all aware of things you haven't been aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13287)|
| 3:41:32| And I'd like to go over some of those issues right now just to make sure that you're aware of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13292)|
| 3:41:37| and what's going to happen to us in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13297)|
| 3:41:41| I don't want to be the guy to come up here and tell you I told you so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13301)|
| 3:41:44| but eight or ten months down the road we've got the possibility of being in a serious overcrowding crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13304)|
| 3:41:50| out in our East Knoxville facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13310)|
| 3:41:54| Things we've talked about were, now you all know, that on a yearly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13314)|
| 3:41:58| we spend about $1.3 million a year transporting prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13318)|
| 3:42:03| That's vehicles, gas, maintenance, and some 30 officers used to transport prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13323)|
| 3:42:11| Now, let's talk about the beds that we have out at the East Knoxville facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13331)|
| 3:42:15| We have 964 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| As of today, we had 923 prisoners out there, which means we have a surplus of 41 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13339)|
| 3:42:28| That's as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13348)|
| 3:42:30| If you'll remember, when we opened the new pod, we double-bunked some areas in the pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13350)|
| 3:42:37| which enabled us to increase that number by 96 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13357)|
| 3:42:43| So if we hadn't have double-bunked those pods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13363)|
| 3:42:46| we would be now 55 inmates above the total number of beds we have in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13366)|
| 3:42:57| Now let's talk about the downtown facility, and I'm pretty proud about what we've done down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13377)|
| 3:43:02| As most of you all know, there was a lawsuit, the Carver lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13382)|
| 3:43:06| that was filed against Knox County on January 25, 1989, some 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13386)|
| 3:43:14| and it capped the downtown jail at 215 prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13394)|
| 3:43:20| The last time we were over-capped was April 27, 2003, almost six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13400)|
| 3:43:30| During this period of time, we've also implemented an off-site booking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13410)|
| 3:43:33| which I'm proud to say has worked exceptionally well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13413)|
| 3:43:38| It's alleviating a lot of our overcrowding situation, and I was very skeptical at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13418)|
| 3:43:44| I don't care to admit it at first, but it has proven its worth, its weight's worth in gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13424)|
| 3:43:52| We've also added some alcohol and drug programs at our detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13432)|
| 3:43:56| which we help when these people go back into society, we'll help them be productive citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13436)|
| 3:44:02| and they won't be repeat offenders back in their jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13442)|
| 3:44:06| We also offer a great GED program that we're having unbelievable success with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13446)|
| 3:44:11| Chief Pete Garza is in charge of that, and he's done such a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13451)|
| 3:44:14| It's amazing how many men and women that have been able to get their GEDs through this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13454)|
| 3:44:20| Also, we offer them the ability to learn to get their driver's license test when they get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13460)|
| 3:44:27| Hopefully a lot of these people that we see don't have driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13467)|
| 3:44:30| It makes it hard for them to go out and get a job and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13470)|
| 3:44:34| So with all these programs, it's helping us with the recidivism rate of people coming back to our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13474)|
| 3:44:40| So we've done a very good job with this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13480)|
| 3:44:44| And that brings me to the next point, is with the moves we've made and the programs we've implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13484)|
| 3:44:50| it basically now, and I've learned never to say never in this job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13490)|
| 3:44:54| but basically now it makes it virtually impossible for us to ever reach the 215 number in the downtown jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13494)|
| 3:45:04| So along with the law director's help, here in the next four, six, eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13504)|
| 3:45:09| we're going to ask Judge Phillips to dismiss the 20-year-old Carver lawsuit against Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13509)|
| 3:45:16| I'm very proud to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13516)|
| 3:45:19| This lawsuit's been in effect for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13519)|
| 3:45:22| In the last six years, we've not been overcapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13522)|
| 3:45:25| We've done an excellent job with the things downtown, and we're very, very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13525)|
| 3:45:30| And we feel that we followed the rules and the regulations set down by the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13530)|
| 3:45:34| and now it's time to give us the benefit of the doubt and take us out from underneath this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13534)|
| 3:45:41| Another thing I'd like to add is that the judges and the attorney general's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13541)|
| 3:45:44| I wish they were still in here, but the judges and the attorney general's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13544)|
| 3:45:47| has been very helpful in helping us with the overcrowded problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13547)|
| 3:45:52| They have, when people serve their time in small amounts of time, they have been on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13552)|
| 3:45:58| They've been released immediately once they've paid their debt to society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13558)|
| 3:46:03| which is a tremendous help, a tremendous help in jail overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13563)|
| 3:46:09| But we also must remember that our duty as law enforcement officers are to put criminals in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13569)|
| 3:46:15| So we must keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13575)|
| 3:46:17| And if we have to stack them to the ceiling in the East Knox facility, then that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13577)|
| 3:46:23| So I'm just merely telling you that just around the corner, some of our neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13583)|
| 3:46:27| Blount County and Cocke County jails, have both been decertified just in the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13587)|
| 3:46:33| Around the corner, that's going to be knocking at our door, and we need to act instead of having to react.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13593)|
| 3:46:42| I'll take any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13602)|
| 3:46:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13605)|
| 3:46:47| I don't know that I really have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| but I would like to speak to the motion that's on the floor about our doing a feasibility study now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13609)|
| 3:46:54| if that would be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13614)|
| 3:46:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13617)|
| 3:46:58| In taking a look at the whole situation, we received a letter today from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13618)|
| 3:47:04| and I'm sure you received a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13624)|
| 3:47:06| There are a lot of very good questions that the city is asking before they agree to come on board with helping us fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13626)|
| 3:47:13| They have agreed that there's no question that there would be a lot of cost savings associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13633)|
| 3:47:18| But some of the questions that they're asking are some of the questions that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13638)|
| 3:47:21| and that is, you know, is it part of the capital plan, how is it going to work, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13641)|
| 3:47:28| But there are three or four other things, too, in looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13648)|
| 3:47:31| and in talking with some of the people who are involved that we might be able to look at as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13651)|
| 3:47:36| and I think that we need to put everything on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13656)|
| 3:47:39| First of all, it's my understanding that the court order is just on the downtown facility only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13659)|
| 3:47:43| It's not on the Maloneyville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13663)|
| 3:47:45| And please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here, because I want to make sure I get all the facts correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13665)|
| 3:47:50| And I want to commend Sheriff Jones and former Sheriff Hutchison for all the work that they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13670)|
| 3:47:54| because they have done an admirable job, an excellent job in keeping that 215 cap here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13674)|
| 3:47:59| So as we look at the Maloneyville Road, there are some things that came to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13679)|
| 3:48:04| that I think should be on the floor for discussion in addition to spending the money on the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13684)|
| 3:48:12| One of the things, for example, is taking another look at L1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13692)|
| 3:48:16| Is it possible to do some renovation there, maybe look at some additional space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13696)|
| 3:48:21| in some other county facilities such as North Central?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13701)|
| 3:48:24| Some of these may not be feasible, but I think that they need to be put on the table for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13704)|
| 3:48:28| The other program we have is in talking with Todd Cook about our bracelet program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13708)|
| 3:48:33| As of I talked with him two weeks ago before I had to go out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| he told me he only had seven people on the bracelets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13716)|
| 3:48:39| Now, of course, that's a judge's decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13719)|
| 3:48:41| but he said that they definitely have room to expand in the bracelet program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13721)|
| 3:48:44| that that's something that we could take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| And also the whole notion of perhaps putting a courtroom at the facility on Maloneyville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13727)|
| 3:48:53| And I'm told that we do not need to build a facility that you could actually put a flat top out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13733)|
| 3:48:58| and that would save in transportation costs and having to bring all of the prisoners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13738)|
| 3:49:03| And, again, we would need to get the judiciary involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| but I think that's something that needs to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13745)|
| 3:49:07| I mean, these are all things that need to be put on the table for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| The other thing is with regards to the arrests on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13750)|
| 3:49:14| In looking at the numbers, it's apparent to me, and I don't have the exact number in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13754)|
| 3:49:18| but the city arrests a lot more people than they do in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13758)|
| 3:49:23| And so when you look at that, the city is definitely going to benefit from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13763)|
| 3:49:27| And so if you're looking at the city just bringing them down to the intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13767)|
| 3:49:30| then I imagine it would be up to the county to take all of them out to Maloneyville Road and to bring them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13770)|
| 3:49:36| This whole notion of perhaps a courtroom, and I'm told you don't need a very big facility out there to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13776)|
| 3:49:42| at the detention center, again, is something that I think that we really need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13782)|
| 3:49:46| And so with the questions that we have from the city, with some of these other things that I think need to be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13786)|
| 3:49:54| my feeling is that we need, and I would suggest, that we look at this in terms of our capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13794)|
| 3:50:00| Let's let all the parties sit down, and when we look at our budget here in a couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13800)|
| 3:50:05| let's see how this works into the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13805)|
| 3:50:07| And at that time, if we need to move ahead with a facility study, a feasibility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13807)|
| 3:50:13| then I'm all in favor of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| But just today, we have learned that we're going to have to look at $8 million, possibly, for our pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13815)|
| 3:50:21| The schools have already come in and said that they're going to have needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13821)|
| 3:50:25| And the list just goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| And so for me to vote today, to vote to spend $300,000 to $400,000 on a feasibility study, I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13827)|
| 3:50:36| I just feel like it needs to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13836)|
| 3:50:39| And I just want to end by I don't know how everybody knows or is feeling the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13839)|
| 3:50:44| but businesses are feeling it all over town right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13844)|
| 3:50:48| And when we were out at Gibbs, I was out there with Mr. Armstrong and some others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13848)|
| 3:50:53| and I was struck by this story about the teacher who was telling about the child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13853)|
| 3:50:58| who had shared that her father had sold his tools to buy Christmas gifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13858)|
| 3:51:04| and how the student was very concerned about how her daddy was going to make a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13864)|
| 3:51:09| that he was looking for a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| And so I can't vote for $300,000 or $400,000 during this economic environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13871)|
| 3:51:15| I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13875)|
| 3:51:16| I mean, if we're going to spend that kind of money, I'd rather spend it on retraining people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13876)|
| 3:51:20| or taking a look at something we can do on job creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13880)|
| 3:51:23| So my vote will be not that I don't feel that the intake center is not something we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13883)|
| 3:51:28| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13888)|
| 3:51:29| But I think it needs to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13889)|
| 3:51:31| It needs to go through our capital plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13891)|
| 3:51:34| Let's have some discussions with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13894)|
| 3:51:35| Let's put some of these other things on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13895)|
| 3:51:37| and see if we can't work together to come out with a program that is going to be beneficial to all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13897)|
| 3:51:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13904)|
| 3:51:47| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13907)|
| 3:51:49| Yes, Commissioner Hammond, to a certain degree, you took the words right out of my mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13909)|
| 3:51:53| and that's why I asked for the floor back after the sheriff spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13913)|
| 3:51:57| because I wanted to make some of the same points that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13917)|
| 3:52:01| What I'm going to do is to withdraw this resolution from consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13921)|
| 3:52:06| But what I would like to do is to establish a task force that would consist of members of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13926)|
| 3:52:14| many members of the city council, the city police department, the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13934)|
| 3:52:19| and other interested parties so we can really get the facts about where the prisoners are coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13939)|
| 3:52:25| where they're going, and literally explore every alternative that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13945)|
| 3:52:30| including the courtrooms out at Maloneyville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13950)|
| 3:52:34| seeing if something can be done through technology and telecommunications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13954)|
| 3:52:39| even to see if there are some modifications that we can use on the prison down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13959)|
| 3:52:45| where we can hold these short-term prisoners that may be held for 72 hours or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13965)|
| 3:52:53| literally just to see if we can get waivers if there's a problem down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13973)|
| 3:52:57| This was the first time I was aware that we may try to get the suit that's 20 years old now dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13977)|
| 3:53:04| but look at every possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13984)|
| 3:53:06| I think it's something that we can't push under the rug and ignore for the reasons that Sheriff Jones just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13986)|
| 3:53:12| but it's something that we need to explore further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13992)|
| 3:53:17| And it's like a lot of things that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| The further we dig into it, the more complex it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=13999)|
| 3:53:22| but also it increases the likelihood that we're going to make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14002)|
| 3:53:26| So my recommendation or what I'm going to do is to withdraw this from consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14006)|
| 3:53:32| We need to vote on that, so if you'll make a motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14012)|
| 3:53:37| So you made a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14017)|
| 3:53:38| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14018)|
| 3:53:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14019)|
| 3:53:42| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14022)|
| 3:53:44| I think the idea of a task force is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14024)|
| 3:53:47| That's a great idea, and I ask that if you move forward with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14027)|
| 3:53:49| that you also include somebody from the 10-year plan to prevent chronic homelessness on that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14029)|
| 3:54:02| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14042)|
| 3:54:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14044)|

| 3:56:06| Both of these next two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14166)|
| 3:56:09| You'll have two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14169)|
| 3:56:10| As far as options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14170)|
| 3:56:12| For further action on the blooded property ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14172)|
| 3:56:15| First option would be for us to go in and demolish the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14175)|
| 3:56:18| Demolish the structures under the dirty lot ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14178)|
| 3:56:21| And then attach a lien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14181)|
| 3:56:22| File a lien on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| The second option would be to follow through with this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14184)|
| 3:56:28| And seize the properties via eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14188)|
| 3:56:31| Those are the options that are before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14191)|
| 3:56:33| And granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14193)|
| 3:56:34| it should be stated for the record that both of these came before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14194)|
| 3:56:37| vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14197)|
| 3:56:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14198)|
| 3:56:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14199)|
| 3:56:40| And in your packets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14200)|
| 3:56:41| we have all the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14201)|
| 3:56:42| all the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14202)|
| 3:56:43| Those are the most recent photos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14203)|
| 3:56:44| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14204)|
| 3:56:45| from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14205)|
| 3:56:46| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14206)|
| 3:56:47| yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14207)|
| 3:56:48| they've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14208)|
| 3:56:49| as commissioner Harmon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14209)|
| 3:56:50| they've been through the vacant property review commission twice on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14210)|
| 3:56:52| first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14212)|
| 3:56:53| And then they gave a 90 day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14213)|
| 3:56:54| And after those 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14214)|
| 3:56:55| the vacant property review commission has referred it to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14215)|
| 3:56:58| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14218)|
| 3:57:01| This is for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14223)|
| 3:57:04| Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14224)|
| 3:57:05| If we seize that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| My eminent domain more than likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14227)|
| 3:57:10| This will go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14230)|
| 3:57:15| I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14235)|
| 3:57:16| As far as the owners are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14236)|
| 3:57:18| Most likely it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14238)|
| 3:57:20| because that's how you take property by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14240)|
| 3:57:23| But if we seize it by eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14243)|
| 3:57:25| don't we have to give them some monetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14245)|
| 3:57:29| Something for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14249)|
| 3:57:30| We can't just take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14250)|
| 3:57:31| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14251)|
| 3:57:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14252)|
| 3:57:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14253)|
| 3:57:34| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14254)|
| 3:57:35| but we do have to get an appraisal on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14255)|
| 3:57:36| And yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14256)|
| 3:57:37| that's what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14257)|
| 3:57:38| We're in our county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14258)|
| 3:57:42| In need for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14262)|
| 3:57:44| And whether we would have the money to tear these properties down or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14264)|
| 3:57:47| That's what I've talked to Grant about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14267)|
| 3:57:50| Can we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14270)|
| 3:57:52| Seize this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14272)|
| 3:57:53| but eminent domain and then auction off and let the push stipulation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14273)|
| 3:57:57| Whoever buys it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14277)|
| 3:57:58| tears the property down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14278)|
| 3:58:00| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14280)|
| 3:58:01| or cleans it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14281)|
| 3:58:02| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14282)|

| 3:58:05| or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14285)|
| 3:58:06| We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14286)|
| 3:58:07| if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14287)|
| 3:58:08| commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14288)|
| 3:58:09| we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14289)|
| 3:58:10| we had our internally had our public works crew go out to get an estimate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14290)|
| 3:58:12| the demolition for the structured Fontaine road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14292)|
| 3:58:15| And they came back with a figure around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| Twelve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14297)|
| 3:58:18| five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14298)|
| 3:58:19| $12,500 for us to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14299)|
| 3:58:21| And if we were to do that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| we would put the lien,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14303)|
| 3:58:24| put a lien on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14304)|
| 3:58:25| And I assume if we did that through them in a domain process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14305)|
| 3:58:28| we recoup that money and auctioning it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14308)|
| 3:58:31| He's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14311)|
| 3:58:33| And I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14313)|
| 3:58:34| we have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14314)|
| 3:58:35| Demolish the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14315)|
| 3:58:37| which there's a cost to or acquired by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14317)|
| 3:58:41| And there's a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14321)|
| 3:58:43| So we're going to absorb the cost one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14323)|
| 3:58:47| We can hopefully recoup it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14327)|
| 3:58:51| If we acquire the property and clean it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14331)|
| 3:58:55| do whatever we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14335)|
| 3:58:56| it's ours at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14336)|
| 3:58:58| I just want to be sure that we can recoup our money if we need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14338)|
| 3:59:01| you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14341)|
| 3:59:02| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14342)|
| 3:59:03| we can do what we will with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| And the market will determine if we recoup what money we spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14345)|
| 3:59:09| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14349)|
| 3:59:10| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14350)|
| 3:59:11| a $12,500 for demolition is a fairly de minimis number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14351)|
| 3:59:16| I brought up before in committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14356)|
| 3:59:18| and I would throw this out again for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14358)|
| 3:59:21| the caveat to acquiring property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14361)|
| 3:59:24| and I have no reason to believe and no one has said to me that there are any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14364)|
| 3:59:29| environmental issues with either of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14369)|
| 3:59:33| But with blighted properties and properties that have perhaps been used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14373)|
| 3:59:40| industrial or commercial purposes in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14380)|
| 3:59:43| we have to be very careful that we don't acquire property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14383)|
| 3:59:46| that there are environmental issues that attach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14386)|
| 3:59:50| Because when we take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14390)|
| 3:59:51| we take those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14391)|
| 3:59:53| And we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14393)|
| 3:59:55| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14395)|
| 3:59:56| spend whatever is necessary to cure those problems before we can sell the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14396)|
| 4:00:01| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14401)|
| 4:00:02| So the only reason I mention that is if there is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14402)|
| 4:00:08| if it's the sentiment of the commission that we act by eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14408)|
| 4:00:13| I would like included in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14413)|
| 4:00:16| I think it's prudent that before we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14416)|
| 4:00:21| that there be a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14421)|
| 4:00:24| And we do more than a phase one environmental on these properties to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14424)|
| 4:00:28| determine if there are any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14428)|
| 4:00:30| If there's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14430)|
| 4:00:31| then fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14431)|
| 4:00:32| go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14432)|
| 4:00:33| But if there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14433)|
| 4:00:35| then we obviously would not want to take title to either one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14435)|
| 4:00:39| properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14439)|
| 4:00:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14444)|
| 4:00:46| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14446)|
| 4:00:47| If we do acquire this by eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14447)|
| 4:00:50| we're required to pay the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14450)|
| 4:00:53| the appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14453)|
| 4:00:55| which say it happens to be even $15,000 in this case on Fontaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14455)|
| 4:01:04| Then we're going to spend $12,500 to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14464)|
| 4:01:09| A lot there in that area of less than an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14469)|
| 4:01:18| I don't think we'll bring $27,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14478)|
| 4:01:23| I'm not a real estate person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14483)|
| 4:01:24| but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14484)|
| 4:01:25| that's a high dollar price for a lot of what we've got invested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14485)|
| 4:01:32| Is there a question for me, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14492)|
| 4:01:34| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14494)|
| 4:01:36| Like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14496)|
| 4:01:37| the two options are demolition and place a lien on the property or eminent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14497)|
| 4:01:44| domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14504)|
| 4:01:45| If we acquire it by eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14505)|
| 4:01:46| we don't have to demolish the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14506)|
| 4:01:49| We just acquire it by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14509)|
| 4:01:52| But if you put a lien on it and then demolish it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14512)|
| 4:01:55| or demolish it and put a lien on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14515)|
| 4:01:58| the only way that has a certain time limit before that runs out, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14518)|
| 4:02:05| The lien, is it two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14525)|
| 4:02:09| I don't believe there is a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14529)|
| 4:02:12| What I'm getting at is that if we went that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14532)|
| 4:02:15| the only way the property owner could get it back would be to pay off the lien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14535)|
| 4:02:20| That's the only way that the property could be unencumbered with the lien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14540)|
| 4:02:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14544)|
| 4:02:25| So could that be, does it have to be the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14545)|
| 4:02:29| Could it be anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14549)|
| 4:02:32| No, it doesn't have to be the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14552)|
| 4:02:35| So one way, if we demolish it and take it by eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14555)|
| 4:02:44| we're putting a double cost on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14564)|
| 4:02:46| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14566)|
| 4:02:47| Well, if that's what you elect to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14567)|
| 4:02:50| But like I said, you don't have to demolish it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14570)|
| 4:02:53| and acquire it by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14573)|
| 4:02:56| You can acquire it by eminent domain and leave it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14576)|
| 4:03:00| Well, it's becoming not only an eyesore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14580)|
| 4:03:04| but it could be a danger to neighborhood kids and one thing or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14584)|
| 4:03:09| Then you need to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14589)|
| 4:03:11| But what I'm saying is if we go the lien route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14591)|
| 4:03:15| we have a chance to recoup that money somewhere down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14595)|
| 4:03:22| rather than a double cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14602)|
| 4:03:24| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14604)|
| 4:03:27| Mr. Law Director, if we seize this property by eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14607)|
| 4:03:31| now you correct me if I'm wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14611)|
| 4:03:34| we can auction it off with the stipulations that it should be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14614)|
| 4:03:41| Then, you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14621)|
| 4:03:44| then if anybody buys it, I don't care if they give $10,000 for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14624)|
| 4:03:48| they're going to have to go to the cost of tearing it down themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14628)|
| 4:03:51| Can we not put those deed restrictions in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14631)|
| 4:03:53| We'll put it up and bring it up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14633)|
| 4:03:55| Or bring it up to code is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| I don't think this house could be brought up to code, so do you, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14637)|
| 4:04:00| But anyway, what I'm saying is could we not seize it by eminent domain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14640)|
| 4:04:05| and if we auction it off, that has set the appraised value on it, hasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14645)|
| 4:04:09| That's what we're on now, on Ingalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14649)|
| 4:04:11| If we auction it off, no matter what it brings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14651)|
| 4:04:13| that's set the appraisal on it when it's a public auction, more or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14653)|
| 4:04:16| wouldn't you think so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14656)|
| 4:04:17| Well, right now the property is blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14657)|
| 4:04:23| so it's not worth a whole lot really on the open market as far as fair market value goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14663)|
| 4:04:28| We have to get an appraisal if you decide to condemn the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14668)|
| 4:04:33| and see what that appraisal says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14673)|
| 4:04:35| Basically, it's worth the cost of a lot in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14675)|
| 4:04:39| Well, let's get an appraisal and see because who knows what factors the appraiser will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14679)|
| 4:04:45| Since this property is blighted and we're talking about demolishing whatever is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14685)|
| 4:04:51| who knows, I can't say as we sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14691)|
| 4:04:55| but an appraiser might take into consideration the fact that that amount is going to have to be spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14695)|
| 4:05:01| and weigh that against the fair market value, all things being equal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14701)|
| 4:05:06| the appraisal could come back very, very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14706)|
| 4:05:12| Grant, could you get an appraisal on this for next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14712)|
| 4:05:16| Well, we waited on the appraisal because it costs money to get an appraisal done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14716)|
| 4:05:22| Hugh's not here, is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14722)|
| 4:05:24| Hugh Holt's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14724)|
| 4:05:25| He shouldn't cost a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14725)|
| 4:05:26| That's not a commercial piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14726)|
| 4:05:27| It's about $1,500 for an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| $350?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14729)|
| 4:05:30| $1,500, around $1,500, $1,200 to $1,500 for an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14730)|
| 4:05:35| That's what I've been told on other properties similar in size and scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14735)|
| 4:05:40| The tax appraised value is $28,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14740)|
| 4:05:44| There are $3,300 in taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14744)|
| 4:05:47| It's passed due on taxes six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14747)|
| 4:05:50| Well, why haven't we already auctioned that property off if it's behind six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14750)|
| 4:05:54| Mr. Lutho, after four years, aren't we supposed to auction this property off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14754)|
| 4:05:58| Well, you've got to take into account several things when you're putting together a tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14758)|
| 4:06:03| one of them being, is it a piece of property that can sell and bring in how much taxes are due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14763)|
| 4:06:11| And the number of, although the trustee's office collects within a three-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14771)|
| 4:06:20| about 99% of all taxes, still 1% out of 200,000 plus parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14780)|
| 4:06:27| That's still quite a few parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14787)|
| 4:06:30| We're having tax sales now, well, almost every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14790)|
| 4:06:35| so you still don't want to flood the market with too many properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14795)|
| 4:06:39| So the trustee is very selective in trying to get properties on there that, in a tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14799)|
| 4:06:45| that we keep the number to where we can sell those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14805)|
| 4:06:50| And so why this one is or is not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14810)|
| 4:06:55| There's no requirement that we have to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14815)|
| 4:06:57| It's just that we have to wait at least three years before we can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14817)|
| 4:07:02| Grant, do you have a figure on what the total back taxes are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14822)|
| 4:07:05| $3,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14825)|
| 4:07:08| $3,277.49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14828)|
| 4:07:13| Is it inside the city limits or is it county only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14833)|
| 4:07:15| It's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14835)|
| 4:07:16| County only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14836)|
| 4:07:20| Are you done, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14840)|
| 4:07:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14842)|
| 4:07:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14843)|
| 4:07:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14844)|
| 4:07:25| Also, Grant, I see that we spent $501.69 to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14845)|
| 4:07:31| This has been four or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14851)|
| 4:07:32| Did we ever get our money from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14852)|
| 4:07:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14854)|
| 4:07:35| And we've cleaned it up, I think, at least twice over the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14855)|
| 4:07:39| Most recently, after the first vacant property review commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14859)|
| 4:07:42| we went out and just mowed the lot, boarded up just kind of a stopgap measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14862)|
| 4:07:47| and spent a couple hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| I've not heard from the property owners, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14869)|
| 4:07:53| This will be my next question if anyone was here representing the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14873)|
| 4:07:57| And I'm guessing not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14877)|
| 4:07:59| So this goes all the way back to 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14879)|
| 4:08:02| And so we passed this ordinance as a result of citizens who were coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14882)|
| 4:08:06| and saying something needs to be done because we're creating some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14886)|
| 4:08:09| I would remind you that the vacant lot committee has been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14889)|
| 4:08:14| We've heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14894)|
| 4:08:15| We have sent registered letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14895)|
| 4:08:17| We've given 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14897)|
| 4:08:18| We've heard absolutely nothing from the folks who owns this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14898)|
| 4:08:22| So now it's where the rubber meets the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14902)|
| 4:08:25| If we're going to have this ordinance, we're going to need to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14905)|
| 4:08:28| If we're not going to enforce it, then we don't need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14908)|
| 4:08:31| because we're just spinning our wheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| And so this is why we're bringing it to you here today is as the vacant lot committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14913)|
| 4:08:37| we've done all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14917)|
| 4:08:38| And so the next step now is for the commission to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14918)|
| 4:08:40| and determine how they want to deal with these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14920)|
| 4:08:45| I would like to see Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14925)|
| 4:08:47| Grant, that's awful high for an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14927)|
| 4:08:50| I don't know who we're doing business with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14930)|
| 4:08:52| but we may need to start shopping these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14932)|
| 4:08:55| I mean, appraisals were just a lot in a house like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14935)|
| 4:09:07| Yeah, Commissioner Pinkson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14947)|
| 4:09:08| I just want to report that Hugh does have several appraisers that are under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14948)|
| 4:09:12| and each one is negotiated based on the complexity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14952)|
| 4:09:15| And so what Grant was talking about was just an estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14955)|
| 4:09:18| and I'm sure that Hugh would negotiate the lowest possible appraisal cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14958)|
| 4:09:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14962)|
| 4:09:23| I'm going to make a suggestion that we get this appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14963)|
| 4:09:26| and act on this next month as appraisal, find out what it costs, what it's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14966)|
| 4:09:31| and then we need to go ahead and take action on it, seize it by eminent domain or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14971)|
| 4:09:37| But we need to get this appraisal on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| We don't need to leave the county out here owing a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14979)|
| 4:09:43| And so I'd be willing to spend, you know, $700 or something like that to save the county money in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14983)|
| 4:09:49| Are you making that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14989)|
| 4:09:51| I'm making that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14991)|
| 4:09:52| Will you restate that so everybody is clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14992)|
| 4:09:55| I would like for Grant to come back next month with appraisal not exceeding $700| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=14995)|
| 4:10:00| and us to take immediate action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15000)|
| 4:10:04| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15004)|
| 4:10:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15006)|
| 4:10:07| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15007)|
| 4:10:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15008)|
| 4:10:09| Do we have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15009)|
| 4:10:11| I got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15011)|
| 4:10:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15012)|
| 4:10:13| How are we going to get our $700 back after we get the appraisal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15013)|
| 4:10:17| Will that come out of their sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15017)|
| 4:10:19| I'm hoping it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15019)|
| 4:10:20| If the appraisal comes out at, say, $15,000, it costs $12,500 to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15020)|
| 4:10:27| We auction it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15027)|
| 4:10:28| That's $13,200 we've got in it that we may have to give the people whatever the price is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15028)|
| 4:10:36| Commissioner Pinkston, there's just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15036)|
| 4:10:37| If we can't get an appraisal done for $700, what do you suggest we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15037)|
| 4:10:41| I suggest we start hunting other people to do our appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15041)|
| 4:10:44| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15044)|
| 4:10:45| I think that price for an appraisal is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15045)|
| 4:10:48| I mean, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15048)|
| 4:10:49| I'm not saying it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15049)|
| 4:10:50| I think $700 is too much, but I'm willing to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15050)|
| 4:10:56| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15056)|
| 4:10:58| The same vein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15058)|
| 4:10:59| Do you think that's possible for you to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15059)|
| 4:11:02| Yeah, we can look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15062)|
| 4:11:04| And forgive me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15064)|
| 4:11:05| I think when I mentioned the appraisal, I was thinking of a survey, the cost of a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15065)|
| 4:11:10| and that's where that figure came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15070)|
| 4:11:12| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15072)|
| 4:11:13| That was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15073)|
| 4:11:14| It may be much less than that, which we'd probably have to get as well if we were to acquire via an eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15074)|
| 4:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15083)|
| 4:11:24| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15084)|
| 4:11:27| The motion on the floor is to have an appraisal done at a cost at no more of $700| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15087)|
| 4:11:34| and for Grant to come back here before us next month and report what he's found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15094)|
| 4:11:38| And take immediate action one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15098)|
| 4:11:40| We'll take action one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15100)|
| 4:11:43| Everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15103)|
| 4:11:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15107)|
| 4:11:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15108)|
| 4:11:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15109)|
| 4:11:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15110)|
| 4:11:52| Chairman, it's back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15112)|
| 4:11:53| 9-0-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15113)|
| 4:11:58| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15118)|
| 4:12:01| to take further action in regard to the vacant, deteriorated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15121)|
| 4:12:04| or blotted property ordinance for property located at 7142 and 7144 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15124)|
| 4:12:10| seal team at 067, parcel 092, resolution 9-0-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15130)|
| 4:12:16| Finance, 8-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15136)|
| 4:12:20| 6-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15140)|
| 4:12:25| Once again, I present this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15145)|
| 4:12:27| This is a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15147)|
| 4:12:29| The property has been in violation of our blotted property ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15149)|
| 4:12:33| It's been through two meetings of the vacant property review commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15153)|
| 4:12:37| The owner has been given time to comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15157)|
| 4:12:39| had not heard from the owner until last month's vacant property review commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15159)|
| 4:12:44| Both unanimous votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15164)|
| 4:12:47| How much property is in this piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15167)|
| 4:12:50| I believe it's around ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15170)|
| 4:12:53| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15173)|
| 4:12:54| About eight or ten acres or so, the size of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15174)|
| 4:13:01| How much are they behind in taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15181)|
| 4:13:03| I think they're up to date on their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15183)|
| 4:13:10| Mr. Commissioner Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15190)|
| 4:13:12| Yeah, I've actually been out in the hall discussing this with Mr. Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15192)|
| 4:13:19| First, I'd like to ask the law director what our powers are on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15199)|
| 4:13:24| What can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15204)|
| 4:13:26| The way I understand it, we can declare it blotted and we can take it through eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15206)|
| 4:13:33| And I understand that we also have the power to tear down the blotted building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15213)|
| 4:13:38| and send the property owner a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15218)|
| 4:13:42| Am I correct in that assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15222)|
| 4:13:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15224)|
| 4:13:45| We can condemn the property through eminent domain going through the statutory process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15225)|
| 4:13:51| or we can declare it blotted and take the necessary action to correct whatever it is that results in the property being blotted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15231)|
| 4:14:01| place a lien on the property for that amount, and bill the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15241)|
| 4:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15246)|
| 4:14:07| Mr. Labbert, you're the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15247)|
| 4:14:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15251)|
| 4:14:12| You know, what you want to do carries a lot of weight with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15252)|
| 4:14:16| I don't know if you watch commission meetings, but I am extremely strong on property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15256)|
| 4:14:21| and I have been very critical of other municipalities who I feel like have misused the power of eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15261)|
| 4:14:31| This is something that I don't believe that we should do lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15271)|
| 4:14:36| I have spoken with Arthur Seymour, and I believe he's your counsel on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15276)|
| 4:14:42| Well, I just discussed it with him because we were talking about it today that we're satisfied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15282)|
| 4:14:52| particularly under that Connecticut case, that you can only take the property for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15292)|
| 4:14:59| Well, you know, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15299)|
| 4:15:01| My understanding of the law is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15301)|
| 4:15:03| We can take it because of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15303)|
| 4:15:06| Well, that is not what the county law director's office sent to us back in August of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15306)|
| 4:15:16| The only thing they sent to us was the ordinances that provided for you to be able to take the property by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15316)|
| 4:15:26| I'm hearing him today say that you have a right to tear the building down and send us a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15326)|
| 4:15:33| And we asked back in August of his office to send us a copy of the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15333)|
| 4:15:41| because you see your ordinances have not been published since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15341)|
| 4:15:47| So we have the citizens and us lawyers have no way of getting copies of the ordinances you all pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15347)|
| 4:15:55| or know what they say except to request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15355)|
| 4:15:59| And when we received in September of last year the letter pertaining to this, it made reference to ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15359)|
| 4:16:13| and we called and we were faxed and sent two ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15373)|
| 4:16:19| neither one of which says anything about being able to tear our building down and send us a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15379)|
| 4:16:27| But apparently the law director has something that he's referring to in stating that you do have that power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15387)|
| 4:16:38| and I have never seen that ordinance, and it was not sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15398)|
| 4:16:44| Well, Joe, this is not a courtroom, and the merits of the law, I'm sure, can be debated elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15404)|
| 4:16:52| What I want to know is do you want us to act on this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15412)|
| 4:16:56| or would you like for us to put this off for 30 days so that we can have an opportunity to meet with you and your counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15416)|
| 4:17:04| Well, since when do I have any say about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15424)|
| 4:17:07| You are the only person in 20 years that's ever complained about that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15427)|
| 4:17:15| And I don't know whether you have a personal axe to grind about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15435)|
| 4:17:19| You've told me three or four different stories about why you're interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15439)|
| 4:17:24| Today I'm learning because the owners of the property back behind us that don't live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15444)|
| 4:17:31| an out-of-state corporation, seems to have an interest in our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15451)|
| 4:17:36| Are they wanting you to condemn our property so they can buy it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15456)|
| 4:17:40| They've never contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15460)|
| 4:17:42| No one has ever made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15462)|
| 4:17:44| I have gotten numerous complaints throughout the community, property owners across the street, property owners behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15464)|
| 4:17:53| You know, the Powell community, this property has been vacant for around 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15473)|
| 4:17:59| That's true. It's been vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15479)|
| 4:18:01| And the Powell community has complained about this and complained about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15481)|
| 4:18:07| To who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15487)|
| 4:18:08| To their county commissioners. My predecessors were giving complaints about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15488)|
| 4:18:11| And you have yet to forward a single complaint to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15491)|
| 4:18:17| We turn complaints over to Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15497)|
| 4:18:20| The Office of Neighborhoods has followed up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15500)|
| 4:18:23| They have sent you numerous correspondence telling you that you had a problem with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15503)|
| 4:18:28| This was heard not once but twice in front of the Blighted Properties Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15508)|
| 4:18:35| And not one shred of evidence was put in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15515)|
| 4:18:39| Grant, do you want to respond to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15519)|
| 4:18:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15524)|
| 4:18:45| Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15525)|
| 4:18:47| Grant presented numerous photographic evidence as to the condition of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15527)|
| 4:18:54| I've toured the property several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15534)|
| 4:18:56| I drive by it almost every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15536)|
| 4:18:59| I've asked other commissioners to go out and tour the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15539)|
| 4:19:03| Of course, because of the Open Meetings Act, I haven't held their hand and walked them around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15543)|
| 4:19:08| But, you know, the evidence of blight is quite prevalent when you look around that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15548)|
| 4:19:15| And what we're here today is not to decide whether this property is blighted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15555)|
| 4:19:20| That has already been determined by the Blighted Properties Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15560)|
| 4:19:25| both times of which you had the opportunity to present your case and did at the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15565)|
| 4:19:33| What we're trying to decide now is what we want to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15573)|
| 4:19:37| Now, I'm not like the folks in Kelo, Massachusetts or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15577)|
| 4:19:42| You know, I believe that you, as the property owner, that still carries a lot of weight with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15582)|
| 4:19:49| And if there's something that we can do, if we could offer you some tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15589)|
| 4:19:55| if there's anything that we can do to help you get your property up to code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15595)|
| 4:20:00| I'm willing to go on this commission and fight for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15600)|
| 4:20:03| But what I'm not willing to do is do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15603)|
| 4:20:06| Because nothing is what's been done with that property for the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15606)|
| 4:20:10| And it is a blight on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15610)|
| 4:20:12| And there have been numerous complaints from numerous citizens groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15612)|
| 4:20:16| And when I drive by that property every day, I see blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15616)|
| 4:20:21| And so today what we're deciding is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15621)|
| 4:20:27| And if I understand correctly that we could declare this property blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15627)|
| 4:20:34| take it through eminent domain or force the sale of it through eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15634)|
| 4:20:39| we can tear this property down, at which point you would be billed for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15639)|
| 4:20:43| Or the third thing we can do is if you would like to put this off 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15643)|
| 4:20:47| then me, you and Grant and your counsel can sit down together and see if we can come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15647)|
| 4:20:54| But if you're going to continue to say there's nothing wrong with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15654)|
| 4:20:59| and you refuse to do anything about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15659)|
| 4:21:01| then I don't see that there's any compromise that can be achieved by having a meeting and waiting 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15661)|
| 4:21:09| But if you're willing to work with us to clean the property up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15669)|
| 4:21:14| to secure the property so that it's no longer blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15674)|
| 4:21:17| then I'm willing to jump through any hoops possible to help you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15677)|
| 4:21:22| Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15682)|
| 4:21:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15683)|
| 4:21:24| The photographs that are attached to the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15684)|
| 4:21:30| those photographs were part of the presentation before the Blighted Property Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15690)|
| 4:21:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15696)|
| 4:21:37| Those are actually the most recent photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15697)|
| 4:21:40| The previous meetings we've had other photographs taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15700)|
| 4:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15704)|
| 4:21:45| We have all that that's been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15705)|
| 4:21:49| But I wanted to address the statement that was made by Mr. Leavitt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15709)|
| 4:21:55| that there was not a shred of evidence presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15715)|
| 4:21:58| And if you would outline for commission what evidence was presented that this property was blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15718)|
| 4:22:05| Many photographs are submitted in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15725)|
| 4:22:09| You can look through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15729)|
| 4:22:10| And actually in the initial letter we had sent Mr. Leavitt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15730)|
| 4:22:14| and we also had sent him a copy of the ordinance itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15734)|
| 4:22:16| it actually has definitions of blight in the ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15736)|
| 4:22:19| I think there's eight or so definitions that you can qualify to certify blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15739)|
| 4:22:26| And I guess for edification of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15746)|
| 4:22:30| and those who've heard Mr. Leavitt say there was no evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15750)|
| 4:22:35| it's up to the chair and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15755)|
| 4:22:37| but the attachments to the resolution does have photographs of this property showing its condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15757)|
| 4:22:44| And I will clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15764)|
| 4:22:46| We are not, we are authorized to tear the structure down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15766)|
| 4:22:50| and assess a lien on the property under the dirty lot ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15770)|
| 4:22:55| It's a separate ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15775)|
| 4:22:56| But he's also, he's been cited for that ordinance in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15776)|
| 4:22:59| We just have to give 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15779)|
| 4:23:02| We can go out tomorrow, and our office does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15782)|
| 4:23:05| and that's not even a decision for the Blighted Property Review Commission, for the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15785)|
| 4:23:11| The reason I'm bringing this before you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15791)|
| 4:23:13| and the reason I'm bringing this action of the dirty lot ordinance before you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15793)|
| 4:23:17| is because I don't have the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15797)|
| 4:23:19| I don't have that money in my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15799)|
| 4:23:21| I don't have a line item that can cover the cost of demolishing a structure this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15801)|
| 4:23:25| That's why I bring it before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15805)|
| 4:23:28| Grant, Grant, may I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15808)|
| 4:23:32| Didn't Mr. Leavitt's partner come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15812)|
| 4:23:37| asking us to extend some time for him to try to do something to clean that lot up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15817)|
| 4:23:43| He did or didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15823)|
| 4:23:44| I don't recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15824)|
| 4:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15825)|
| 4:23:46| I know that there were a lot of people up here, because this is in Mr. Lambert's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15826)|
| 4:23:48| talking to us about it and wanting something done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15828)|
| 4:23:51| I don't know if they were complaining about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15831)|
| 4:23:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15832)|
| 4:23:53| But I thought a partner or somebody talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15833)|
| 4:23:55| There was a letter brought forth at the first meeting asking for, I think, asking for some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15835)|
| 4:24:02| I can't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15842)|
| 4:24:04| The Vacant Property Review Commission had that letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15844)|
| 4:24:06| but the commission decided to go ahead and certify it, blight it, and give the 90-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15846)|
| 4:24:11| So he had 90 days from that meeting to bring the property into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15851)|
| 4:24:17| I'm seeing on this screen a whole bunch of pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15857)|
| 4:24:25| Those pictures were never ever presented at any meeting of this Knox County Vacant Property, I guess, Review Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15865)|
| 4:24:38| False statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15878)|
| 4:24:39| They looked at those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15879)|
| 4:24:40| They certainly didn't look at them when I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15880)|
| 4:24:45| There was no presentation of a single statement other than just like right now that they were not put into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15885)|
| 4:24:58| There was nobody that was no pictures were shown to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15898)|
| 4:25:04| There were no pictures that I was aware of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15904)|
| 4:25:11| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15911)|
| 4:25:12| Are you saying that they were a part of a hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15912)|
| 4:25:15| As a member of the Vacant Property Review Committee, I can tell you that those pictures played a prominent role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15915)|
| 4:25:20| They were distributed around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15920)|
| 4:25:22| They were presented to the gentleman speaking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15922)|
| 4:25:25| Those pictures were a prominent part of the reason we made the decision we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15925)|
| 4:25:30| They were part of the packet, and they were discussed thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15930)|
| 4:25:34| But I'm learning for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15934)|
| 4:25:38| No, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15938)|
| 4:25:39| You're selectively remembering and trying to throw it all back on us, and we're tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15939)|
| 4:25:44| You say there was a packet at that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15944)|
| 4:25:48| I was never given a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15948)|
| 4:25:51| Mr. Leavitt, let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15951)|
| 4:25:53| Is this your property that's shown in these pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15953)|
| 4:25:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15956)|
| 4:25:57| And is this the current condition of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15957)|
| 4:26:00| I've got bad cataracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15960)|
| 4:26:07| I actually drove on my way to the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15967)|
| 4:26:09| If the pictures were made in July, I would think they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15969)|
| 4:26:16| But we have boarded the building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15976)|
| 4:26:20| It's sitting on a ten-and-a-half-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15980)|
| 4:26:27| We never had the first complaint either from the commissioner, from anybody about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15987)|
| 4:26:37| We have left it boarded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=15997)|
| 4:26:42| Commissioner Hammond, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16002)|
| 4:26:43| But I'm particularly concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16003)|
| 4:26:45| I'm hearing that now under a different ordinance or ordinances that we were cited before the Knox County Vacant Property Review Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16005)|
| 4:27:00| that there's a different ordinance on which you're proposing to tear our building down and send us the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16020)|
| 4:27:09| You've been provided notice under both ordinances and have failed to respond according to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16029)|
| 4:27:16| That's why you're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16036)|
| 4:27:18| Okay, I can't dispute about if I'm not aware of a dirty lot citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16038)|
| 4:27:30| If you're saying that we were sent that, I'm not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16050)|
| 4:27:36| I'd have to check with my partner if he knows anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16056)|
| 4:27:39| But I'm not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16059)|
| 4:27:43| But all I was aware of was the citations that came before the Knox County Vacant Property Review Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16063)|
| 4:27:53| And I'm finding today that they considered some evidence that I never was told about, that apparently there was a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16073)|
| 4:28:05| And they privately must have looked at the packet because it was never shown to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16085)|
| 4:28:10| Mr. Levitz, the first time this evidence was presented was at the first blighted review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16090)|
| 4:28:19| And I saw that your representative there that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16099)|
| 4:28:22| She saw every bit of this evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16102)|
| 4:28:25| In fact, if I'm not mistaken, someone may have even given her a copy of those packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16105)|
| 4:28:31| And I see a fellow member shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16111)|
| 4:28:33| I believe she was given a copy of everything that we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16113)|
| 4:28:37| I had a woman there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16117)|
| 4:28:38| Yes, there was a young lady here that was representing your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16118)|
| 4:28:42| We actually have her on videotape if you want us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16122)|
| 4:28:46| I would like to see it because I don't have any representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16126)|
| 4:28:51| Someone appeared at a meeting representing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16131)|
| 4:28:54| Yes, she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16134)|
| 4:28:56| And I asked that it be postponed, and we said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16136)|
| 4:28:59| We said this is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16139)|
| 4:29:02| He can be there at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16142)|
| 4:29:04| This gentleman says he believes my secretary was up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16144)|
| 4:29:08| I believe it was the secretary delivering a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16148)|
| 4:29:10| I don't think she's representing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16150)|
| 4:29:11| Delivering a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16151)|
| 4:29:12| Nobody represented me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16152)|
| 4:29:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16154)|
| 4:29:16| She just came to deliver a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16156)|
| 4:29:18| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16158)|
| 4:29:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16160)|
| 4:29:21| Again, when you look at the record, this goes back again to 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16161)|
| 4:29:26| and I'm assuming that everything we have in front of us here is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16166)|
| 4:29:29| because you have complaints of vandalism there, children playing in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16169)|
| 4:29:35| You have an instance where the property was posted for violation of building code in 07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16175)|
| 4:29:41| a file sent to the law department for review in 07, 07, a file sent for demolition estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16181)|
| 4:29:47| then in 07 again, a violation of international property maintenance code, and it goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16187)|
| 4:29:53| But I guess my point is, Mr. Levitt, at the vacant property committee, you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16193)|
| 4:29:58| The easy thing to do, and the thing that we can all just go home happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16198)|
| 4:30:02| is if you would agree to clean up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16202)|
| 4:30:05| And when I asked you that question at the vacant property committee, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16205)|
| 4:30:09| Mr. Levitt, do you have any intention at all of cleaning up this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16209)|
| 4:30:13| I mean, is there anything that you would do to prevent it from being blighted so that we don't have to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16213)|
| 4:30:18| Your answer to me at that time was no, that you said, why don't you guys clean it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16218)|
| 4:30:22| Now, that was your comment to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16222)|
| 4:30:24| So this is what we're here today, is if you and your partners are not willing to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16224)|
| 4:30:30| and basically have the property come into compliance, then we're going to have to take some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16230)|
| 4:30:34| Well, the only thing you spoke to me about was you said that there was a truck there and a boat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16234)|
| 4:30:39| Well, these were the pictures that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16239)|
| 4:30:41| I mean, you know, and I mentioned to you, I said, we have pictures here of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16241)|
| 4:30:44| and I mentioned specifically a boat and a truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16244)|
| 4:30:47| So you do remember the pictures that were there because I referenced those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16247)|
| 4:30:50| No, I don't remember any pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16250)|
| 4:30:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16251)|
| 4:30:52| Well, those are the pictures that I referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16252)|
| 4:30:53| But, again, I would ask you again, you know, sir, would you clean up the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16253)|
| 4:30:58| But there's nothing there on the property except the boat and a truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16258)|
| 4:31:07| Now, what needs to be cleaned up on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16267)|
| 4:31:11| There's no trash laying out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16271)|
| 4:31:16| There's a boat, an old boat, and an older truck, dump truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16276)|
| 4:31:23| Now, what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16283)|
| 4:31:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16288)|
| 4:31:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16290)|
| 4:31:33| While I do appreciate Commissioner Lambert's sincere attempt to give Mr. Levitt an avenue out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16293)|
| 4:31:44| I think this conversation seems to be circular in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16304)|
| 4:31:48| and I think we have something before us that we need to act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16308)|
| 4:31:53| In my mind, there's no question it went before committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16313)|
| 4:31:56| and I really feel that the time of further discussion has probably passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16316)|
| 4:32:01| And so I'm going to move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16321)|
| 4:32:04| I don't know if there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16324)|
| 4:32:07| Has there been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16327)|
| 4:32:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16328)|
| 4:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16329)|
| 4:32:10| I'm going to move for approval of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16330)|
| 4:32:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16332)|
| 4:32:14| Approval to condemn it or approval to take further actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16334)|
| 4:32:20| I know, but we'd need to associate a further action with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16340)|
| 4:32:23| Well, demolish the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16343)|
| 4:32:27| Demolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16347)|
| 4:32:28| So your proposal is to demolish the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16348)|
| 4:32:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16350)|
| 4:32:31| And send Mr. Levitt a bill for the destruction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16351)|
| 4:32:33| Yes, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16353)|
| 4:32:34| My second would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16354)|
| 4:32:37| Did the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16357)|
| 4:32:39| Who was second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16359)|
| 4:32:41| Commissioner Norman, you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16361)|
| 4:32:43| You have something else, Commissioner Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16363)|
| 4:32:48| Mr. Levitt, I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16368)|
| 4:32:50| Where do you live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16370)|
| 4:32:51| You're on North Central?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16371)|
| 4:32:53| My office is on North Central, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16373)|
| 4:32:55| How often do you go by there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16375)|
| 4:32:57| How often do I go by there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16377)|
| 4:32:59| You act like you're not aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16379)|
| 4:33:02| I'm not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16382)|
| 4:33:04| Well, you know, sir, I mean, it's your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16384)|
| 4:33:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16386)|
| 4:33:07| And I think what they're trying to tell you here today, it's about community pride in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16387)|
| 4:33:14| The people across the street have real nice offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16394)|
| 4:33:16| I mean, you're not even cutting your grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16396)|
| 4:33:20| You're not boarding up the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16400)|
| 4:33:21| I mean, you're not taking any pride in your property whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16401)|
| 4:33:24| and trying to keep any type of value to it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16404)|
| 4:33:26| Well, now, I think we do mow the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16406)|
| 4:33:29| According to these pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16409)|
| 4:33:31| And it's gotten this grassy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16411)|
| 4:33:33| There might be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16413)|
| 4:33:35| I go by that property about once a week and see, and, you know, nothing's ever been done to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16415)|
| 4:33:39| So, I mean, you have no pride in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16419)|
| 4:33:41| You have no pride in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16421)|
| 4:33:42| You're just letting it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16422)|
| 4:33:44| You leave us no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16424)|
| 4:33:45| Well, up until two years ago, I personally mowed it just for the exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16425)|
| 4:33:51| and did it with push mowers so I could get the exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16431)|
| 4:33:55| Now, I haven't in the last two years, but we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16435)|
| 4:33:58| They've asked you to do some things, and you're just telling them, no, you're not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16438)|
| 4:34:02| So, I mean, it's a slap in the face to the rest of the community when you just say, I'm not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16442)|
| 4:34:09| I don't care about my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16449)|
| 4:34:11| I don't care what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16451)|
| 4:34:12| It brings their property value down, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16452)|
| 4:34:14| So you tear the building down because the grass isn't mowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16454)|
| 4:34:17| No, it's not much left of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16457)|
| 4:34:19| It looks like to these pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16459)|
| 4:34:21| I'd like to call for questions if it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16461)|
| 4:34:24| Well, I'm recognizing Commissioner Armstrong first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16464)|
| 4:34:29| Grant, how much will it cost to tear this building down and clean up that lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16469)|
| 4:34:35| We had two contractors go out and look at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16475)|
| 4:34:39| Now, they couldn't get inside and get a good look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16479)|
| 4:34:42| and determine if there's some environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16482)|
| 4:34:45| They gave us just if there were environmental issues, if there were asbestos issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16485)|
| 4:34:52| the highball costs were around between $130,000 and $140,000, $130,000 and $140,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16492)|
| 4:35:00| and that's turnkey taking care of the whole property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16500)|
| 4:35:04| What if there's not any asbestos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16504)|
| 4:35:06| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16506)|
| 4:35:08| It looks like you could knock off about $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16508)|
| 4:35:10| We're looking at $90,000 in this motion is what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16510)|
| 4:35:16| More than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16516)|
| 4:35:17| $130,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16517)|
| 4:35:18| $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16518)|
| 4:35:19| $90,000 to $130,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16519)|
| 4:35:20| No, $130,000 to $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16520)|
| 4:35:24| $130,000 to $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16524)|
| 4:35:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16525)|
| 4:35:26| But possibly $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16526)|
| 4:35:27| Possibly less, but, again, that was a conservative estimate without having access to the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16527)|
| 4:35:33| We would send the bill to Mr. Levitt here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16533)|
| 4:35:36| We'd send a bill to the property owner and put a lien on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16536)|
| 4:35:40| Well, you'd be in federal court before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16540)|
| 4:35:44| Mr. Levitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16544)|
| 4:35:50| We're at the end of a rope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16550)|
| 4:35:51| We're going to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16551)|
| 4:35:52| Would you prefer us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16552)|
| 4:35:54| Don't you realize what you just heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16554)|
| 4:35:57| You heard you were telling me that what you wanted was the building secured so people couldn't get in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16557)|
| 4:36:05| This gentleman has just told you he had two companies go out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16565)|
| 4:36:10| and they could not get access to the interior of the building to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16570)|
| 4:36:16| Could not get safe access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16576)|
| 4:36:18| I would say safe access because kids go in and out of that building all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16578)|
| 4:36:23| But, I mean, Mr. Levitt, there's a motion on the floor, and it may well pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16583)|
| 4:36:30| If you want it to pass, I'm sure it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16590)|
| 4:36:34| I lose a lot of votes sitting on this commission, so I don't see where you're getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16594)|
| 4:36:39| I have so much power, but I'm just going to ask you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16599)|
| 4:36:42| What would you prefer to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16602)|
| 4:36:44| Would you prefer us tear it down and send you a bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16604)|
| 4:36:47| Or would you prefer us to condemn the property through eminent domain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16607)|
| 4:36:53| Or is there some way that you can convince us, although your past action shows that you're unlikely to do anything with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16613)|
| 4:37:02| is there any evidence that you can offer to convince us that you're going to make this property something other than blotted in a short amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16622)|
| 4:37:12| With those as your three options, which do you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16632)|
| 4:37:15| Because that matters to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16635)|
| 4:37:17| I know you don't believe that, but it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16637)|
| 4:37:20| I care what you want to happen to property that you own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16640)|
| 4:37:24| So is there one of the options that I've mentioned that you find preferable to having the building torn down and you being sent a bill for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16644)|
| 4:37:35| If the third option is I do something with the building now to put it into use, that is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16655)|
| 4:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16667)|
| 4:37:48| Well, nobody said anything about use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16668)|
| 4:37:49| We just said something other than blotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16669)|
| 4:37:53| All I would expect to do would be to secure the building as we have normally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16673)|
| 4:38:05| As you've normally done in the past, I'm sitting here looking at a picture taken less than a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16685)|
| 4:38:12| and I can see that from the time you boarded it up, the criminal element has already, they've cut a hole in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16692)|
| 4:38:21| Well, it's not up on that screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16701)|
| 4:38:23| It's on my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16703)|
| 4:38:25| They've already gotten access to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16705)|
| 4:38:27| If you continue to, you know, the definition of insanity is to do what you've always done and expect different results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16707)|
| 4:38:35| Well, if all you're saying is that if we take no action that you're going to do what you've been doing, the results are going to be identical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16715)|
| 4:38:44| and the results are going to be a blighted piece of property running down the neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16724)|
| 4:38:50| So what I'm asking you, and you're not, you've said nothing to convince me or anybody else here, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16730)|
| 4:38:58| that you're going to do something different, that you're going to do something that would secure this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16738)|
| 4:39:02| So now our options are down to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16742)|
| 4:39:05| Would you prefer us eminent domain you, or would you prefer us to tear the building down and send you a bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16745)|
| 4:39:11| I prefer neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16751)|
| 4:39:13| Commissioner Lambert, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16753)|
| 4:39:15| The motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| I'm prepared to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16757)|
| 4:39:19| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16759)|
| 4:39:21| And I see two more lights, and I think I heard somebody say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16761)|
| 4:39:26| I didn't recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16766)|
| 4:39:28| You didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16768)|
| 4:39:30| I was going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16770)|
| 4:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16772)|
| 4:39:33| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16773)|
| 4:39:34| But I will defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16774)|
| 4:39:35| I would like to ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16775)|
| 4:39:37| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16777)|
| 4:39:38| It's sort of a basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16778)|
| 4:39:40| Could we assume that Mr. Levitt is here representing himself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16780)|
| 4:39:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16788)|
| 4:39:50| You are representing yourself, Mr. Levitt, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16790)|
| 4:39:53| Because I've heard you say other people have not represented you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16793)|
| 4:39:57| I don't understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16797)|
| 4:40:00| In regards to the action that's being taken against you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16800)|
| 4:40:03| you have said repeatedly that you know nothing of what's going on, that there has not been anyone represent you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16803)|
| 4:40:12| that you haven't seen pictures that are in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16812)|
| 4:40:15| And I think that maybe this needs to be a grassroots question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16815)|
| 4:40:18| Are you here representing yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16818)|
| 4:40:20| Yes, but I think it's also a grassroots question as to how members of any commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16820)|
| 4:40:27| or this commission or any board to review material privately that was not introduced at a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16827)|
| 4:40:45| Commissioner Briggs, you called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16845)|
| 4:40:48| I won't call for the question if we can go ahead and vote because that will save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16848)|
| 4:40:54| I don't see any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16854)|
| 4:40:55| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16855)|
| 4:40:57| And the motion is that you restate it, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16857)|
| 4:40:59| Could you repeat it, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16859)|
| 4:41:00| The motion is to demolish the structure and charge Mr. Levitt for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16860)|
| 4:41:12| There's a motion on the floor and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16872)|
| 4:41:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16874)|
| 4:41:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16875)|
| 4:41:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16876)|
| 4:41:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16878)|
| 4:41:21| We're going into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16881)|
| 4:41:23| Got to get a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16883)|

| 4:42:20| Zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16940)|
| 4:42:23| This is a request of WC Development for rezoning PR plan residential at up to three dwelling units per acre to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16943)|
| 4:42:30| at up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16950)|
| 4:42:32| Property located on the northeast side of Solway Road, north end of Till Green Lane in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16952)|
| 4:42:39| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16959)|
| 4:42:42| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16962)|
| 4:42:46| Sixth District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16966)|
| 4:42:48| Seeing no opposition, move to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16968)|
| 4:42:52| I would note MPC recommendation was four, and that's fine by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16972)|
| 4:42:57| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16977)|
| 4:42:59| You said five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16979)|
| 4:43:00| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=16980)|

| 4:43:26| I want to go to ordinances on first reading right above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17006)|
| 4:43:31| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, adopting beer laws for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17011)|
| 4:43:36| Knox County Code Part 2, Chapter 4, Article 1, Section 4 through 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17016)|
| 4:43:43| Previously reserved, this is on first reading, Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17023)|
| 4:43:46| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17026)|
| 4:43:50| Finance, no recommendation, 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17030)|
| 4:43:52| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17032)|
| 4:43:54| No recommendation, 4-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17034)|
| 4:43:57| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17037)|
| 4:43:59| Yeah, I'll let the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17039)|
| 4:44:01| Was Joe over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17041)|
| 4:44:02| I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17042)|
| 4:44:03| Joe, do you want to explain beer laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17043)|
| 4:44:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17047)|
| 4:44:08| Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17048)|
| 4:44:10| Just briefly, the ordinance before you essentially serves two purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17050)|
| 4:44:16| One, it reflects the desires and the directions from the beer board to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17056)|
| 4:44:23| One, to ensure that our sale of beers is in congruence with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17063)|
| 4:44:30| and two, to outline with more specificity the broadest range of fines and penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17070)|
| 4:44:37| It likewise includes an update to Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17077)|
| 4:44:41| This ordinance has not been updated since 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17081)|
| 4:44:45| The law has gone through several iterations since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17085)|
| 4:44:48| We've included in the ordinance the Responsible Vendor Act, which is required by Tennessee state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17088)|
| 4:44:54| and we've combined all other ordinances that have not yet been codified into one singular working document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17094)|
| 4:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17103)|
| 4:45:04| Go ahead, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17104)|
| 4:45:06| In terms of Mr. Jarrett, I'd like to recognize the yeoman's work he did in putting this ordinance together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17106)|
| 4:45:14| In terms, though, of it being congruent with the city of Knoxville's beer laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17114)|
| 4:45:19| that's only being done in terms of hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17119)|
| 4:45:23| There are other differences between our beer ordinance and the city of Knoxville's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17123)|
| 4:45:28| but this would make uniform the hours of operation for beer sales in the city of Knoxville and in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17128)|
| 4:45:36| Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the law department, especially Joe, for taking the lead on that and doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17136)|
| 4:45:41| We did a lot of research, went back and checked, but it was pretty much a no-brainer on changing the hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17141)|
| 4:45:46| And it did go before the beer board, and both of them passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17146)|
| 4:45:51| I'll make that a motion if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17151)|
| 4:45:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17154)|
| 4:45:55| Make a motion to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17155)|
| 4:45:56| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17156)|
| 4:45:57| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17157)|
| 4:45:58| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17158)|
| 4:46:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17160)|
| 4:46:01| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17161)|
| 4:46:02| You have something, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17162)|
| 4:46:04| Yeah, I just wanted to say again, Larry took a lot of leadership with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17164)|
| 4:46:10| This has been something that's needed to be done for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17170)|
| 4:46:13| It's something that don't really matter to most of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17173)|
| 4:46:16| but to folks in the convenience store industry when it comes to training their employees, this really helps them a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17176)|
| 4:46:23| And I just want to applaud the leadership Larry took on bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17183)|
| 4:46:28| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17188)|
| 4:46:29| It's properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17189)|
| 4:46:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17190)|
| 4:46:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17192)|
| 4:46:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17193)|
| 4:46:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17194)|
| 4:46:37| Going back through with our agenda, I think we have a lot of discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17197)|
| 4:47:01| We have discussion regarding the Department of Judicial Commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17221)|
| 4:47:05| Someone want to make a motion to withdraw this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17225)|
| 4:47:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17227)|
| 4:47:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17228)|
| 4:47:09| Properly moved and seconded that we withdraw that since we've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17229)|
| 4:47:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17233)|
| 4:47:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17235)|
| 4:47:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17236)|
| 4:47:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17237)|
| 4:47:18| Discussion regarding the Board of Zoning Appeals membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17238)|
| 4:47:22| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17242)|
| 4:47:25| Board of Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17245)|
| 4:47:26| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17246)|
| 4:47:27| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17247)|
| 4:47:28| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17248)|
| 4:47:31| Commissioner Shelf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17251)|
| 4:47:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17252)|
| 4:47:34| At the request of some constituents in the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17254)|
| 4:47:38| I brought this forward just to put it on the floor and get some discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17258)|
| 4:47:44| And let me just address it briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17264)|
| 4:47:46| I'll try not to ramble on as I did last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17266)|
| 4:47:51| I would like to, at the end of my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17271)|
| 4:47:53| I'd like to ask the Law Director his opinion on how this could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17273)|
| 4:48:00| I just thought it unusual and inconsistent a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17280)|
| 4:48:03| when the Supreme Court removed about a third of our commission because of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17283)|
| 4:48:09| And the commissioners, as we know, each of the nine commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17289)|
| 4:48:14| there's one person that originally is a county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17294)|
| 4:48:20| and they are appointed by their colleagues to be on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17300)|
| 4:48:25| When we lost those people two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17305)|
| 4:48:28| it appeared to be optional or it is optional by the outgoing commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17308)|
| 4:48:34| if they leave the Board of Zoning Appeals or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17314)|
| 4:48:37| And some left and some didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17317)|
| 4:48:40| I just thought it unusual that it was inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17320)|
| 4:48:43| and at the option of the outgoing commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17323)|
| 4:48:47| Some of our constituents, Commissioner Saunders and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17327)|
| 4:48:51| didn't agree with the way the Board of Zoning Appeals voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17331)|
| 4:48:57| We've all been exposed to issues like this, and it was unfortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17337)|
| 4:49:01| but it was a situation that they wanted a representative commissioner to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17341)|
| 4:49:13| instead of a former commissioner, I guess to put it bluntly from the bottom line of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17353)|
| 4:49:18| I have no personal desire to serve on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17358)|
| 4:49:21| If an opening comes available in the fourth district, I plan to nominate Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17361)|
| 4:49:26| I think he'd do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17366)|
| 4:49:27| He's got more background in that than myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17367)|
| 4:49:30| And I don't know how the people in the seventh district, Commissioner Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17370)|
| 4:49:34| Smith, Phil, or the people in the first district, that's the other two that I have earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17374)|
| 4:49:40| people that were formerly commissioners serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17380)|
| 4:49:42| And I have no personal problem with the three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17382)|
| 4:49:45| They're very fine individuals and I'll serve on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17385)|
| 4:49:48| They're no longer commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17388)|
| 4:49:49| I thank them for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17389)|
| 4:49:51| In the case of Ms. Jordan, it was many, many years of service in Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17391)|
| 4:49:57| I thank Mr. Moore for his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17397)|
| 4:50:00| And it's nothing personal against those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17400)|
| 4:50:03| They're very fine citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17403)|
| 4:50:04| Nor Mr. Daniels, who is my representative on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17404)|
| 4:50:08| I just think it's inconsistent, and we need to either make it like the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17408)|
| 4:50:14| that it is all citizens, or that it's all commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17414)|
| 4:50:18| like the beer board or retirement board or these other committees that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17418)|
| 4:50:23| It's not a super important issue that you ask ten people out on Gay Street tomorrow afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17423)|
| 4:50:33| nine of them will know what the BZA is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17433)|
| 4:50:36| But the ones that do, it will matter to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17436)|
| 4:50:39| And I assure you, if you poll my district, the people that know what BZA is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17439)|
| 4:50:44| they want, by about a 90 plus percent, they say, I think it should be you or Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17444)|
| 4:50:50| And if we leave, when we leave, I shouldn't say if, when we leave, it should be one of the new commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17450)|
| 4:50:57| I know it's not universal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17457)|
| 4:50:59| I know there are people that feel strongly one way or another among my colleagues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17459)|
| 4:51:04| and I respect that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17464)|
| 4:51:06| And I just want to hear some feedback from the law director on his direction on how it can be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17466)|
| 4:51:15| not necessarily if it should be changed, but how, if it can be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17475)|
| 4:51:19| where it becomes sitting members of commission sitting on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17479)|
| 4:51:28| In addressing this issue, the threshold issue that we were asked to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17488)|
| 4:51:33| was how the law requires that BZA be constituted as far as qualifications of members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17493)|
| 4:51:42| And if someone is qualified when they take a seat on BZA and then they, for example, commission membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17502)|
| 4:51:54| and then they later cease to be a member of commission, what, if anything, is the legal result of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17514)|
| 4:52:04| In beginning that task, I was asked to look at some other things in some of the committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17524)|
| 4:52:11| and by other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17531)|
| 4:52:13| And so we broadened the scope, really, of looking at what state law requires and allows as regards BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17533)|
| 4:52:24| and what our ordinances provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17544)|
| 4:52:32| To state the obvious, the state law, the TCA, provides that the county legislative body, this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17552)|
| 4:52:40| shall create a county zoning board of appeals, which you have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17560)|
| 4:52:44| The section further provides that the county legislative body shall be the appointing power of the members of such board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17564)|
| 4:52:52| and may fix their compensation in terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17572)|
| 4:52:56| It doesn't say anything or make any requirements about whether or not the membership of the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17576)|
| 4:53:02| be members of the appointing body, nor does it require anything about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17582)|
| 4:53:11| but it does require that the members be arranged in such a way that at least one membership expire each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17591)|
| 4:53:27| and that no member's term is longer than five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17607)|
| 4:53:34| That poses a problem for us in that our ordinance is in Appendix A, the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17614)|
| 4:53:45| which is the appendix to the code, Section 6.60 is captioned, Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17625)|
| 4:53:55| Section 6.60.01 says, the establishment of a Board of Zoning Appeals to be known as the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17635)|
| 4:54:04| and hereafter referred to by the word board is hereby authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17644)|
| 4:54:08| Such board shall consist of nine members appointed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17648)|
| 4:54:14| The members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall occupy seats here and after denominated as one through nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17654)|
| 4:54:23| The term of seat one shall expire on September 1st, 1993| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17663)|
| 4:54:28| and shall be refilled by act of the Knox County Commission during its regular September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17668)|
| 4:54:35| Each successive September 1st, the term of the next numbered seat shall expire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17675)|
| 4:54:40| and be filled by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17680)|
| 4:54:45| Currently there are, I believe, three members who have been on the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17685)|
| 4:54:55| far in excess of the five year limitation under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17695)|
| 4:55:01| So there's an issue that we have that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17701)|
| 4:55:07| As far as conditioning membership on the BZA on commission membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17707)|
| 4:55:14| that's totally up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17714)|
| 4:55:17| You have the flexibility to do that if you think it's wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17717)|
| 4:55:21| You have the flexibility to make it a citizen board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17721)|
| 4:55:25| You have the flexibility to make it mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17725)|
| 4:55:28| That's up to you, keeping in mind that the maximum number of members you can have is nine under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17728)|
| 4:55:37| So if you're seeking to have membership from each commission district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17737)|
| 4:55:47| just keep in mind there's nine total members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17747)|
| 4:55:51| Mr. Law Director, does the fact that we are charter county mean that we have to still adhere to the nine maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17751)|
| 4:55:58| or does that add a complication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17758)|
| 4:56:02| I don't think it adds a complication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17762)|
| 4:56:04| I think the Board of Zoning Appeals is a creature of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17764)|
| 4:56:08| In fact, it specifically says in the statute that charter counties can have five, seven, or nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17768)|
| 4:56:17| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17777)|
| 4:56:18| I'm glad you cleared that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17778)|
| 4:56:19| The other thing you said, there are at least three members who have served in excess of the five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17779)|
| 4:56:26| Could you name those three, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17786)|
| 4:56:30| I believe they are Commissioners Jordan, Harmon, and Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17790)|
| 4:56:36| That would be Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17796)|
| 4:56:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17797)|
| 4:56:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17798)|
| 4:56:39| And the other matter is, so if they're in excess of the five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17799)|
| 4:56:43| and there hasn't been a vote to reappoint them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17803)|
| 4:56:48| There has been a vote to reappoint them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17808)|
| 4:56:50| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17810)|
| 4:56:51| But they can't serve beyond five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17811)|
| 4:56:54| Well, term limited Commissioners couldn't serve longer than their term limits, but they were elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17814)|
| 4:57:01| So the Supreme Court said they were de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17821)|
| 4:57:04| And I believe that's really what we have in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17824)|
| 4:57:07| I think our Board of Zoning Appeals is de facto and not just as to those three members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17827)|
| 4:57:14| because I don't think that any of the members, when they were appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17834)|
| 4:57:20| were appointed under our own ordinance in terms of being assigned a seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17840)|
| 4:57:28| or was it specified when they would roll off in terms of being staggered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17848)|
| 4:57:35| So we forgot to do the staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17855)|
| 4:57:37| Not only did you forget to do the staggering, but if there's nine members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17857)|
| 4:57:43| and the maximum they can serve is five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17863)|
| 4:57:46| and the ordinance says that there's this appointment process of nine up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17866)|
| 4:57:52| and one rolls off each year, then you've got four who, under the terms of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17872)|
| 4:57:57| are going to end up serving longer than five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17877)|
| 4:58:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17880)|
| 4:58:01| So there's a statutory flaw as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17881)|
| 4:58:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17882)|
| 4:58:04| Could we correct that by vote or action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17884)|
| 4:58:08| Could we make a motion here to reappoint the entire BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17888)|
| 4:58:13| and specifically declare it new and through our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17893)|
| 4:58:20| appoint only elected, seated, current commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17900)|
| 4:58:25| You could do that, but you would still have the ordinance to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17905)|
| 4:58:35| And I think that really what needs to happen is rather than you have a de facto BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17915)|
| 4:58:46| I think it would be prudent for the Intergovernmental Committee to look at this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17926)|
| 4:58:53| and bring a solution that looks at this globally back to the commission to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17933)|
| 4:59:01| rather than try to do something tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17941)|
| 4:59:06| We need to put some thought into it in order to correct these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17946)|
| 4:59:16| Should I make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17956)|
| 4:59:19| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17959)|
| 4:59:22| I didn't know if you wanted a second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17962)|
| 4:59:26| But let me, I guess, address a different aspect than Commissioner Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17966)|
| 4:59:33| and it's really kind of dealing with the discussion flavor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17973)|
| 4:59:37| and that's I tend to disagree with Commissioner Shouse in that I like having citizens participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17977)|
| 4:59:49| I like having active, engaged citizens, be they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17989)|
| 4:59:53| we can argue about whether they're former commissioners or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17993)|
| 4:59:56| But, you know, I do think it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17996)|
| 4:59:58| Some may disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17998)|
| 4:59:59| I think it works with the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=17999)|
| 5:00:03| I think having the citizenry interact and mingle with sitting commissioners, I think, is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18003)|
| 5:00:12| So I just kind of wanted to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18012)|
| 5:00:14| Even if we do away with the present ones per term limits or per the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18014)|
| 5:00:23| I do not want just nine commissioners sitting on a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18023)|
| 5:00:29| and I mean, of course, to be perfectly blunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18029)|
| 5:00:32| and I voiced this at my first commission committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18032)|
| 5:00:36| our committees aren't very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18036)|
| 5:00:39| We just kind of discuss it a while the week before and then re-discuss it on the fourth Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18039)|
| 5:00:46| and I think that's what this, you know, committee might stagger into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18046)|
| 5:00:52| I just think it's good to have fresh voices, maybe not as experienced voices, but I like that mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18052)|
| 5:01:01| William.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18061)|
| 5:01:03| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18063)|
| 5:01:04| Commissioners, good to see all of you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18064)|
| 5:01:08| I wanted to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18068)|
| 5:01:10| Obviously I am serving in the capacity on BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18070)|
| 5:01:15| and as those of you who were on commission at the time when I was seated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18075)|
| 5:01:21| I had asked not to be appointed to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18081)|
| 5:01:24| and I had mentioned the fact that I was a builder, that I was a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18084)|
| 5:01:29| and that I was a real estate agent, and I felt that that would actually hurt me being one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18089)|
| 5:01:36| and several members of the commission said, no, no, no, we need people with that type of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18096)|
| 5:01:42| And after having served on the BZA, there's several things that I've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18102)|
| 5:01:49| One is that the folks who serve on BZA, they could, I'm not saying it's used for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18109)|
| 5:01:55| but it's obviously a position that can be used for political gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18115)|
| 5:02:01| Obviously you're dealing with a lot of developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18121)|
| 5:02:04| All you have to do is look at the financial statements and contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18124)|
| 5:02:07| and the majority of the contributions in this community come from developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18127)|
| 5:02:11| or people in the construction industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18131)|
| 5:02:14| That's not unlike it is across the country, so that should come as no great surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18134)|
| 5:02:21| The other thing is that this is the last opportunity for citizens in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18141)|
| 5:02:27| to have an appeal process without going to court, and it costs them money out of their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18147)|
| 5:02:33| And I think that's extremely critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18153)|
| 5:02:36| I also think it's important to look at the history of our boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18156)|
| 5:02:39| Tonight you all have made appointments to boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18159)|
| 5:02:42| It's something that is done quite often on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18162)|
| 5:02:46| IDB is made up of no one that serves on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18166)|
| 5:02:51| Our medical boards consist of people who are not on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18171)|
| 5:02:56| And, again, we have numerous boards who have no commissioners serving on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18176)|
| 5:03:01| and I think that serves the people well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18181)|
| 5:03:06| One of the reasons that we have specialists that serve on the medical boards is because, you know, I'm not a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18186)|
| 5:03:14| I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense for me to serve on a medical board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18194)|
| 5:03:17| I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense for me necessarily to serve on the industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18197)|
| 5:03:23| I think folks who are experts in finance and in funding and in bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18203)|
| 5:03:28| those are the type of people that make great appointees to those boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18208)|
| 5:03:32| I don't think BZA should be viewed any differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18212)|
| 5:03:37| Whether this commission decides that they want me to serve or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18217)|
| 5:03:42| I'm serving because I think I bring a lot to the BZA because that is my field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18222)|
| 5:03:48| That's what I'm an expert in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18228)|
| 5:03:51| I think I ask a lot of questions because I can look at a plat and I understand where's the water going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18231)|
| 5:03:58| You know, is this going to flood someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18238)|
| 5:04:00| Is there an issue here that maybe the full commission missed when they approved something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18240)|
| 5:04:06| Or maybe MPC missed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18246)|
| 5:04:09| But I think that, and I believe that, really, BZA, we need to take the politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18249)|
| 5:04:17| As a former commissioner, I'll be happy to step down if that's the pleasure of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18257)|
| 5:04:22| I just know that I had the night of my final meeting in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18262)|
| 5:04:28| I had my resignation letter that I offered at that meeting, and I was told I'd have to wait to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18268)|
| 5:04:35| During that period of time, I had a lot of people ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18275)|
| 5:04:38| William, will you please stay on because we need that expertise on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18278)|
| 5:04:43| If that's a benefit to this community, I'll be happy to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18283)|
| 5:04:46| It takes a lot of time going around visiting these different sites where people have an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18286)|
| 5:04:52| And I do it with a lot of due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18292)|
| 5:04:56| But if it's the desire of this board to change the makeup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18296)|
| 5:05:01| I think the best thing you can do is have an all-citizen board made up of people who understand development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18301)|
| 5:05:08| real estate, construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18308)|
| 5:05:12| I think it's important to have those types of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18312)|
| 5:05:14| because we deal in issues that affect communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18314)|
| 5:05:17| We deal with issues that affect what goes in someone's backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18317)|
| 5:05:21| And I think it's important that we have people that are experts in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18321)|
| 5:05:25| not someone who just wants to gain something politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18325)|
| 5:05:29| Thank you, Chairman, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18329)|
| 5:05:31| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18331)|
| 5:05:33| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18333)|
| 5:05:34| What is the makeup of the NPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18334)|
| 5:05:37| My understanding is that there is a professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18337)|
| 5:05:41| and then you have a board that's made up of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18341)|
| 5:05:44| What is the composition of the NPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18344)|
| 5:05:51| The NPC is, like you said, the key element to the NPC is the professional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18351)|
| 5:05:57| because in terms of the members of the NPC are appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18357)|
| 5:06:02| And they can rely on the expertise of that professional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18362)|
| 5:06:07| BZA does not have a staff to assist them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18367)|
| 5:06:14| And I would point out that, again, another facet of why I think it's wise to put off doing anything tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18374)|
| 5:06:26| and study this issue is I don't know what has been done in the past in terms of the BZA membership training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18386)|
| 5:06:36| Mr. Daniels might be able to, he's shaking his head no to say it doesn't appear that there is any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18396)|
| 5:06:41| The state statute also requires that the members of BZA receive training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18401)|
| 5:06:52| a certain number of hours of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18412)|
| 5:06:55| because it contemplates that the issues that the members of a board of zoning and appeals will face are very technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18415)|
| 5:07:05| Issues that require a certain level of competence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18425)|
| 5:07:09| So I mention that just so you can factor that into your consideration of what you do this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18429)|
| 5:07:18| So what we have, what the process entails is that we have a professional staff at the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18438)|
| 5:07:27| and then they make their recommendations to the board who are appointed citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18447)|
| 5:07:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18455)|
| 5:07:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18456)|
| 5:07:37| I guess I'm trying to look at this as where you're trying to balance between professional people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18457)|
| 5:07:44| citizens that are appointed, and then ultimately you have the BZA, which is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18464)|
| 5:07:50| it's not really the court of final appeal, but it's the final one before you get into the actual judiciary system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18470)|
| 5:07:57| But it would seem to me that you're balancing citizens' interest with expertise on the NPC with their appointed staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18477)|
| 5:08:05| versus having a BZA where you have elected officials that are representing the wishes of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18485)|
| 5:08:15| And if you give them the training that they need to make that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18495)|
| 5:08:18| you have the balance on the NPC with the appointed people with expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18498)|
| 5:08:21| versus elected officials who make the final determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18501)|
| 5:08:26| rather than just having two groups of people who are more or less would have the same expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18506)|
| 5:08:31| and may have the same point of view in that they're not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18511)|
| 5:08:34| And I'm just making that as a comment, not as a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18514)|
| 5:08:40| I can't speak to the motives that prompted commission in the past to appoint from among its members the members of BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18520)|
| 5:08:55| I can, and there may be some here who are familiar with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18535)|
| 5:08:59| but I can at least speak to the fact that we know that zoning is an issue that falls to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18539)|
| 5:09:09| So that seems to be the difference between NPC and BZA and this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18549)|
| 5:09:22| in that county commission is the final arbiter of matters involving zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18562)|
| 5:09:28| BZA reviews issues of limited jurisdiction, but it still involves zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18568)|
| 5:09:35| And I assume that that's the reason that in the past members of commission have constituted BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18575)|
| 5:09:43| Someone else may be able to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18583)|
| 5:09:50| Chairman, if I might, I should have given my name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18590)|
| 5:09:55| William Daniels, 1505 Botsford Drive, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18595)|
| 5:10:02| The other point I would make, Mr. Law Director, is that it appears shortly we are going to go from 19 commission members to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18602)|
| 5:10:12| At that point in time, each one of the city, if it stays the way or if it goes to elected commissioners serving on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18612)|
| 5:10:20| you would go to where all nine of the two at large would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18620)|
| 5:10:25| but more than likely one from each district would serve on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18625)|
| 5:10:30| So basically the BZA would be the commission minus the two at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18630)|
| 5:10:37| which they're going to vote one night, turn around a few days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18637)|
| 5:10:42| and be hearing appeals at BZA, which they've already voted on, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18642)|
| 5:10:49| There's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18649)|
| 5:10:51| It's a system of checks and balances, which I really believe BZA was supposed to be a system of checks and balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18651)|
| 5:10:58| to make sure that the community had an opportunity to be heard in an appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18658)|
| 5:11:06| Because obviously you don't get a judgment from a judge today and turn around and go back to the same judge and appeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18666)|
| 5:11:12| You're going to go to an appellate judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18672)|
| 5:11:17| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18677)|
| 5:11:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18678)|
| 5:11:19| I serve on BZA, and I want to say that politics is used as a word in a perjurative sense, and it shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18679)|
| 5:11:28| This is a place where the elected officials of the county can give some expression on what they believe the proper approach to zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18688)|
| 5:11:35| in particular cases, is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18695)|
| 5:11:38| And we get appeals from all sorts of places, and it is a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18698)|
| 5:11:43| We must build a good record, and because it could be appealed in the Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18703)|
| 5:11:48| I don't think the training point, although interesting, precludes anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18708)|
| 5:11:52| CTAS is a very good organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18712)|
| 5:11:54| It can quickly arrange any training that might be needed for any commissioner or anyone else to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18714)|
| 5:12:00| But I think in the long run we are not served well by a board that is neither fish nor fowl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18720)|
| 5:12:05| that is sort of half legacy commissioners and part currently serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18725)|
| 5:12:11| I think we'd be better served with one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18731)|
| 5:12:14| And I prefer one spot in the process where definitely elected officials make a say, and that's what I'd like to see us go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18734)|
| 5:12:23| I think that just simply works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18743)|
| 5:12:26| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18746)|
| 5:12:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18748)|
| 5:12:29| A couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18749)|
| 5:12:30| You had mentioned, Mr. Law Director, that you did not think that the BZA people were appointed with specific seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18750)|
| 5:12:36| When I was appointed, I was appointed as the District 5 representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18756)|
| 5:12:40| so I would assume that that would be seat number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18760)|
| 5:12:43| Well, I don't know what that may have been spoken, but as far as the official records are concerned, it's nowhere reflected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18763)|
| 5:12:54| When were you first appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18774)|
| 5:12:57| It's been about four years ago, so I guess I'm coming up on my fifth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18777)|
| 5:13:00| But it's my understanding that when we voted, it was understood that the BZA, because when I was elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18780)|
| 5:13:06| I was selected by the chair at the time as the fifth district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18786)|
| 5:13:12| And it was stated that whether or not it's probably on the tapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18792)|
| 5:13:15| If it's not in the written record, it should be on the tapes, because I remember it well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18795)|
| 5:13:19| because I remember Mr. Leuthold and I had the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18799)|
| 5:13:22| He couldn't do it and Mr. Grease couldn't do it, so it kind of fell to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18802)|
| 5:13:25| I assumed that that was done by custom, as you just said, but the minutes do not reflect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18805)|
| 5:13:35| and no resolution reflects it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18815)|
| 5:13:38| If it's on the tapes, it's on the tapes, but it's not in the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18818)|
| 5:13:43| Has Mr. Monsier filed a suit against the BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18823)|
| 5:13:46| He's filed two suits, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18826)|
| 5:13:49| And would you tell us what those are, because I'd heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18829)|
| 5:13:51| and I wanted to make sure I understood what he's filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18831)|
| 5:13:54| He's challenging various aspects of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18834)|
| 5:14:00| The one that is most pertinent, I guess, to our discussion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18840)|
| 5:14:06| is that he is alleging that members of the commission cannot serve on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18846)|
| 5:14:17| And he's relying on state statute, a provision in the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18857)|
| 5:14:23| both of which the courts have repeatedly held only apply to state officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18863)|
| 5:14:30| The courts have held that it does not apply to local officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18870)|
| 5:14:35| The last thing that he's trying to hang his hat on is a provision that, in my opinion, does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18875)|
| 5:14:47| Was that the oath thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18887)|
| 5:14:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18889)|
| 5:14:50| So because we as BZA commissioners did not take oaths, we should be kicked off of BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18890)|
| 5:14:57| or out of our commission seats or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18897)|
| 5:14:59| I wasn't quite clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18899)|
| 5:15:00| He's trying to, it appears to me, to back people into a corner so that they have to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18900)|
| 5:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18906)|
| 5:15:07| I hope it wasn't automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18907)|
| 5:15:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18910)|
| 5:15:11| My final question is that you've, I hate to bring this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18911)|
| 5:15:15| but I know that people who are out there have already thought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18915)|
| 5:15:18| You said we are a de facto BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18918)|
| 5:15:21| That does not affect any of the past actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18921)|
| 5:15:25| Just like the court said that de facto decisions of the commission could not be undone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18925)|
| 5:15:34| But going forward, if the feeling is that we now know we are de facto and we meet Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18934)|
| 5:15:41| are any actions that we take Wednesday suspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18941)|
| 5:15:45| This commission operated on a de facto basis for a long time before things were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18945)|
| 5:15:55| Our whole charter is still de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18955)|
| 5:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18957)|
| 5:15:58| So you're comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18958)|
| 5:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18959)|
| 5:16:00| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18960)|
| 5:16:01| So there seems to be a kind of a sense of urgency here that the Intergovernmental Committee come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18961)|
| 5:16:04| and let's clean this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18964)|
| 5:16:05| So I'm all in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18965)|
| 5:16:06| Do we have a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18966)|
| 5:16:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18968)|
| 5:16:09| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18969)|
| 5:16:11| I'll take a motion then that the Intergovernmental Committee be instructed to meet with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18971)|
| 5:16:15| and present us with the language we need to reflect BZA improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18975)|
| 5:16:21| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18981)|
| 5:16:22| I've got a motion properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18982)|
| 5:16:25| Thank you, commissioners, for considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18985)|
| 5:16:27| I just thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18987)|
| 5:16:29| I don't have the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18989)|
| 5:16:30| I just want to look at it and get some focus, some attention on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18990)|
| 5:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18993)|
| 5:16:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18994)|
| 5:16:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18996)|
| 5:16:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18997)|
| 5:16:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=18998)|
| 5:16:42| Discussion of length of ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19002)|
| 5:16:51| This one's deferred, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19011)|
| 5:16:53| Discussion of length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19013)|
| 5:16:55| I think Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19015)|

| 5:17:11| Someone from finance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19031)|
| 5:17:13| Move the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19033)|
| 5:17:14| No action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19034)|
| 5:17:15| Here he comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19035)|

| 5:17:32| Just as a housekeeping matter on the item before dealing with the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19052)|
| 5:17:38| there's actually one thing, the appointment of Mary Kaiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19058)|
| 5:17:43| Don't we need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19063)|
| 5:17:46| The second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19066)|
| 5:17:48| That's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19068)|
| 5:17:49| Oh, it has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19069)|
| 5:17:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19070)|
| 5:17:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19072)|
| 5:17:54| As we talked about at the finance and intergovernmental committee, the joint meeting we had Tuesday week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19074)|
| 5:18:06| next November we will begin to be able to pick up petitions to run for the next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19086)|
| 5:18:12| and that will be here before we all know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19092)|
| 5:18:16| Since the voters have chosen to reduce the size of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19096)|
| 5:18:23| and obviously one district, the fifth district, has a greater population than the rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19103)|
| 5:18:28| some sort of redistricting must be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19108)|
| 5:18:31| As I've stated before, I have spoken to Bruce Ralston at UT, the UT Geography Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19111)|
| 5:18:37| and I believe our law director has spoken to the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19117)|
| 5:18:40| But regardless of that, I'm told by Greg McKay that we must go through Darren Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19120)|
| 5:18:50| who works for the Comptroller of the Treasury in Tennessee, Tennessee State Comptroller of the Treasury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19130)|
| 5:18:59| He has the GIS information and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19139)|
| 5:19:02| So what I want to do is just get something going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19142)|
| 5:19:05| I don't want to wait until midsummer and then scramble around and try to figure out what the districts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19145)|
| 5:19:10| There has been a suggestion that perhaps we adopt the school districts, and perhaps that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19150)|
| 5:19:17| But I'm told that information needs to be more current than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19157)|
| 5:19:21| and I believe the law director would like if you would weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19161)|
| 5:19:25| Well, the reason I brought this issue up back in November was for the commission to look at it, just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19165)|
| 5:19:36| just to examine it and see what, if anything, needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19176)|
| 5:19:42| We're putting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19182)|
| 5:19:44| What I would like to see happen, and again, it's up to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19184)|
| 5:19:51| but I would strongly advise at the least to have a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19191)|
| 5:20:00| And I'm not saying that you don't even have to empower that committee to make recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19200)|
| 5:20:05| but to come back and report to this body whether you even think there's a need to redistrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19205)|
| 5:20:12| The only reason, and suggestions have been made, well, let's use the school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19212)|
| 5:20:18| Perhaps that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19218)|
| 5:20:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19220)|
| 5:20:22| But because of the length of time that has passed since those districts were created based on the 2000 census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19222)|
| 5:20:30| and we're voting in 2010, we don't know if that, those districts will be representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19230)|
| 5:20:39| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19239)|
| 5:20:42| And, you know, let's have, let's just take a step back and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19242)|
| 5:20:48| and make a determination whether or not we need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19248)|
| 5:20:54| Then let me see if I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19254)|
| 5:20:56| You're not suggesting that there be a committee of this body, but a separate committee of disinterested third parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19256)|
| 5:21:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19263)|
| 5:21:04| I'm not making any suggestion about how the committee should be constituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19264)|
| 5:21:09| I think, you know, members of this body should be on it, but I'm not saying that it should be, you know, just this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19269)|
| 5:21:17| I think, you know, unless someone here can say that they feel they have possessed the expertise to look at the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19277)|
| 5:21:27| as they're currently constituted and come back and report you'll be on safe ground, leaving it as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19287)|
| 5:21:35| or adopting the school districts for 2010, then we need to get some outside assistance to offer suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19295)|
| 5:21:45| And, again, I've used this phrase tonight, the threshold question is, do we need to do anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19305)|
| 5:21:55| And then if the answer to that question is yes, then it's going to take more study to determine what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19315)|
| 5:22:06| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19326)|
| 5:22:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19328)|
| 5:22:09| I would concur with our law director and Mr. Saunders that we need to start taking some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19329)|
| 5:22:14| We're looking at in ten months people will begin picking up petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19334)|
| 5:22:19| But the process has got to go before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19339)|
| 5:22:21| And I know that there have been lawsuits filed against the legality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19341)|
| 5:22:24| but the basic premise we're going on right now is the voters have voted to reduce the size of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19344)|
| 5:22:31| And we know that there is a possibility that there may need to be some redistricting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19351)|
| 5:22:37| And it's going to take another month or so before we can get a report in, or maybe even longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19357)|
| 5:22:41| So then you're shortening the time even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19361)|
| 5:22:43| But people need to know what district they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19363)|
| 5:22:45| They need to know if, indeed, if they're going to run for the 5th District, do they live in the 5th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19365)|
| 5:22:50| Or if it's going to be redrawn, will they be in the 4th District or the 6th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19370)|
| 5:22:53| I mean, people need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19373)|
| 5:22:55| And so I would be in favor of going ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19375)|
| 5:22:58| and asking our chairman to appoint a committee that would be made up of a couple of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19378)|
| 5:23:04| Mr. Bruce Ralston, I'm not familiar with him, but I think he would be an excellent choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19384)|
| 5:23:08| maybe the head of our GIS department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19388)|
| 5:23:11| I would throw out the name of Frank Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19391)|
| 5:23:14| Mr. Luthold has done extensive work in looking at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19394)|
| 5:23:18| If you feel he would not be available to do it, or perhaps maybe he would be too politically inclined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19398)|
| 5:23:25| then maybe we throw his name out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19405)|
| 5:23:26| I just throw that up as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19406)|
| 5:23:28| But I believe that we need to have three to five people that would be selected by our chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19408)|
| 5:23:33| and if you need to bring it back to us for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19413)|
| 5:23:35| But I think we need to start looking at some names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19415)|
| 5:23:37| And I really think we need to get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19417)|
| 5:23:39| And then if the courts throw it out, they throw it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19419)|
| 5:23:41| But if they don't, at least we're ahead of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19421)|
| 5:23:43| and people need to start knowing what district they're in and how those districts are going to be drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19423)|
| 5:23:51| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19431)|
| 5:23:52| I agree completely with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19432)|
| 5:23:56| In my opinion, I think we have to do something because of the situation in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19436)|
| 5:24:02| I mean, we have 20,000 more people, I believe, than any other district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19442)|
| 5:24:07| I just don't see how you can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19447)|
| 5:24:09| I think somebody is going to be disenfranchised, and I think they would have a very legitimate complaint, it seems to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19449)|
| 5:24:15| that they weren't being adequately represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19455)|
| 5:24:21| And what you say is absolutely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19461)|
| 5:24:24| I'd like to know where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19464)|
| 5:24:31| Do you need help getting home this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19471)|
| 5:24:36| You don't live too far from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19476)|
| 5:24:37| I'll give you a ride home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19477)|
| 5:24:38| I'll get the former gentleman to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19478)|
| 5:24:42| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19482)|
| 5:24:44| I agree that we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19484)|
| 5:24:47| But the only way to handle this is if we make this commission the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19487)|
| 5:24:53| You know, it's going to be a politicized process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19493)|
| 5:24:56| It can't be anything but a politicized process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19496)|
| 5:25:00| I mean, let's not kid ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19500)|
| 5:25:02| And the people that say it's not going to be a politicized process, they know it's going to be a politicized process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19502)|
| 5:25:11| If you have a ‑‑ if I get on the committee and Mark Harmon doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19511)|
| 5:25:16| I'm going to try to draw districts that are favorable to conservative Republicans, both, conservative and Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19516)|
| 5:25:24| If he gets on the committee, and I don't, I'm just picking on you because your light's on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19524)|
| 5:25:28| and we enjoy arguing with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19528)|
| 5:25:31| But if he gets on it and I don't, he's going to be in favor of districts that favor liberal Democrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19531)|
| 5:25:41| We have seen the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19541)|
| 5:25:43| I'm going to find both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19543)|
| 5:25:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19544)|
| 5:25:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19545)|
| 5:25:46| There's a few here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19546)|
| 5:25:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19547)|
| 5:25:48| Well, I mean, we'll take your state house district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19548)|
| 5:25:53| The house district that you live in, Mr. Harmon, was gerrymandered by the Democratic Party in Nashville to be one that was favorable to Mr. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19553)|
| 5:26:03| Now, I like Mr. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19563)|
| 5:26:04| I served with his father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19564)|
| 5:26:06| But there is no doubt that since the Democrats have controlled redistricting for so long in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19566)|
| 5:26:15| you can go throughout Tennessee and see that there's been gerrymandering going on to make favorably liberal Democrat districts in what are otherwise pretty conservative Republican areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19575)|
| 5:26:31| And I assume that the Republican Party is going to do exactly the same thing when we fully take control of the state house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19591)|
| 5:26:41| It's just politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19601)|
| 5:26:42| That's the way it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19602)|
| 5:26:43| The only thing that will make it fair is if everybody on this body is involved in redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19603)|
| 5:26:52| If not, somebody is going to see a way to take advantage to make a new commission that's going to be a little more favorable to the ideology that they adhere to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19612)|
| 5:27:03| And that's just human nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19623)|
| 5:27:04| And the only way to be fair, that's going to be a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19624)|
| 5:27:08| There's going to be lots of debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19628)|
| 5:27:11| And I'm sure it will be fun for folks at home to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19631)|
| 5:27:14| I think our ratings have gone up considerably since myself and Mr. Harmon have been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19634)|
| 5:27:20| But the thing is, is that we've got to take our time and we've got to do it right because there is so much potential for unfairness here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19640)|
| 5:27:29| that the only fair thing to do is to give everybody a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19649)|
| 5:27:33| I think we're going to draw this Olympians up in Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19653)|
| 5:27:37| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19657)|
| 5:27:39| I think I'd do pretty well there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19659)|
| 5:27:41| I'd like to go next because I was referenced personally, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19661)|
| 5:27:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19665)|
| 5:27:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19666)|
| 5:27:48| I've actually done academic research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19668)|
| 5:27:50| It's in one of those university twit journals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19670)|
| 5:27:54| And granted, gerrymandering occurs and it occurs at all levels and by both parties and any parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19674)|
| 5:28:01| But I think the point I want to make is that maybe the most disinterested thing is to look seriously at the school board districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19681)|
| 5:28:08| because they were balanced at the time they were created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19688)|
| 5:28:12| They met court challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19692)|
| 5:28:14| All I'd ask the law director is to look into the legal history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19694)|
| 5:28:17| Has there ever been a successful sort of mid-census challenge because of population shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19697)|
| 5:28:25| or a political oddity such as the one we're facing that was successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19705)|
| 5:28:29| And if there hasn't been, then maybe we should look seriously at using the existing school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19709)|
| 5:28:36| There has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19716)|
| 5:28:38| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19718)|
| 5:28:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19719)|
| 5:28:40| And if you read one of the most famous cases involving the principle of one man, one vote arose from Tennessee, Baker versus Carr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19720)|
| 5:28:52| And that's what we have to achieve in attempting to align the districts in the proper representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19732)|
| 5:28:58| But the point I'd like to make is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19738)|
| 5:29:01| I think Baker versus Carr said they were false from the start, that they didn't change and become bad districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19741)|
| 5:29:10| But keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19750)|
| 5:29:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19751)|
| 5:29:12| My point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19752)|
| 5:29:13| In light of what Commissioner Lambert stated, he was saying it's going to be politicized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19753)|
| 5:29:20| Well, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19760)|
| 5:29:22| But this is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19762)|
| 5:29:24| Gerrymandering comes about because if there's an effort to make, as Commissioner Lambert alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19764)|
| 5:29:34| a particular district more favorable to one party or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19774)|
| 5:29:39| but still those who perform the gerrymandering have to have at their side experts who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19779)|
| 5:29:46| okay, if we draw it this way, is the representation legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19786)|
| 5:29:51| That's why you have districts that stretch from Chattanooga to Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19791)|
| 5:29:58| Because in order to achieve that proper representation and then get the political aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19798)|
| 5:30:04| you've still got to have the expert who tells you that the district is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19804)|
| 5:30:08| So I don't think it would be wise to just have commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19808)|
| 5:30:16| unless someone can answer that question for me earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19816)|
| 5:30:21| which member of commission possesses the expertise to make sure that the districts are drawn properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19821)|
| 5:30:30| in order to achieve equal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19830)|
| 5:30:33| And unless some member of this commission can say that they have that expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19833)|
| 5:30:39| we need some advice from the outside at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19839)|
| 5:30:44| And it may well be, Commissioner Harmon, that the school districts work just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19844)|
| 5:30:50| But before we make that decision, let's get some comfort level with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19850)|
| 5:30:55| Demographers or someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19855)|
| 5:30:57| My three-year-old is very good with shapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19857)|
| 5:31:00| That's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19860)|
| 5:31:02| And I'm sure your three-year-old could add some viable points to the discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19862)|
| 5:31:07| Can she color within the lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19867)|
| 5:31:13| We were having some discussion that if we're going to have a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19873)|
| 5:31:18| maybe the three term limited commissioners could possibly be part of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19878)|
| 5:31:25| because we have no extra ground, we won't be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19885)|
| 5:31:28| That's myself, Commissioner Lutho, and Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19888)|
| 5:31:33| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19893)|
| 5:31:34| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19894)|
| 5:31:38| I was on the committee to redistrict the city council ten years ago, so I have done a little bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19898)|
| 5:31:49| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19909)|
| 5:31:51| I don't have a problem with the commission being the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19911)|
| 5:31:53| but I think we'd be entirely foolish if we didn't avail ourselves with some expert help that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19913)|
| 5:32:01| You've mentioned Frank Lutho, the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19921)|
| 5:32:05| UT has a department over there that has already volunteered to help us with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19925)|
| 5:32:09| So whatever committee we set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19929)|
| 5:32:11| we need to avail ourselves of some of these folks who have some of this expertise that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19931)|
| 5:32:19| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19939)|
| 5:32:21| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19941)|
| 5:32:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19942)|
| 5:32:23| You talked about your dad and for the benefit of some people that are watching from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19943)|
| 5:32:27| You're term limited out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19947)|
| 5:32:29| I'm term limited out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19949)|
| 5:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19950)|
| 5:32:31| Do people in the commission hear about your dad, what he has done in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19951)|
| 5:32:35| A lot of people do not know that, what all he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19955)|
| 5:32:38| My father has drawn the last, well, he drew the redistricting after the 1980, after the 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19958)|
| 5:32:50| and the current one that was drawn after the 2000 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19970)|
| 5:32:54| Would he be willing to help again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19974)|
| 5:32:56| He would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19976)|
| 5:32:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19977)|
| 5:33:00| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19980)|
| 5:33:04| You know, people keep mentioning the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19984)|
| 5:33:06| Now, as a conservative Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19986)|
| 5:33:08| my theory is that if the Baker Center redraws our districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19988)|
| 5:33:14| we're going to wind up with Panama getting one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19994)|
| 5:33:18| So why don't you let me contact the Heritage Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=19998)|
| 5:33:21| and see if we can get a good right-wing group to help us draw these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20001)|
| 5:33:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20008)|
| 5:33:31| You know, I'm sat and listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20011)|
| 5:33:33| I'm going to try my best not to turn on my light, but I must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20013)|
| 5:33:37| You know, in that former Commissioner Lutho,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20017)|
| 5:33:40| there's a probably pretty conservative Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20020)|
| 5:33:43| and he did, from what I'm seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20023)|
| 5:33:46| a pretty darn good job of redrawing the present districts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20026)|
| 5:33:53| So just because, and I think the law director touched on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20033)|
| 5:33:57| just because someone's ideologies might be a little more left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20037)|
| 5:34:01| or a little more right or maybe even extreme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20041)|
| 5:34:04| when it comes down to one man, one person, one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20044)|
| 5:34:08| I think the laws are fairly plain in that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20048)|
| 5:34:14| So, you know, if the Baker Center, they have the expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20054)|
| 5:34:17| whichever way they lean, they're not going to get by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20057)|
| 5:34:21| This is a fairly conservative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20061)|
| 5:34:23| They're not going to get a district, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20063)|
| 5:34:26| that ends up with ten Democrats and nine Republicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20066)|
| 5:34:29| So I think we just need to take the conversation beyond affiliations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20069)|
| 5:34:33| and let's just try to do a good job and try to reapportion this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20073)|
| 5:34:38| in terms of districts in a way that's going to serve all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20078)|
| 5:34:44| But you'll get no complaints about Mr. Lutho for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20084)|
| 5:34:47| Okay, but you've complained about everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20087)|
| 5:34:51| I don't mind there being some other people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20091)|
| 5:34:55| but I think that everybody that's sitting on this commission needs to have a seat at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20095)|
| 5:35:00| and I think that we need to be very conscious of who else we bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20100)|
| 5:35:04| Somebody like Mr. Lutho is one thing, letting a moderate, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20104)|
| 5:35:10| Having the Howard Baker Center at our backyard, at our disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20110)|
| 5:35:17| is power that other counties, other entities would die for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20117)|
| 5:35:21| and we're bashing them because it's a moderate or it's this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20121)|
| 5:35:25| I think, again, we just need to move the conversation beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20125)|
| 5:35:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20131)|
| 5:35:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20133)|
| 5:35:35| I had mentioned Frank Lutho because knowing what he has done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20135)|
| 5:35:40| I want to try a motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20140)|
| 5:35:43| Any recommendation that comes from this committee is going to have to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20143)|
| 5:35:47| I mean, we have the final say-so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20147)|
| 5:35:49| and I don't think that we all have the time to go out and start drawing and looking at figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20149)|
| 5:35:53| So let's rely on the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20153)|
| 5:35:55| I'm going to make a motion that we instruct our chairman to come up with a committee of up to five members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20155)|
| 5:36:02| to take a look at redrawing the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20162)|
| 5:36:05| And if you want him to come back to us for approval, that's fine with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20165)|
| 5:36:10| to include Frank Lutho, Mr. Ralston, who is the head, maybe a representative from the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20170)|
| 5:36:16| But, you know, let's bring in the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20176)|
| 5:36:18| Let's let them bring us a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20178)|
| 5:36:20| We can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20180)|
| 5:36:21| We can do whatever we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20181)|
| 5:36:22| But the final thing is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20182)|
| 5:36:24| I'm not as concerned about kicking out a Democrat or a Republican as I am getting it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20184)|
| 5:36:29| and making sure that we're legal and that we're not going to end up in court, in federal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20189)|
| 5:36:33| and challenging some of the people who may get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20193)|
| 5:36:37| So I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20197)|
| 5:36:39| I have a friendly amendment that we add this body to that committee, and we have a committee of experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20199)|
| 5:36:45| I'm sorry, Commissioner, I'm not going to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20205)|
| 5:36:47| We don't need a 19-member body to go along with the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20207)|
| 5:36:52| They're going to come to us and give us their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20212)|
| 5:36:54| Well, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20214)|
| 5:36:55| If we don't like it, then we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20215)|
| 5:36:56| But, I mean, do you have the time to go in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20216)|
| 5:36:58| I mean, I'm just saying 19 people trying to come in and redistrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20218)|
| 5:37:03| I think let the chairman form a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20223)|
| 5:37:06| They're going to bring it to us, and then we can take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20226)|
| 5:37:08| I'd like to second the motion as proposed by Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20228)|
| 5:37:13| What were the names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20233)|
| 5:37:15| Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20235)|
| 5:37:16| I was going to suggest to include, but, again, it's your decision, Mr. Bruce Ralston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20236)|
| 5:37:20| who's the head of the Geography Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20240)|
| 5:37:22| Bruce Ralston, along with our former Commissioner Luthold, someone from the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20242)|
| 5:37:28| And I'd like to add Lloyd Daugherty to that list of the Tennessee Conservative Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20248)|
| 5:37:37| Yeah, I mean, we have a motion on the floor and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20257)|
| 5:37:43| Does that include your term limited commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20263)|
| 5:37:48| Well, he told me to come up with some names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20268)|
| 5:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20271)|
| 5:37:52| I'd like to have you guys on there, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20272)|
| 5:37:58| I would just like to say I agree with what Commissioner Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20278)|
| 5:38:03| I hope we will leave it to this committee or this task force to use resources that are available in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20283)|
| 5:38:11| to include those ones mentioned, but perhaps MPC and several other entities that can be of some help to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20291)|
| 5:38:22| Commissioner Luthold, would you like to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20302)|
| 5:38:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20306)|
| 5:38:28| I do agree with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20308)|
| 5:38:30| I think a committee of commissioners would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20310)|
| 5:38:38| I don't know that we necessarily need to have experts on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20318)|
| 5:38:42| I think it should just be made up of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20322)|
| 5:38:46| They can go out, allow that committee to go out and go to these experts to use them to help them form this new map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20326)|
| 5:38:59| and then allow them to work with them, is what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20339)|
| 5:39:06| is let this committee of commissioners work with the experts and then bring that product back to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20346)|
| 5:39:13| And obviously every meeting will be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20353)|
| 5:39:18| and every commissioner will be allowed to come along with the public to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20358)|
| 5:39:24| And you will have your input at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20364)|
| 5:39:27| Being allowed to speak at a meeting and being allowed to vote on a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20367)|
| 5:39:31| something as important as redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20371)|
| 5:39:35| And I'm sure that, you know, like I said, if your father's on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20375)|
| 5:39:38| that you'll be real happy with the amount of voice that you'll have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20378)|
| 5:39:42| but quite frankly I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20382)|
| 5:39:44| I think that we all deserve a seat at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20384)|
| 5:39:48| and I think that there's too much potential for gerrymandering here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20388)|
| 5:39:52| and I'm not going to go along with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20392)|
| 5:39:55| And I'm sure there's enough votes out there to outvote me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20395)|
| 5:39:58| but I just want the public to see exactly what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20398)|
| 5:40:03| You can control any election possible if you can control the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20403)|
| 5:40:09| You can draw districts in such a way that a Paul Pinkston or a Lumpy Lambert can't get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20409)|
| 5:40:15| I could draw districts in such a way that Commissioner Harmon wouldn't have a chance at getting elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20415)|
| 5:40:22| You know, that is where the battlefield of politics is done, is when it comes to redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20422)|
| 5:40:29| And I'm not going to sit here and be quiet because it's late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20429)|
| 5:40:32| and because everybody wants to go home and I know everybody's tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20432)|
| 5:40:36| and everybody's saying, oh, let's just push this off to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20436)|
| 5:40:39| Well, let me tell you, that somebody else is going to have a tremendous amount of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20439)|
| 5:40:44| They are going to have the power to determine the political makeup of this county through districting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20444)|
| 5:40:50| And I think that you're going to pass this, but I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20450)|
| 5:40:54| I think we're being lazy, and I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20454)|
| 5:40:57| I think that some folks on this commission want a more top-up controlled situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20457)|
| 5:41:04| where we appoint a few people, probably the same people that get appointed to a lot of committees in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20464)|
| 5:41:10| And I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20470)|
| 5:41:11| This is probably one of the most important decisions we will make this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20471)|
| 5:41:16| and I think that us passing it off on somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20476)|
| 5:41:19| and keeping commissioners from having a seat at the table is wrong, and I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20479)|
| 5:41:26| Commissioner Lambert, I appreciate your views, and I believe I still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20486)|
| 5:41:33| In response to you, Mr. Lambert, I'm not running in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20493)|
| 5:41:40| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20500)|
| 5:41:41| I'm term limited out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20501)|
| 5:41:42| And so what voice I happen to have or what district I end up in makes no difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20502)|
| 5:41:49| So I don't have a dog in this race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20509)|
| 5:41:54| But I do think the committee should be made up of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20514)|
| 5:41:58| and then let that committee go out and get the expertise that they feel that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20518)|
| 5:42:05| in order to bring back a good legal redistricting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20525)|
| 5:42:11| When you say it needs to be made up of commissioners, why do you want to exclude commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20531)|
| 5:42:16| Commissioner Lambert, if you want to keep your light on, I'll recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20536)|
| 5:42:20| Mr. Chairman, in a way I agree with Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20540)|
| 5:42:23| If we're not careful, the west end of this town could have seven votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20543)|
| 5:42:31| We could be without any minority representation at all on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20551)|
| 5:42:35| That's the only thing I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20555)|
| 5:42:38| I think probably we should have one person in every district representing us with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20558)|
| 5:42:46| That would be nine off of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20566)|
| 5:42:48| I'm not concerned about the Republican and Democrat part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20568)|
| 5:42:51| I just want to see that the people in South Knoxville and the minorities are represented, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20571)|
| 5:42:56| And if we're not careful, like I say, the west end could have seven of these commissioners out of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20576)|
| 5:43:05| And that's dangerous, in my opinion, to give any one side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20585)|
| 5:43:09| Now, I'm not trying to start warfare between the districts or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20589)|
| 5:43:13| but I certainly want my district, the people in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20593)|
| 5:43:18| which has sort of been like a red-headed stepchild for years, to be treated fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20598)|
| 5:43:23| And I just feel like we do need to have a commissioner for every district on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20603)|
| 5:43:32| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20612)|
| 5:43:34| I agree with a lot of what Mr. Pinkston said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20614)|
| 5:43:37| but one thing I do disagree with is that we should pick one commissioner from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20617)|
| 5:43:43| I think that it should be all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20623)|
| 5:43:45| You put me on that, and I have some say in how the district is drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20625)|
| 5:43:50| Me and my seatmate, Mr. Anders, have a little bit different constituency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20630)|
| 5:43:56| The new sixth district could be drawn in such a way that it favors myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=20636)|
