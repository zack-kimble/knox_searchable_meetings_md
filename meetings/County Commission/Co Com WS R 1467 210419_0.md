| 0:02:50| Any other thoughts on the layout for the evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=170)|

| 0:03:48| I took out, if you have your notes from earlier, I took out two of those that I had asked to be pulled and did not ask for them to be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=228)|
| 0:04:00| There was 20 and 35. So if you want 20 and 35 pulled, then you should ask now, but I took that off of my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=240)|

| 0:09:46| I want to thank the board last month for basically washing the dog and get rid of the fleas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| The reality out there is we still have a bit of a problem. The problem is out there is that we have a board that doesn't understand the difference between science fiction and science fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| I'm a science fiction nut. I've been watching science fiction since I came back to the United States and found a TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=599)|
| 0:10:07| I used to watch Star Trek with Jim Kirk and his flip-up phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| I read the comic books Dick Tracy, where he talked to his watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| Watch Star Trek basically put nanites into people that basically made people well and killed people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| They should hit a little close to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| The reality of these are all science fiction years ago, and they're all science fact today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| Our board of health doesn't seem to understand that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| People are dying in droves. We've got mass graves. We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| CDC got caught fixing their numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| Bottom line out there, we've had about 9,700 people die in this country from the COVID disease, and even that's questionable because no autopsies have been run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=662)|
| 0:11:11| We've got a health director who seems to want what she wants in the manner in which she wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| We still have a mask mandate out there, which are putting children at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| because our school board has decided this is something we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| We need to start paying attention to science fiction versus science fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| Just because it was fiction yesterday or conspiracy theory yesterday doesn't mean it's not fact today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| We need to start paying attention. We need to start having people become informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| People aren't stupid. They're just ill-informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| If all you're looking at is CNN and getting your news from there and your medical information, you're getting half the picture because it meets their narrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| As they themselves have said, if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| We need to get the people of Knoxville to do some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| Go look at that. Go find out if masks are in the best interest of your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| Find out that the six-foot rule came from the Spanish flu epidemic, and there's no math behind that or science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=737)|
| 0:12:26| Go someplace like AmericanFirstlineDoctors.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| Look up the information. Become educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| Make intelligent decisions based upon science, not science fiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| For that, I appreciate your time. Good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| As requested by Commissioner Daley, before we move into the rest of public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| I'm going to call on Director Buch. Just as a heads-up to all those who are here for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| this will be the order when we come back. Andrew Fells, Megan Conley, Ryan Beatty, and Taylor Dempsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| Then I'll go through the rest of the list as we go forward. Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At the request of several commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=795)|

| 0:13:35| There's a lot of editorial writing out there that was trying to interpret the law that indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| that our sheriff was in violation of the law and that this commission was in violation of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| So I'm going to read to you. I'm not going to read that whole memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| but I'm going to distill it down to exactly what the statutes say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=833)|

| 0:14:20| Our legislature goes on to say a law enforcement agency may negotiate terms of a memorandum of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=860)|

| 0:14:45| concerning the enforcement of federal immigration laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| Federal immigration law says, among other things, under 8 U.S.C. section 1103,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=891)|
| 0:14:59| the commissioner, the commissioner, that's the commissioner of the Department of Homeland Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| may enter into cooperative agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| for the purpose of assisting in the enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| That is straight from the statutes. That is what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| The sheriff has entered into a contract with the Department of Homeland Security, as he's allowed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| And I go forward to say that under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| Article 6, Paragraph 2 states clearly that any law passed by the Congress of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=938)|
| 0:15:46| has supremacy over any law passed by any state legislature or local authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| The Supremacy Clause sets it out. It says that the sheriff can enter into an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| with Homeland Security, which the sheriff has done, and there's no limitations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| The government controls, the federal government controls all immigration law in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| There is no necessity or requirement for this body in any way to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| the law enforcement officer, the sheriff, in entering into one of these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| Now, keep in mind also that even under state law, the sheriff is a constitutional officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| He is elected. He has total authority to run his operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Knox County Commission and any commission in this state has no authority whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| to tell the sheriff how to carry out his duties, period. That's short and sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| The only authority you have is you control the budget. You have to approve the sheriff's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| Going further, it was suggested that I couldn't even believe this argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| that editorialists wanted to put in, that it had to go before the purchasing committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| that this was a contract for services. It makes no sense whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| because we're not contracting and paying out for any services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| We're servicing the United States government and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| and carrying out the immigration laws of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| The Court of Appeals has said that a contract for services, which would require commission approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| is limited to that in which it would involve the county as a purchaser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| and the service provider as a vendor, and where the vendor would provide specified services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| to the county in return for payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Now, if anywhere, this agreement that the sheriff's entered into under the federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| if anywhere, that kind of contract is beyond my comprehension how that could be interpreted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| but evidently that's been thrown out by editorial writers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| as being something that needs to be looked at by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| I hope you've had a chance to read Ms. Johnson's memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| She is an excellent writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| She's written and argued before all the courts in this state, federal courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the courts of appeals of this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| and she's a very good writer, and I can't say it any better than she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Short, sweet summary, that's what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| The sheriff has done nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| He has done nothing illegal, nor did the prior sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you, Director Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Our first speaker in public forum is Andrew Fels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Andrew, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| If you would, please state your name and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| and you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| My name is Andrew Fels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| I'm a Knox County resident, and I'm a local attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| and former judicial clerk for the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| Under Tennessee state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Knox County currently does not have a 287G agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| Knox County has been enforcing federal immigration law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| under the auspices of supposed 287G agreements since 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1159)|
| 0:19:30| Thousands of people have been detained for civil immigration offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| Without a 287G agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| local law enforcement cannot enforce federal immigration law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Without a 287G agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| enforcing federal immigration law is a civil rights violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| because you're detaining someone for a civil offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| The consequences of not having a 287G agreement are thus very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1202)|
| 0:20:11| There are two relevant Tennessee statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| The first is Tennessee Code Annotated 50-1-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| For the purposes of enforcing federal immigration laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| including, if applicable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| federal laws relating to the employment of illegal aliens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| the legislative body of a municipality or county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| or the chief law enforcement officer of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| upon approval by the governing legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| may enter into a written agreement in accordance with federal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| between the municipality or county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| and the United States Department of Homeland Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| concerning the enforcement of federal immigration laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| detention and removals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| and investigations in the municipality or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| Now, our state Supreme Court in Renteria Villegas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1252)|
| 0:21:01| said that because Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| had approved the Davidson County Sheriff's Office 287G agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| that agreement was valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| This body has not approved the Knox County 287G agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| There is one other statute worth noting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| which requires giving notice to the governor of a 287G agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| That statute is Tennessee Code Annotated Section 768-105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| It permits that a law enforcement agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| may negotiate the terms of a memorandum of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| Negotiate, not enter into, negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| If you want to enter into an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| that's under Section 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| However, there must be notice given to the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| if this negotiation has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| I have a Public Records Act request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| confirming that the governor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| never received any notice of the Knox County 287G agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| as of March 6, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1328)|

| 0:22:17| your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1337)|

| 0:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| My name is Megan Conley, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I'm an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| in the Department of Sociology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| where I research and teach about immigration policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Specifically, I study collaborative partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| between local law enforcement agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| and federal immigration authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Today, I will share the results of my research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| on Knox County's 287G program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| I will begin by explaining what 287G is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| by using a direct quote from ICE's fact sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Under the 287G jail enforcement model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| ICE trains, certifies, and authorizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| state and local designated immigration officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| to perform immigration functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| specified in a memorandum of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| After receiving comprehensive training from ICE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| designated officers perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1390)|

| 0:23:17| The Knox County Sheriff's Office attested to ICE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| that they understood the parameters of this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| when they submitted their needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| In that application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| the Sheriff's Office acknowledged that they understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1407)|

| 0:24:05| were originally brought to the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| following a local arrest on a criminal charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1447)|

| 0:24:43| I mean that they were arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| on nothing more severe than a license charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1485)|

| 0:25:04| It greatly warms my heart to know that my detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1504)|

| 0:25:11| Probably the next step would therefore be to ask for reparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| My detention has impacted me in the most negative way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1515)|

| 0:26:09| to discuss the significance and horror| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| of the unlawful 287G and detention bed contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| As students and community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| and may I reiterate, community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| we believe these contracts represent racist programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| that disproportionately harm and criminalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1581)|

| 0:26:25| We believe they divide our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| contribute to jail overcrowding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| and incentivize racial profiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1589)|

| 0:26:35| We believe the unlawful 287G and detention bed contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| work against our vision and make Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| an unwelcoming, unsafe place for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| As the county commission, you are not only responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| for approving these contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| but for representing all Knox County constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| It's time to do your job and address the harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| caused by Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| and the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| as they have unlawfully executed the 287G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| and detention bed contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Therefore, we demand that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| the Knox County Commission pass an ordinance or resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| decrying the fact that Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| declined to seek their approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| confirm the immediate termination of contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| in violation of state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| and block the county from re-assuming illegal contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Two, the county commission support the resignation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| of Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And three, the county commission divest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1641)|

| 0:27:25| and pay restitution to those subjected to unlawful detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| under 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| And now, the Students for Migrant Justice group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| will host a spelling bee to help the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| understand the impact of these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| We hope a spelling bee, which all of us have participated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| since elementary school, will help you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1658)|

| 0:32:11| to overlook this word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1931)|

| 0:32:29| 287G is a racist policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| that has no place in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| this contract disproportionately harms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1953)|

| 0:32:43| incentivizes racial profiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=1963)|

| 0:52:45| Baltimore. I was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| 35 years, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3167)|

| 0:52:55| but both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3175)|

| 0:53:05| I retired a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| and my wife and I made it very easy for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| to make the decision to move back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| In Maryland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| I was responsible for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3193)|

| 0:53:17| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| One of the things we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| was we served as trustee for a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| municipal financings. I was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| with the Maryland Stadium Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| when they were created. We served as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| trustee for the Oriole Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3209)|

| 0:53:33| projects. I'm familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| with how these financings work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| I've worked with them for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| When we moved back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| I heard about the Stadium Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| a couple of months ago, and I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| this is an opportunity for me to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| involved and give something back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| That's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| I'm here. I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| I haven't seen the financing package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| I don't know the people involved with the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| I just know how these stadiums work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| I've been involved with good ones, a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| of bad ones, but most all were good ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| That's the reason I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Thank you, Mr. Bass. Is there any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3245)|

| 0:56:05| the very, very late 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3365)|

| 0:56:13| to sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3373)|

| 1:04:43| them, and I know they are leaders in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| I do have a question for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| How did they get nominated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| What was the process of choosing the nominees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| Really the charge from the mayors in this process was for us to take resumes, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3900)|
| 1:05:09| we did, so some people sent in resumes and applications and showed interest, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| our other charge was we want to make this the best board possible, and a diverse board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| not only, as you see in race and gender, but also with their backgrounds and what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3922)|
| 1:05:32| are good at, and so ultimately we reached out to some individuals that we thought really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3932)|
| 1:05:41| were fitting for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| You heard Richard Bassey, he reached out, he had an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| One person that, I'll give you an example, one person we reached out to is the one who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| not here is Joan Cronin, and you know Joan's background and her history, and we were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| you know, call and see if you have an interest, and we're like, Joan, what's your interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| in this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| She said she is retired and she's getting off board, but she said this is one board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| I'd love to serve on, and so we really made a concerted effort to go after a board that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| we think is strong in a lot of areas that fill a lot of needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Is there additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| This is an incredible list of people who have been brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=3991)|

| 1:06:44| impressed with this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Chris, to the Mayor's Office and the City Mayor's Office, thank you for presenting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| with such an incredibly capable board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| Chris, can you tell us, the public, what this board is set up to do, what their authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| is, are they allowed to sign contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| Or Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| I'll let Mark do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| He's the legal expert that knows all about sports authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Sir, if you could please state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Yes, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| My name is Mark Mamentoff, and I'm at 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| This board is created under the Sports Authority Act, which is an entire act in the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Generally, their powers are broad, like most entities, like industrial development boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| and other similar quasi-governmental entities, where they have the power to own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| They have, obviously, a board of directors, which we're going in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| The main things that I think that you will see them do, with respect to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| is one is the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| They would be the actual issuer of the bonds to finance the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| Now, that will not happen until it comes before you all, and you have an opportunity to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| the financing and decide whether you believe it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| They would be, actually, the issuer of the bonds for various constitutional reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| and that's probably going to be a long discussion that you all want to hear a lot about, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| that's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| They would be the lessor of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| If the baseball team leases the project at Boyd Sports, who's a pro-tech, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| be the landlord to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| They would be the ones overseeing the ongoing lease to make sure it's operated in furtherance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| of the public interest, to make sure that we have a broad spectrum of events there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| things like that, and that the lease is being complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| So that will be a big part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| Those are probably the two main things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| They also own the property, as we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| It's anticipated that Boyd Sports would donate the property to the sports authority, so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| you look at the deed, they would likely be the owner of the property, and so they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| have to do the normal things that an owner of the property would, such as carrying insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| So those are the sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| To answer your question, Commissioner Daly, in terms of, yes, they can sign contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| but the big picture in terms of, and we get asked this a lot, can they meaningfully move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| forward without coming back to you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Number one, morally, it wouldn't be the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| This is a community project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| We need to come back to you all, but legally, they really can't borrow money without your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| all's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| So we will definitely be back here many times to visit with you all about financing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Sorry, we're having trouble tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Because they would be able to be the borrowing mechanism, would they be also the entity who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4165)|
| 1:09:40| selects the contractor for the baseball stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| The anticipation of Chris Caldwell, Mark Mamentoff, and Stephanie Welch from being involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| the negotiations is what, and we've talked about this with some of you all individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| as we've interviewed you all sort of about the project, is the anticipation right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| is that we would try to negotiate, again, with input from all of you all and this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| once it's hopefully approved, is to negotiate a turnkey development agreement with Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| Sports Inc. to build the stadium so that any cost overruns would be on them, that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| have a fixed price contract with them, and that there would be no cost overrun risk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Whether we'll succeed in that, you know, that's to be determined, but that, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| unless you all give us direction otherwise, would be the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| They would then turn around and hire a construction manager, essentially a general contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4230)|

| 1:20:54| I have great concerns over this and I will be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Sir, if you would state that you look like you want to address this, and I believe you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| from the development team, if you would state your name and address for the record and give us a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| Yeah, I'm Phil Kwelker, B&A Associates, 104 Clifftop Drive, Hendersonville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| I'm just here to answer questions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| do you want me to answer Commissioner Daley's? If you'd like to, it's up to you. Okay, well I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| have I guess a lot to say. It's been four long years and you know, there was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| RFP process and we were the highest bidder and we've done nothing but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| stick to the commitments we made in that RFP everywhere through this agreement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| The RFP was always submitted with a pilot in mind. I think the major reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| that we were selected was because our project was going to throw off more tax revenue than any other project, having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| commercial uses and hotel motel tax eventually. So I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| addresses your concern as far as tax revenue goes. Okay, Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| or do you want to? Commissioner Daley? Well I'm going to ask the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| and John can follow up on it because he's the one. You say no strings attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| This is your original request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| You might want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| all commissioners have a copy of the documents you're referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| If you'll look down at the second yellow dot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| I'll read it. I know he's working on it, I'm sorry guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| I have no idea what's going on. Simply a no strings attached offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| We are offering a fair cash purchase with no contingencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| and regardless of where Knox County Schools chooses to locate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| we will work with all parties to ensure a smooth and seamless transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| No strings attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| Well I mean I think this is just part of the financing mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| that comes with projects. I mean we need building permits, we need a lot of things. So I don't know that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| necessarily mean it's a string. I think I meant that we didn't need a market study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| to do the project we were doing. We didn't need to meet the public body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| for the project thing that we had experience in Knoxville. We're comfortable doing business here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| and that we were ready to proceed with the project as we presented in our RFP. And the project as presented in our RFP did include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| historic tax credits, some pilot incentives, included a certain number of hotel rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| included a restaurant, a rooftop bar, all that which we're keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| So I think that no strings attached to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| There was nothing else in that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| I and Commissioner Daley and I guess Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| and Commissioner Busler, well there's a handful of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| that were here when this was first proposed to the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| And so I've tried to do a little bit of research into the background on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| Andrew Johnson building. And for your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| Knox County procurement back in July 31st of 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| hired a real estate appraiser and consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| that cost probably around $10,000 to do an analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| or an appraisal of the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| And that appraisal came back at $8,250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| And they came back with an adjusted amount if it was going to be used just for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| of $7,950,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| So just $300,000 less. Now keep in mind that appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| was done six years ago almost. And we know where real estate prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| have gone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| And then as Commissioner Daley pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| that when we were advised from the mayor's office back then that the whole idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| was to put this property back on the tax rolls and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| provide employment for individuals, specifically I guess you could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| in the first district. And they won the proposal by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| saying that they were going to build a boutique hotel with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| 24 hotel rooms, a rooftop bar, and 75 residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| That they were going to provide about 100 jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| with an annual gross payroll of $3.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| But not only that, Knox County would have received hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| on those hotel rooms. And I believe those were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| initially to be determined at about $150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| And we would have gotten 5% for every night those rooms were rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| So with this proposal we've now lost the 100 jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| that could potentially go to the first district. We've lost the hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| for conceivably the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| I'm not aware when Commissioner Daley and I heard the presentations originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| that when the talk was to put it back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| was any talk of tax deferment or a pilot or a tip that I can recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| we as commissioners do have a fiduciary responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| to the taxpayers in Knox County when we have a viable asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| like the A.J. Building, which has the premier property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| on all of Gay Street with the best view of the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| that we would sell it for a discount and now offer concession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| after concession after concession. And as Commissioner Daley alluded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| in the procurement process, the other bidders that bid back in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| they haven't had the opportunity now to come back to the table now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| the cards in the deck have changed to be able to bid on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| So I'm not in favor of a pilot for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| project. So I'll be voting no as well. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| I had a question that I think it was a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| involved in this made a public statement saying that that kind of alluded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| question. Do you have funding commitment for this project yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| The funding in place for this project yet? Yeah. Well, yeah, we have an application in. I mean, we can't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| funding commitment until we have a commitment of all the. Do you have a bank that's saying they're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| to work with you? Yes, we do. Okay. That was just the one question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| I'll go back to the appraisal amount. I saw that appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| I think if you look at it, some of the assumptions that went into it as far as like the costs were very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| I don't know. Do you have the construction costs that went into that appraisal? This was the appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| of the building itself. Right. But it made an assumption it's a redevelopment cost. We saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| that appraisal. I think they were very, very under market. So I think that had a big effect on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| value of it. The other thing is when the RFP went out, I mean, you got offers. I think I forgot the six, eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| how many public bids. But appraisers are estimators as much as any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| But I think we get a bid for something. We came back with the highest in price bid. So I just want to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| put that out there that I don't think you're really selling it at a discount. We got the offer the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| money in a very public process for it. What's the other amenities as well? On the jobs, we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| taking the jobs away. We still have the commercial space in the building. The second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| one is, and as far as like, you know, hotel motel tax and, you know, the timing of that, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5347)|
| 1:29:16| we just presented, the second runner up on this project was an apartment deal. And I think we got leg up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| because we had more tax revenue, more job creation than the next runner up. And I say, all we're doing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| the way we presented this was because of COVID, because of the pandemic, because of the changes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| hospitality market, to the changes to the financing market, our ability to get it done, we made a plea to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| say, we think that the best path forward was to take the building, which we understand is going to be vacated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| this summer, that we were on a timeline to start this fall. Let's go ahead and get it designed, built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| stabilized, returned back into service, you know, before it has a chance to deteriorate anymore. And then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5389)|
| 1:29:56| you know, once this period of time, once the hotel market comes back, the hospitality market comes back, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| could get the findings for the hotel. If you happen to look at the report, the pilot report that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| in, there are really no revenues on running this thing. It's a very expensive apartment building to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| It's not something I think that is on our hearts or anything that we want to do. We're just looking to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| the project, you know, completed, put back in service so we can convert it to a hotel down the road because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| think that's the ultimate, you know, highest and best use for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| I have a couple of questions as well, but I'll wait until everyone's done. Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| Mr. Welker, if you do not get the pilot on this property, are you still interested? Is your purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| hinged on that specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| You know, I think it's going to put some of our, you know, they call them debt service coverage test into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| question. I think, you know, if you look at the apartment map, you know, we take the property tax, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| we have to have it covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| I mean, we have officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5453)|
| 1:31:06| Knox County County Commission, your meeting is over. We're not going to tolerate it that we've got a kid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| We got a kid who was murdered at Knox County School and that will carry on like these children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| don't deserve to have their rights and other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| And it's not okay what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| Commission will stand in recess for 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| I'm going to bring the commission meeting back into order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| I just want to just quickly point out, apologies for the interruption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| but we do have rules in this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Under rules in Section 8, people that refuse to be in order can be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| That's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| We also have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| I'll make a point that nobody that walked out of this room signed up for a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| Everyone had that opportunity all week, last week, for the last three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| No one signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| There is a way to engage with this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| There's a way to speak and be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| We welcome anyone to do it in a peaceful manner and a respectful manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| but we do not tolerate what just happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| That was clearly a stage set up for one purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| to draw attention, to draw in police reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| and to make this commission put in a very bad position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| So if anybody wishes to speak in the future, sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| Come talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| We are very reasonable people and we will listen to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| We're not going to tolerate that at this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| Sir, back on your topic, we are still on item number 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| I have a few questions, but I'll see if any other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Commissioner Vig, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| Unfortunately, I never got the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Yeah, so anyway, to answer your question, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| our financing package is pretty tightly wound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| so we're just now meeting the minimum debt coverage ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| So, yeah, if our taxes were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| exorbitantly more than we underwrote, then it would be probably a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Mr. Caldwell, I have a few questions if you would, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5587)|
| 1:33:18| Looking back through the timeline, the RFP was put out in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| closed in April and closed in July of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| And when we received, how many bidders do you remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| were part of that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| I'll let Matt answer that because he oversaw that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| And you have a microphone there, sir, right in front of you if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| Here comes Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Oh, Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Sorry, I thought you said Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5619)|
| 1:33:48| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Mr. Chairman, I believe there were six responses to that RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| And do you remember the low end of the bid and the high end of the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| The high end was $6 million from BNA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| I'm going to be guessing at the low end, but I know it was in the $4 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| I know there were six, five, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| I believe it went to five, one, and then everything was below five on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| Mr. Caldwell, how much tax revenue does the Andrew Johnson building generate right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| That would be zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| How much has it generated in the last 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| How many other projects downtown of similar nature have received pilots that are similar to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5666)|
| 1:34:34| The total number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Mark, do you know the total number of properties downtown that's received a pilot or a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| Does mine work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| I'd say between a pilot and a TIF in the downtown area, 25 maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| That would be my best guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| And is there one that is most similar to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| I'm sure that Philip would probably say the Farragut, which got a 25-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| And how much was that sold for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| It was privately transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| Three, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| I think it's three to three-five, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| And in this entire process, is there anything that – I mean, this process has been going on since October 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5712)|
| 1:35:20| And in addition to three years of analysis and review and discussion, then on top of that a global pandemic and certainly a changing marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5720)|
| 1:35:33| Is there anything that B&A has not done while Knox County has continued to plan, develop, change minds, figure out logistics, or go through things during this entire time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5733)|
| 1:35:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Is there additional discussion on item number 37?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| The motion is to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker, with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5763)|

| 1:36:14| You'll just let the record reflect 10-1 on the motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| Commissioner Daley voting nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| That motion passes, and it will be voted on next week at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| I'm going to – before we move on to further items, I know we just took a break because of the break, but there's a few of us that didn't take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5787)|
| 1:36:37| And we have a public hearing starting at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| So I'm going to put – let's see if anybody has anything they want to sort of slide in right before on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5800)|
| 1:36:49| Is there anything that is short and sweet anybody can think of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| I think we just have discussion items after that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5813)|
| 1:37:02| Let's – no, that's litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| We're going to talk about litter court there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| I'll just put – let's put it in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| We'll come back promptly at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| We'll do the merit council hearing, and then we will quickly go back to the agenda and finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| This commission meeting is in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Madam Clerk, what is our next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| Are we on 39?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| If you would, read the caption, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| This is a – on page 8, this is a resolution of the commission expressing support of state legislative action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| to enable the commission to designate Division V of the General Sessions Court for Knox County as litter environmental court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5858)|
| 1:37:47| and to establish enforcement powers for that court, Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5867)|
| 1:37:55| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Second by Commissioner Bussler, first by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| Commissioner Daly, I'll give you the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Hopefully we can get through this without the microphone going crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| This is part of the ongoing litter effort that I've got going, and during my research and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| and with the law director's office, you can go to the item 39 and you'll see attached where I had emailed the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5897)|
| 1:38:28| asking the question, could we have a litter court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| And the answer to come back is basically no, we could not have a litter court, but Mr. Morton did some research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5912)|
| 1:38:43| and he found out that there was Shelby County and Davidson County as special private acts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5923)|
| 1:38:51| and the best one that fit Knox County would be the Davidson County Act that was acted in 1992 or 1993,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5931)|
| 1:39:01| I don't remember right off what year it was, 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| What this does, it let Davidson County designate a court, which their court is the Division IV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5947)|
| 1:39:15| and we're asking for Division V, which is Judge Stansberry, to be our environmental court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| And if Judge Stansberry is ever too busy to hear any type of litter cases, environmental cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5962)|
| 1:39:32| could be codes department cases, it could be whatever that would come before his court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5972)|
| 1:39:40| this act, if it's passed by the state, it's got to go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| This resolution is only telling our delegation of Knox County that we support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| And then our delegation will have to go next year, introduce a bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| stating that we would like to be added to the Davidson County Private Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| This will give a judge, whoever this judge is, it will give them the option of setting up a litter referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| I call it CORB, it's Litter Referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| It says here any from one or more persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| I think one may be all right, but maybe two or three, that's up to the judge to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6016)|
| 1:40:24| If I see Mr. Smith, Commissioner Smith out there, and he gets caught for littering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6024)|
| 1:40:31| or he's got an Amazon box that's found on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| Could have picked anybody but me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Well, there's a lot of Mr. Smiths, okay, or Jones, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6036)|
| 1:40:42| If there's an Amazon box out there, and the environmental officer sees this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| picks it up, gets the evidence, and it's got Parsons Daily, 7508 Government Farm Road on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| he can write me a citation, and I can either pay the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| which is hopefully more than the $50 fine that Knox County Ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| That's another word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| I'm going to try to get everything written under the state ordinance, which is a lot stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| And I will have an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| I can either pay the $50 fine, or I can appeal it to the litter court or the litter judge, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6073)|
| 1:41:27| And if that one or two or three-person court tells me that, yes, you are guilty, I still have another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6087)|
| 1:41:37| I can appeal that to Division 5 Criminal Circuit Court, or General Sessions, I'm sorry, General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6097)|
| 1:41:47| So it gives an option where, hopefully in our budget this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| we're going to have an environmental officer that will be out there writing tickets for littering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| writing tickets for illegal dumping on people's property, illegal dumping on sides of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| When that officer writes that ticket, there's two options for that citation, three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| You pay it, you appeal it, and you can appeal it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| And so that's the main reason I need, the biggest reason I need this resolution passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| is to show Senator Massey and Representative Wright and Representative Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| that we support opening up some type of environmental court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6145)|
| 1:42:33| I'll open it up to the elected law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| He has been in conversation, if you would like to share any conversations with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| He's been my go-between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| Director Vick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| First of all, to talk about the $50 fine, state law on littering is strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| It's much more than $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| And that's something that Commissioner Daley and I have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| and Myers Morton, who did most of the legwork on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| But that being aside, I talked with Andy Jackson, judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| They circulate every six months as to who's the chief judge of the Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| And he said that he thought when they added Division V several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| I don't remember how many, ten years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| he thought that it was also to be an environmental court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| There's nothing in that ordinance resolution that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| He's very willing to hear all kinds of environmental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| not just litter but all other kinds of environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| But the way Davidson County did it, as properly stated by Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| then you've got no worries because that's been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| What they do, they call it a general law of local application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| That's how they get around the private act stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| And so you're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| You can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| We already have Division V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Davidson County has nine divisions, and they just had Division IV to be designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| So it's easy enough to have a legislature designate Division V to be an environmental slash litter court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6257)|
| 1:44:25| You hear all kinds of environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| So it's a start along that route, and I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| And Commissioner Daley has put in so much work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| and Myers-Morton in our office also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| Thank you, Director Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| I have a couple quick questions, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| This is you're asking the commission to essentially just support the idea for this litter court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6285)|
| 1:44:53| and send a message to our state legislators through this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| much like we've done with other resolutions similarly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Is there an estimated fiscal note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| If for some reason we were to encourage them, they were to do it and come back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| do we have an estimate of what kind of fiscal note that would be to create such a court here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| I'll ask that question to Director Caldwell if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| I don't know what it takes to run a—I mean, I know we're running courts anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| I don't know how much more it takes to add in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| If the judge hears it, the answer I'm pretty sure is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| Now, if he or she, the judge, decides that they're going to have a litter official or referee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6332)|
| 1:45:41| they do get some type of stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| I don't know what that amount will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| I think we did, what, $300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| Was it $300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| What did we do a couple months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| We approved some pay for some magistrates or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| Whatever that total is, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| But I do know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| If you're driving down the road and you don't have your cover your load law, it's a $500 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6360)|
| 1:46:10| and if that bag blows off, if it's more than 10 pounds, it's $2,500 to add on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6370)|
| 1:46:18| That's $3,000 plus up to 160 hours of community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| So part of the answer is if the judge hears the case, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| If we have to hire a litter referee or pay a litter referee once or twice a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| that may cost us something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| I think it's a great idea to encourage it and see what we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| I just would like for us to really understand what the cost might be to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| if a year from now we were installing this and had to pay some additional court time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| Mr. Collin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| Chris, have you got any idea, or can we find that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| If you can find it out later, that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| So do I need to change my mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| I think it's fine as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| I just think it's worth, as we explore it, because we're not really doing anything yet other than encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6424)|
| 1:47:10| So I just think it's worth understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| Is this a $20,000 annual expense, or is it a $250,000 annual expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Good question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| Mr. Law Director, if the state passes this next year, it won't be this year, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6441)|
| 1:47:29| It will be next year, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| Will it have to come back to the county commission to be approved as an environmental court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| set up an environmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Yeah, you'd have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| At that point, then you'd have your numbers on what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| If that court decided they wanted to have a sub-referee thing, what would that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| That would take a financial impact statement from Mr. Caldwell, yes, but not until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Is there any further discussion on item number 39?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| There's a motion to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6482)|

| 1:48:52| This is Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6537)|

| 1:49:06| Commissioner Daley, I'll turn it over to you to open the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| Chris, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| I'm sure we'll have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| This is the, I've heard, I call it the printing press from Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| I've heard it's raining money from the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| We're going to be getting this 90, I'm going to round off numbers, okay, 92 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| City of Knoxville is going to get 45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| Schools are going to get 112 or 114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| It's a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| And then the town of Farragut, I think, is going to get around 8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| And there's more coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| There's more printed money coming from Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| That may include FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| Y'all know that my second passion is fire and rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| I think we need to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| But before we take care of them out of the $92 million, we need to make sure that FEMA, we can use FEMA money first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6602)|
| 1:50:12| Chris and Perry and I had lunch together, and we discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| This was not the intent to overstep Mr. Caldwell and the finance department, because we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6618)|
| 1:50:28| We have got to have their expertise, and I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| I've been approached by a utility district that wants some of that money for infrastructure, upgrade utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6634)|
| 1:50:44| Well, that's well and fine, and I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| But like Director Caldwell said, we've got to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| We're going to have to have an MOU of understanding that if you spend this money wrong, you're responsible for that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6650)|
| 1:50:59| So all I want, and I want to make sure that when the finance department gets the rules from Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6659)|
| 1:51:09| which is number one, basically there ain't very many rules coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| Have you heard of any, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| There's not any rules yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| We need to park that money for whatever period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| Then the finance department can say, hey, we've got, we can spend money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6681)|
| 1:51:29| Chris agreed that I'm the one of the world's worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6689)|
| 1:51:34| I hate for somebody to come in on next Monday, hand me this piece of paper and say, this needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6694)|
| 1:51:42| And I talked to Chris, and I said, Chris, we need to know 30 days in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| None of this, you know, we need to add this on workshop night or the Monday before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6707)|
| 1:51:55| And I think we agreed, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| We did agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| So that's, it's not taking, I'm not trying to overstep the finance department, the mayor's office or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6720)|
| 1:52:08| But, guys, this is $92 million that when, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6728)|
| 1:52:20| This is $92 million that my grandson's going to have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| My granddaughter that's supposed to be born August the 4th, she's going to have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| And I want Knox County, and I told Chris and Perry this, I want this money spent wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| I want this money that when my grandson and my granddaughter and my other granddaughter has to pay all this money back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| they can say it was well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| Chris, you got any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| So my thought process is something as simple as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| Like we bring every month to you line of transfers or budget amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6783)|
| 1:53:11| we could bring what we think are allowable expenses that we think should be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6791)|
| 1:53:20| that this money should be used for, and it can be brought that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| This money will be tracked separately in our general grants fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| And so we know we've got a deadline as of now of December of 2024 to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6810)|
| 1:53:37| And we got some vague guidelines like any expenditure that's related to COVID that had an economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6817)|
| 1:53:47| That's pretty vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| The one that I think is not as vague is lost revenue compared to the 2019 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6830)|
| 1:53:58| And so I've already been working with the court clerks to get me their lost revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6838)|
| 1:54:05| And so we can, once this money comes, I think that's a really good expense that we should make them whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6845)|
| 1:54:13| Same thing would go for hotel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| We should make that fund whole as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| Those we know are lost revenues, we think, that are allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| But I still wouldn't do it until we get complete guidance to know what is really allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| Because with CARES Act, we would think something was allowable, then it would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| And so we had like 14 changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| And so I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| And he brought up, he got contacted by a utility department about wanting some of this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6882)|
| 1:54:51| I've been contacted by a utility department wanting some of this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| And so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| But then we get guidance from the state comptroller's office that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| hey, Knox County, hey, Anderson County, hey, whichever county, city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| we recommend you not divvy up your money with anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| We recommend you keep it completely for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| I think the reason they do that is they know that if they spend it on something that's not allowable, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| then it's up to us to pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| So if we donated that to ABC Utilities and we gave them $4 million for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6930)|
| 1:55:37| and they spend it wrongly, we'd be responsible for paying that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| And so if the mayor decides that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| he thinks that we should work with our utility departments or the chamber on some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| or any organization outside of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| I think it's important that we work with Director Buch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| and come up with some sort of contract language where we hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| I think the state's more concerned about rural counties who may just spend it outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| I don't, you know, they're going to say it's for everybody and they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6972)|
| 1:56:16| I think if we can show that we can be good stewards and we put some things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| But we should not spend, I'll say it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| we should not spend the first dollar until we get complete guidance from the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| And there was an email I got today that said that may come the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| The comptrollers told me, the mayor and I a couple weeks ago, he thinks it may be two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=6995)|
| 1:56:42| And so, you know, who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| And so we'll see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| But I don't have an issue with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| We don't have any heartburn in bringing you all what we think are allowable expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7011)|
| 1:56:58| or lost revenue to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| And then what we will do is the month that we bring them to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| we would wait 30 days and pay them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| So that's how we would operate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| So I think we would bring it, though, in the sense of monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| because as I said, this can go through 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| So, you know, it's long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| So just to be very clear, there's still no specific guidelines as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| And we're waiting for those guidelines to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| And whenever those guidelines do come in, it'll be related to the media as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| Oh, I'm sure the media will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| Yeah, because I've gotten some questions about Paulsdale PAL, ADA compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| and things of that nature, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| And honestly, my answer is, you know, it's really unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| And the reason we're getting contacted by these utilities is part of the vague guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| was water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| Now, why they decided to roll that out there with the other two, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| But they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| And so that's why those calls are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| With no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| Would you consider bringing these proposals to the Finance Committee first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7093)|
| 1:58:20| since that's a little bit more informal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| and then that way we'd have time to be able to work through those before you submitted them to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| for a work session agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| Yeah, we meet in finance quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| But, I mean, those can always be called whenever, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| whenever the chairman decides he wants to call a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| I don't have an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| I mean, we will do whatever you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| The only thing that I would say is there could be certain things that we may want to wrap up in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| if we get guidance to close out this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Because one thing I would like to do if we get guidance is to make Air Corps clerks whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7140)|
| 1:59:07| Okay, that would be able to allow Clerk Susano to pay off his loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| which would be closed at the end of the fiscal year, and it would make Clerk Hammond whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7153)|
| 1:59:19| and we'd have that done to end the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| That's the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Other than that, I mean, I don't think it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| Yeah, and I'd add the motel taxes and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| Motel taxes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| I would like to get them whole if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| How about the gas tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| We're $500,000 behind. Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| So your gas tax is intriguing, and Jim Snowden says it on me all the time about his revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| So one thing that we heard from the state related to gas tax that they wanted to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| was I believe that one year that would be in this calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| the final penny of the increase of the Improve Act went into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| If they were going to try to take that off and do a more apples-to-apples comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7202)|
| 2:00:09| we have saw a little shortfall, I guess, in gasoline tax, not as much as the state thought we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| But that's something else that we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| I think for us, we've got to make sure that when the feds give guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| they give guidance of is it all revenue that you could be considered for lost revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| I would tell you right now, while I'm hoping that court revenue is in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| I could also see them saying that's not lost revenue, that's deferred revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| Because eventually that's going to get heard and get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| So they may say court revenue is not allowed. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| We've just got to see what their guidance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| Yeah. I don't think I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| We have one of the best finance departments in the whole United States as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| I have the utmost confidence in Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| When I go to Chris and say, Chris, I need money, a commission we don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7266)|
| 2:01:11| then usually that's his answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| But every once in a while I get lucky and he does find me a little bit here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| But, Chris, we've got not only our finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| we've got resources from the state, CTAS, UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7282)|
| 2:01:29| So we've got a lot of resources to pull from, and I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7289)|
| 2:01:34| That's one of the reasons that I want to be proactive in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| I don't want to be spending my grandchildren's money in the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| I think for us, and I would just, we want to make sure that we get guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| and then put together a short-term and a long-term spending plan of what makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| and then bring that to the mayor and to you all as far as what we think would be helpful and allowable expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7318)|
| 2:02:06| I would just say to you that I agree that our finance department is one of the best in the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| They actually make me look good, which is really hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| This will put it on the consent calendar for item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7339)|

| 2:02:42| which amendment increases the maximum liability of the state under the grant contract by $183,392| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7362)|

| 2:03:37| which amendment increases the maximum liability of the state under the grant by $306,475.38,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7417)|

| 2:03:56| Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| I'll make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| Second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| We just sort of voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| You sure we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| I don't say I don't approve on second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| Sorry, 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| So next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7473)|
| 2:04:39| It's item number 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| Discussion item regarding the 287G program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| Commissioner Bussler and Commissioner Durrett, you all put this on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| I'll let you go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| First, I want to apologize on record to the students that were here from UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| that were with the students for migrant justice who were escorted out along with the protesters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| mistakenly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| So I just wanted to put that on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| I wanted to bring this because I do have concerns with the legality of our participation in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7520)|
| 2:05:30| I know we've said, we've heard, and in the memo that we received from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| that the 2018 code basically supersedes the 2007 code that says the commission must approve our participation in said agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7535)|
| 2:05:47| However, we entered into this agreement in 2017 before the 2018 would supersede.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7547)|
| 2:05:55| And to my knowledge, it never came before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| That's hard to hear. Can you just repeat that last part on the dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| To my knowledge, we entered into this agreement in 2017, one year prior to the 2018 code 7-68-105 being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7563)|
| 2:06:17| So that brings concern to me as far as the legality of our participation in said, in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7577)|
| 2:06:29| Can you help me understand this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| The sheriff entered into an amendment after that filing, so everything the sheriff has done has been legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7592)|
| 2:06:41| And I can go into a long and vol late at this night, but as I tried to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| that section of the 50-1-301 that everybody seems to want to rely on would be illegal under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7606)|
| 2:07:01| So there's no value, and that goes, and that's what the opinion was of the prior law director and the prior sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7621)|
| 2:07:08| I feel very comfortable with that, and I'm not going to change my opinion on that issue at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7628)|
| 2:07:15| So it was legal. It is very legal right now under Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7635)|
| 2:07:22| Okay. Also of concern is that I feel like it could be interpreted differently, and to me that brings concern of lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7642)|
| 2:07:35| I do know that Nashville participated in this program and then decided to withdraw in 2012 because of a lawsuit that resulted in a $490,000 settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7655)|
| 2:07:48| As was mentioned by some of the public forum members, we have seen quite a bit, over $800,000 to be exact, in lawsuits and settlements since I have actually been in this seat in the past six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7668)|
| 2:08:08| And so that is of great concern to me as well, as well as what it is ultimately costing taxpayers to participate in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7688)|
| 2:08:20| Commissioner Busse, sorry, Director Busse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| If that's a question, I don't think it's costing the taxpayers anything because we're getting paid by Department of Homeland Security, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7702)|
| 2:08:31| I know of no case, no case anywhere in this country where there has been a settlement for half a million dollars or even $1 to somebody who has been detained under 257G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7711)|
| 2:08:45| In fact, one in Nashville was filed in federal district court for the Middle District of Tennessee, was ultimately dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7725)|
| 2:08:56| And California, if you look out of California, the most liberal of liberal states in this whole country, the Supreme Court of California upheld the action by 257G law officers that led to the detaining and then finally a deporting of an illegal immigrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7736)|
| 2:09:19| Commissioner Busse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| When I first put this on here and put it on here, there was some innuendo about the legality of the commission not voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7765)|
| 2:09:39| And I've got, I've interviewed the past chair, the current chair, and the law director and asked them, was there any substance to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7779)|
| 2:09:51| And they said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| And in this resolution that was sent, prepared for us by the law department by Jessica Jarnigan Johnson, she refuted a lot of the things that the people were coming up here during this public forum and what they were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7794)|
| 2:10:13| Because I was looking in here and this was all addressed in this one document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7813)|
| 2:10:20| But the big issue here that I wanted to say about this was it's federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| It's not county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| It's not state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| But it's a federal law that they have immigration and how you're supposed to do it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7828)|
| 2:10:36| And in and of itself, well, let me say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| I believe in the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| I believe in this country and the laws that it has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| If they're wrong, we do something about them, we amend them, and we make them fit what they're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7845)|
| 2:10:54| This commission has rules and regulations that we have to abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7854)|
| 2:11:01| We as citizens have things that we must abide by under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| And in and of itself, if you come to this country without, say, illegally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| you've heard one confess that they crossed the river, come into this country, and finally work their way in through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7872)|
| 2:11:21| And in and of itself, that is law-breaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| I feel sorry for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| I wish we could do a lot of it, but we've got to do it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| We've got to do it in a way to where we protect the citizens that are already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| But to come in here and tell us, when we have no authority to really approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7895)|
| 2:11:43| that the sheriff has the authority to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| and then demand us to do something about it, which we don't have the authority to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7908)|
| 2:11:56| And we as a commission just have to stand up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| laws are laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| If you break the laws, then you must adhere to what the penalty is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| And here's one thing that I found out from both sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| If none of these people that we have on this document here, say 440 total criminal charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| that have been filed against the illegals on this thing that was prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| if none of these people had of been caught or doing anything illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7940)|
| 2:12:27| they would not be part of this statistics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| They would still be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| They would still be working in the public, and we know nothing about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| because our local authority does not have the authority to go knocking on doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| and pulling people out and arresting them because they don't have a green card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7962)|
| 2:12:47| or they're not here legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| They don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| So only if you break a law do you get caught at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| And we've got to realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| Are we going to live by the laws that we abide by every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| Are we going to let other people break those laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| And all I wanted to say about that is, if you put something in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| and make it an innuendo, make sure you do have the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| And the facts are, we do not have the authority to tell the sheriff how to run his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| I just have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| It was said that the portion of 7-68-105 that says when a law enforcement agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8008)|
| 2:13:36| enters in said agreement, notice is sent to governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| Do we have documentation on when that was completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| Randy Nichols, former attorney general who now works in the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| has told me that yes, he has submitted documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| And I would point out another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| Whether or not that law is in effect or not is not dependent on whether that information is sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8039)|
| 2:14:07| as an information item to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| But it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| I'm aware it doesn't affect the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| I just was curious when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| It has been done, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8055)|
