| 2:39:28| if you can't go to meetings, is essential, especially given how busy people are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9568)|
| 2:39:34| So that should be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| Second, variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| Currently, the applicant for a variance has to post some sort of notice on their property that a variance is being sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9579)|
| 2:39:52| And as far as I can tell, in Article 16, which spells out the process for getting a variance, it has dropped that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9592)|
| 2:40:02| So that raises the question, if you are living next door to somebody who's seeking a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9602)|
| 2:40:10| how are you going to know to go to the hearing of the Board of Zoning Appeals to voice your objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9610)|
| 2:40:20| The only way you could do it is to keep scanning the monthly agendas of the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9620)|
| 2:40:27| and nobody has time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| So that's a small but important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| And then finally, with plan developments, and this is in Article 16.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9632)|
| 2:40:41| the process is seemingly a long one, but actually it moves along very fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| There's a required pre-application consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| There's an optional concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| Then there's a required preliminary plan provided by the developer, proposed developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9653)|
| 2:41:01| that is considered by the Planning Commission and then on their recommendation, considered by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9661)|
| 2:41:08| After the preliminary plan is approved, then it's basically a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9668)|
| 2:41:14| The developer must file a final plan with the Planning Commission staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9674)|
| 2:41:20| The public is only officially brought into the process at the point of the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9680)|
| 2:41:28| when the Planning Commission and the City Council would, in effect, hold a procedure such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9688)|
| 2:41:35| That's not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9697)|
| 2:41:38| Three seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| The optional concept plan should be mandatory, and it should involve a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9700)|
| 2:41:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9708)|
| 2:41:49| Thank you, Ms. English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9709)|
| 2:41:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| Vice Mayor, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| I want to get through this meeting, too, but I think people need their five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| I mean, if we have to stay here, we have to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| I don't know what my colleagues think, but I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| I think they've waited for three hours, and they need their chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9722)|
| 2:42:08| Is that generally agreed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| Up at the five minutes, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| I'll just interject, too, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| If anyone feels that they need to talk about this, the five minutes isn't enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9736)|
| 2:42:21| We are all available to e-mail us, call us, sit down, have a cup of coffee, and go through things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| That's why we're arguing for more time is to have that conversation with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9747)|
| 2:42:32| Next is Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| Next is Larry Silberstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9758)|
| 2:42:45| And you have up to five minutes if you give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| Larry Silberstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| Just a couple comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| I think this has been another interesting session and a good session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9773)|
| 2:42:58| but I want to make clear that going forward, we have a lot more work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9778)|
| 2:43:04| There's just a lot to do, and we have to take our time to get it right, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9784)|
| 2:43:10| I believe we need an additional workshop after draft five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9790)|
| 2:43:14| but at least two weeks after the hard copy is available to both the public and the city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9794)|
| 2:43:20| It takes a lot of time to go through 300 pages and figure out what's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| what has changed, what is new, what is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| It looks like to me there's going to be a lot of changes from draft four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| and so there's been lots of changes every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| We just need to be sure there's enough time for everybody to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9816)|
| 2:43:44| Our neighborhoods and other organizations are also going to need the time to analyze draft five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| in order to make comments to their council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| Neighborhood groups, most of them meet once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| Some don't even meet that often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| We just have to have time for dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9838)|
| 2:44:01| and I don't think we can rush this through going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9841)|
| 2:44:07| I personally have found it rather disappointing tonight that the design center material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9847)|
| 2:44:14| the policy issues material were not available either to city council members before today apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9854)|
| 2:44:21| or maybe you only got them tonight, but they definitely weren't available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| So it is very difficult to sit here in the back and try to figure out what is even being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| It's hard to hear what everybody's even saying, and I feel like it's just been very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9871)|
| 2:44:37| You all look like you've been struggling yourself to figure it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| and we don't even have the paper to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| So I would just urge that if, first of all, I hope any of these materials will be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| I know the design center you said would be on site tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| but the document that you were given tonight about the policy issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9892)|
| 2:44:57| I think that ought to be put on the recode site as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| It's been 43 days since the last workshop by my count, approximately since February the 20th, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9901)|
| 2:45:07| and it just seems like it would have been helpful for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| if we had some of this material before we show up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9911)|
| 2:45:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| Next is Richard Esperanza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9917)|
| 2:45:22| Mr. Esperanza?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9922)|
| 2:45:23| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9923)|
| 2:45:30| If you would please give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| Richard Esperanza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| Actually, 8701 Unicorn Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| I also do some things on the radio at 1621 East Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9938)|
| 2:45:45| but I was just letting you know I spoke here before and had a couple of different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| well, I have two jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| Anyway, it seems like, as Mr. Silverstein suggested, things are being rushed a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9953)|
| 2:46:00| I think if you guys gave yourselves a little bit more time to look things over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9960)|
| 2:46:07| it would be much appreciated by the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9967)|
| 2:46:13| And, again, obviously the people need more time as well to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9973)|
| 2:46:21| and it seems a bit out of order to have the workshop before the draft is actually out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9981)|
| 2:46:31| So I commend you for suggesting to postpone it, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9991)|
| 2:46:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| Next is Danny Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| Mr. Kirby, if you would please give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10003)|
| 2:46:49| Danny Kirby, 3035 Port Royal Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10009)|
| 2:46:56| I'll try to keep it short in five minutes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10016)|
| 2:46:59| First off, on the notices that were sent out, we represent Turkey Creek Land Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| We have 13 properties out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| We have eight other properties under eight other entity names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| We received no notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| So I mentioned that to Mr. Lyons because I brought that up to Mr. Green earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10033)|
| 2:47:19| Mr. Lyons says, thanks for telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| So we don't know what happened with those notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| So I worry that not everyone received the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| As far as the notice itself goes, I thought it was a little, I don't want to use the word weak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10049)|
| 2:47:37| but you go through and tell everybody kind of what the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10057)|
| 2:47:42| and you highlight the good parts and say, in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10062)|
| 2:47:46| a proposed change would allow for new residential mixed-use reinvestment along commercial corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10066)|
| 2:47:51| which is not now allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| Well, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| C3 allows mixed-use developments on those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| Yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10080)|
| 2:48:01| It's a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| It's a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| Okay, so that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10084)|
| 2:48:08| And then you go on and say, in some places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| underused tracks will be down zoned from industrial to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| What you don't tell the person in here is, this is what your property is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10093)|
| 2:48:17| This is what the property is being zoned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| Here are the uses that you are currently allowed to do with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| Here are the uses that you'll be able to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10103)|
| 2:48:27| So this notice, all you said was, we're going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| Now, back to what Councilman Starr was saying earlier, when you do a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10111)|
| 2:48:39| if I want to rezone my property, I make application to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10119)|
| 2:48:44| The Planning Commission makes a recommendation, and then it comes to City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10124)|
| 2:48:48| and they vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| When I do that application at MPC, the surrounding property owners are notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10130)|
| 2:48:58| Well, it wasn't until it got to City Council that you all decided, hey, we better notify everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10138)|
| 2:49:03| And I'd be curious as to what Mr. Frost would say about the process being that you have to send out notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10143)|
| 2:49:11| and the amendment section for the zoning ordinance clearly specifies you do a site visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10151)|
| 2:49:18| you get a report from the Health Department, you run a public notice, you have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| These are all things that I have to do if I want to rezone my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| If you rezone two properties, you would have to go do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10166)|
| 2:49:30| If you're rezoning 74,000, for some reason, you don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10170)|
| 2:49:35| So why didn't MPC send out the notices and have the public hearings there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10175)|
| 2:49:41| So what I'm calling into question here is the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| I'm not sure we followed the proper procedure for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| So that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| But to bring up another example, Mr. Steyer, in just a quick review of the maps, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10192)|
| 2:50:00| there's property at Dearbrook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| This is an outdoor self-storage complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| It's currently zoned C6, which allows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10206)|
| 2:50:10| They've designated IMU, which does not allow outdoor self-storage units, not even as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10210)|
| 2:50:18| However, all of the properties around it are designated as CH2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| which would allow outdoor self-storage units as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| Going back to it, you can find these examples all over the place where you look at the map and you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| well, this doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10234)|
| 2:50:35| Why would they do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| And maybe there's a reason for a lot of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| But I think we all need to step back and think about, number one, did we do the process properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10239)|
| 2:50:45| Number two, we're not equitably applying the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10245)|
| 2:50:50| So if R1As all go to RN1 or whatever that designation is, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10250)|
| 2:50:56| This guy's R1A goes to RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| This guy's R1A goes to RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| I have C6 properties that are going to CR1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10262)|
| 2:51:06| Some C6 properties are going to CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| So they're not being applied equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| So how did we pick the winners and losers here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10271)|
| 2:51:16| That's the question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| In 30 seconds, I'll try to get just a couple more things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10280)|
| 2:51:28| Again, the CG3, the examples presented by the design center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| those are all great because you picked massive intersections to apply these examples to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10292)|
| 2:51:39| That's not who's going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| Go up Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| Every property is probably a half acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| That's the property that's going to be affected when somebody comes and tries to do something on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10307)|
| 2:51:51| and Broadway and Western and Magnolia and all these other quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| I'd like to see some of those examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10315)|
| 2:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| Thank you for your comments, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| This is Debra Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| This is not Debra Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10328)|
| 2:52:09| This is not Debra Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| Ma'am, if you don't mind, if you would wait until the end, and we'll call on you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10335)|
| 2:52:16| She said I could take her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10336)|
| 2:52:17| She's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| But if you wish me to leave, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| In that case, I didn't know you all had had that conversation, but if you would please give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10342)|
| 2:52:26| We have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10348)|
| 2:52:29| 5212 Daphne Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| And I'm here to speak regarding which department and which person does the zoning code interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10351)|
| 2:52:39| The last conversation at this meeting was that building code would be doing it, the zoning official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10359)|
| 2:52:48| Do we want our zoning code to be interpreted based on what is easiest to enforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10368)|
| 2:52:54| Certainly enforcement is a consideration, but the context, the intent, the impact, the philosophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10374)|
| 2:53:02| the broad documents supporting it for the general plan and the sector plan, the professional training involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10382)|
| 2:53:10| surely it would be the planning department that would be doing the interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10390)|
| 2:53:16| I'm sorry, and I mean no disrespect, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| but having building code and zoning make the interpretation is having the tail wagging the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10399)|
| 2:53:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10406)|
| 2:53:27| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| Next is Mr. Jim Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| Mr. Golden, if you would please give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10412)|
| 2:53:39| My name is Jim Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| I'm currently living on Cordon Road at 2314 because KEB set my house on fire a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10421)|
| 2:53:52| and codes enforcement had condemned it because I continued to help a woman in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10432)|
| 2:53:59| They didn't want me to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| And if you could confine your remarks to the recode effort, it would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| Well, this is about a motorhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10446)|
| 2:54:09| I wanted to park my motorhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| It's a reasonable size motorhome, not one of those giant buses that I wanted to park on my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10452)|
| 2:54:18| where my house had internal damage preventing me from living in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| Sir, are you going to deal with the recode efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10462)|
| 2:54:25| I brought this up at a recode meeting, and they humiliated me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| And this is a recode issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10470)|
| 2:54:33| The city council said I could not park my own motorhome on my own property, Mr. Wallace, and live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10473)|
| 2:54:44| And I went, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| I've done this all over the United States in my research work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| I can't do it in my own hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| I'm not sure that that's a recode issue, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10492)|
| 2:54:55| It doesn't sound like a recode issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| Well, it's a code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| It's a tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| You know, if you have some of these issues, you might want to deal with either me or our attorney, Mr. Frost, after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10499)|
| 2:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10505)|
| 2:55:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10507)|
| 2:55:08| But when I brought this up at the recode meeting on Tazeville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10508)|
| 2:55:13| That's a current issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| That might be more of a codes enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10516)|
| 2:55:19| It is a codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10519)|
| 2:55:20| And while this is recode, it's about the zoning, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10520)|
| 2:55:25| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10525)|
| 2:55:26| Oh, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10528)|
| 2:55:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10530)|
| 2:55:31| And I would add one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| We used to have public comments at the beginning of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10533)|
| 2:55:36| because the things that have been said here tonight might have helped you all understand things a little better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10536)|
| 2:55:45| than have to hear these comments at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| It seems sensible to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| Am I wrong about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| I might consider listening to some of these people ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10552)|
| 2:55:56| Thank you very much for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| Thank you, Mr. Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| Next is Jennifer Roach, if you want to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10560)|
| 2:56:06| I will not speak to home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| And give us your name and address again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| Jennifer Roach, 609 Wise Carver Road, on behalf of the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10570)|
| 2:56:19| When we were talking about Table 5.1, the 10,000 square feet versus 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10579)|
| 2:56:28| there on page 5-2 in Section 5.3, those are the standards that you have to meet to go above that square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10588)|
| 2:56:36| Is that correct, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10597)|
| 2:56:38| Could it be a little more clear as to whether they have to meet all of those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10598)|
| 2:56:43| or endeavor to meet some of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| You must meet B1 and B2 or B2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| Could it be a little clearer there as to what maybe we're trying for there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10610)|
| 2:56:57| On accessory dwelling units, I do think that the parking issue was the similar issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10617)|
| 2:57:04| that we found in a lot of other areas, so happy to find that being put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10624)|
| 2:57:08| I would like to make it address the parking that they find parking on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10628)|
| 2:57:14| whether that's already existing and they don't need to build anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| they have a large driveway or a long driveway or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| or that they would need to build new parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| but that they could use existing parking if it was adequate for the ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10645)|
| 2:57:30| I do have a question on that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| ADUs may be detached, attached, or within the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| I was just concerned or have a question about how the permit would be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10658)|
| 2:57:46| or enforced with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| If I close off my basement door and make it an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| would that be a special use if it went that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10671)|
| 2:57:56| Those are just some questions that I would like addressed in the final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10676)|
| 2:57:59| And then, you know, if ADUs were moved to a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10679)|
| 2:58:05| along with an owner-occupant requirement, we feel like that would be too restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10685)|
| 2:58:09| that it would either be owner-occupied or special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10689)|
| 2:58:14| And then also have a concern about if it's not owner-occupied now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| if it's an existing, maybe there's two long-term renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| what would be the status of that in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10701)|
| 2:58:24| Would that continue with the property or just with the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| So that's a question we would like answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10708)|
| 2:58:32| One of the issues that Mr. Kirby brought up is in the commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10712)|
| 2:58:38| a comparison chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| I know there's a commercial office industrial comparison chart out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10720)|
| 2:58:43| but one that shows uses that went away in that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| uses that went from P to S or S to P,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| that I just don't have the time to do every one of those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10732)|
| 2:58:57| And it would be really helpful and put a lot of people at ease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| if we could see current code versus recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| what uses, like we did with the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| I know that's a heavy lift for this late in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10746)|
| 2:59:09| but it's something that we've been trying to put together on our end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| and it would be helpful from the other side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10752)|
| 2:59:17| In planned development, one of the options there is to provide affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10757)|
| 2:59:23| and I know that we're going to be adding some details to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| but maybe what affordable housing means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| if it's defined with a median income or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10769)|
| 2:59:33| would be helpful for developers to have some goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| some point to move towards there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10777)|
| 2:59:41| And I think among our membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| we could find a lot more broad support for recode if that post-adoption review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10784)|
| 2:59:51| was codified, that stakeholders committee was codified afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10791)|
| 2:59:55| We have not addressed the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| and that was supposed to be addressed within six months after adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| so we would hate to see recode go the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| We would love to see that codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10803)|
| 3:00:04| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10805)|
| 3:00:06| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| Okay, last is Michael Stinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10807)|
| 3:00:12| Is Michael Stinson still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10812)|
| 3:00:13| Yeah, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10813)|
| 3:00:22| Michael Stinson, 1401 Cuesta Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10822)|
| 3:00:26| I do want to thank you for bringing about the additional workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10826)|
| 3:00:31| especially with the new draft that's going to be coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| It still seems to me that there is still a lot of concern, a lot of confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10834)|
| 3:00:39| and I am also in full agreement with Mr. Silverstein as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10839)|
| 3:00:44| We don't need to try to rush this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| Whenever you try to speed up the clock and try to make things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10847)|
| 3:00:52| regardless of how important you think it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| you can end up doing more damage than good for the general people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10855)|
| 3:01:00| But some of the things I was actually wanting to ask about is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10860)|
| 3:01:06| especially when it comes down to the impact that this is going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10866)|
| 3:01:10| within every property owner, every citizen that's within city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10870)|
| 3:01:16| I'm asking that we actually consider making this a ballot question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10876)|
| 3:01:23| I ask you tonight to place the recode on the ballot in August or November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| so the property owners can decide themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| It is their property, after all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| and this is going to have an impact on their said properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| So with that being the case, I think it's only fair that the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10896)|
| 3:01:40| have a voice in voting on this recode situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10900)|
| 3:01:45| Another one of the issues that I'm seeing is also when it comes down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10905)|
| 3:01:51| Americans with disability compliancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10911)|
| 3:01:56| I'm trying to figure out if the mixed-use design is a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10916)|
| 3:02:01| like the one in the Farragut that does not discriminate against the elderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| and handicapped, and it is ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| We have to understand that people with disabilities or elderly people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10929)|
| 3:02:14| they don't have the means to walk around to ride a bicycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10934)|
| 3:02:20| and this is going to inhibit their means of trying to get to and from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| when they're trying to live their daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10944)|
| 3:02:28| Another issue is that even potentially considering getting rid of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10948)|
| 3:02:34| accessory dwelling units, there's possible issues that we're just looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10954)|
| 3:02:41| basically regardless of whichever aspect you look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10961)|
| 3:02:45| But another thing that I am wanting to ask is just because when it comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10965)|
| 3:02:50| to securing our liberties, one of the things I was thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10970)|
| 3:02:55| is someone that has interests from out of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10975)|
| 3:03:00| He could be in Dubai, but he could end up buying a large portion of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10980)|
| 3:03:07| He can break up all of those lot sizes to create multiple lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10987)|
| 3:03:12| and as long as it's basing the new compliance with the minimum lot sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10992)|
| 3:03:18| he can actually rezone it to multiple lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=10998)|
| 3:03:23| And when he does that and he builds those houses to make a profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| well, that's going to leave the existing houses with larger land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11008)|
| 3:03:34| They're going to have a higher value because now you've actually reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11014)|
| 3:03:39| the number of available lot sizes that actually have a happy yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11019)|
| 3:03:46| For example, if you've got kids who want to play catch in the backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| you can't obviously do that if it's a small yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11029)|
| 3:03:53| So what's going to happen as a result of seeing these changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11033)|
| 3:03:59| within your neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11039)|
| 3:04:00| What's going to happen on your property taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| I mean, this is going to hit your taxes, and so your property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11043)|
| 3:04:09| may actually go up 400%, 500% just because you're the last house left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11049)|
| 3:04:14| in this neighborhood that actually has that full yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| Everyone else has been cut out into cookie cutters that all look the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| and the property itself is actually, well, the neighborhood itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11061)|
| 3:04:26| has lost its appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11066)|
| 3:04:27| It's lost its uniqueness, its qualities that brought you to that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| But what I'm asking is just that the city actually take the time to evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| how is this going to impact people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| We're looking at introducing a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11080)|
| 3:04:45| These changes are not going to come cheap, they're not going to come free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11085)|
| 3:04:49| and they're not coming from charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| So how much is this going to cost us as citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| Because all of us here tonight are obviously here because we share these concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| but what I'm wanting to also know at the same time is how much is this going to cost me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11099)|
| 3:05:04| I was actually on the Bell-Morris Community Action Group for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| and we tried to fight for many of those years trying to get sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11108)|
| 3:05:12| and we could not get the sidewalks just because of the simple cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11112)|
| 3:05:15| But now with this new blanketed statement, it's going to be a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11115)|
| 3:05:19| that we're not going to have a say in the matter, we're going to just have to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| Mr. Jensen, thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11126)|
| 3:05:27| Counsel, that's the last of the public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11127)|
| 3:05:32| Thank you for your patience and your questions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| Audience, I thank you for your patience and your participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| and we are now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11139)|
| 3:05:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11140)|
| 3:05:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=11141)|
