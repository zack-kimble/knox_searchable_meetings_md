| 0:00:30| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=30)|
| 0:00:39| call to order this October meeting of the Knox County Commission work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=39)|
| 0:00:49| Commissioner Gill, Commissioner Carringer, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Nystrom, Commissioner Skidmaker, Commissioner Anders, Commissioner Bessler, Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Daly, Commissioner Thomas, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=49)|
| 0:01:09| I call on Commissioner Daly to invite a special guest up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| Okay, today's pledge, I'm going to invite a good friend to all of us, Mr. Mike Steeley. He is a veteran, and I'm going to ask you if you would, would you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=74)|
| 0:01:32| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=92)|
| 0:01:54| Okay, let's move on to the amendments to the agenda. First off, on item number 64, the Mayor's appointment to the Ethics Committee for the spread of record. The Mayor has recommended Jennifer Roach for that, so we can put that into that blanket this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=114)|
| 0:02:13| Second, next month I am going to go back to using the commission forum, so when we get here, I can already have out to you guys the ads, the withdrawals, the deferrals, and a list of things that I want to see open discussion about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=133)|
| 0:02:30| And that way when we sit down, it will be a lot quicker and simpler to move forward, if everybody's okay with that idea. And I know that I've forgotten my password and username on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=150)|
| 0:02:43| It's your email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| It still didn't work. But John Gustin is going to get with us and reset them all and get all the information to us so that next month we'll be able to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=165)|
| 0:02:56| Okay, first of all, for additions, I have number 58, R-17-10-905. We have a discussion item of audit committee. We have a discussion item of public hearing on the upcoming zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=176)|
| 0:03:21| And there was an item that came over from MPC today that didn't get through the agenda quick that we need to add, and that is 7-D-17-RZ. Is there any other items that need to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=201)|
| 0:03:39| I'd like to add for next Monday a discussion on rules committee. Not tonight, but maybe next Monday. Make sure we get it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| Okay. I have two withdrawals. Item number 5, that is R-17-10-102. And number 8, R-17-10-201. Any other items to be withdrawn? Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=227)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you. I've been out dealing with the family loss recently, so I didn't have a chance to drill down on the agenda. I do know that I'd like to add for discussion a quick update on the committee that met to discuss the employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=253)|
| 0:04:28| Okay. I think that's already on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Is that on there? All right. Good. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Okay. Under defers, I have item number 60-017-10-102 deferred to next month. Is there any other defers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=274)|
| 0:04:55| Are you guys ready for items of discussion? R-17-10-110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=295)|
| 0:05:06| Can you do the number? Do the item number instead of the agenda? Or do you have an agenda with item numbers on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=306)|
| 0:05:15| Number what? Number 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=315)|

| 0:06:20| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| I would like to discuss item 10 for schools, I think 41 for public works, and item 51. 10, 41, and 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=381)|
| 0:06:39| I'd like to add item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| Could we also, you had 26 down there, could we also do 27? That's R-17-10-222.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=410)|

| 0:07:42| Is that all everybody sees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Do I have a motion to add all we need to add, withdraw all we need to withdraw, defer all we need to defer, and set the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=464)|

| 0:08:18| I need a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Page 1, item number 6, is consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| appointing to the North County Ethics Committee Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| With the proper motion before us and a second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=529)|

| 0:08:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=532)|
| 0:09:02| Item number 10 is a resolution approving a lease with the Robert D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| Cranton Park for parking space at the North County Schools Fifth Avenue building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| at a cost of $45,045.96 for the first year of the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| with a 3% increase in rent each year thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Resolution 203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Mr. Oaks is on his way, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| Good afternoon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Can you fill me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| I did not get a chance to call to find out about what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Where is the property located and why are we needing to pay $45,000 a year for parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| This is a piece of property that's adjacent to our maintenance lot over between Magnolia and Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=588)|
| 0:09:59| It's about three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| It includes a block storage building, which would be between 1,000 and 2,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| We've had it under lease for about the last 20 years, and this is to bring that lease up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Now, this is a substantial increase in the lease price, but we've had a pretty good deal on it for the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| Our problem is that we are landlocked over there, and we're really limited on what we can use for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| so we use this piece of property, about three acres, plus or minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| We put about 100 trucks on it every evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| and we use it in the daytime to park our maintenance staff privately-owned vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| Just to make clear, it's just for parking only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| It's not leasing a building. It's just for parking only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| That block storage building is part of the lease, so we've got a small storage building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| but it's primarily parking space, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| Was that part of the lease, too, this $45,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I tried to read up on it a little bit, and it seemed like there was a building involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| and then I wanted to clarify that, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| We have a proper motion before us in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| On page number 4, item number 26 is approving a fund balance designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| general purpose school funding the amount of $450,000 for renovations at the Carnes High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| for the Culinary Arts Program constructed by Shelton General Contractors, Resolution 219.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| Yes, sir, I'd like to, if the superintendent would come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| Really, I guess the question is, we've all read about and know about what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| but what measures have been taken by the body, the board, or the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| to ensure that this does not happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| Bob Thomas, Knox County Schools, Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| Appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| We had internal controls in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| What we found out, obviously, was those internal controls weren't strong enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| so as of a few weeks ago, we put some measures in place to keep something like this from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=744)|
| 0:12:33| In terms of approval of the requisitions entered into the financial system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| that's been a little bit broader in schools, and we've narrowed that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| We're saying now, at this point in time, that's going to be restricted to designated personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| in the business office, the facilities department, maintenance department, and the IT department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| Again, it's been a little bit broader process until this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| Can I stop you there on that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Are these the same people that had the ability to do that anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Well, the CTE director had the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| He will certainly no longer have that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| It will be restricted to, again, business office and finance and maintenance and IT, so none of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Did they have access to this information as it occurred this last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| Some of the departments did, like the facilities and business department and C&I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| They had to spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| How are we preventing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| We've only stopped the CTE from controlling the flow of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| How are we preventing this from happening again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Because the others were a party to this as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| But not to the part of entering the requisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| Now it's restricted to several departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Before, it was broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| The CTE director could do that without the department head approving it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| and without anyone in business office actually approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| So that no longer will be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| And we've also looked at our requisition process and revamped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| The department head approval certainly will be necessary in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Before, the CTE director was able to do that without getting approval from his department head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=851)|
| 0:14:20| which would have been the executive director of innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Also, the budget director will now have to be part of the approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| before requisition can go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| Also, contracts, agreements, and purchase transactions requiring board approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| be routed through the law department by the department processing the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| rather than requisitioning department to have some segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| The problem was there was not enough segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| One person was allowed to do multiple transactions without anyone overseeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=892)|
| 0:15:01| Also, additional training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| We went through a physical plan upgrade audit a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| The internal audit department with Knox County actually looked at our physical plan upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| and there were some findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| One of the findings was that we needed a capital asset management policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| We developed that policy, and we provided training on that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| It clearly states that any project $100,000 or greater needs board approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| and that's part of the requirements of that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| There was probably about a half a dozen policies violated here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| so some additional training regarding the capital asset investment policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| Also, in the procurement and accounting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| we are limiting the spending to the line item control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| whereas before it was really at a broader level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| which would allow someone to overspend a line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| So now we've put restrictions in place with Munis, which is the county's financial system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| so that there will be line item control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| In other words, a person will not be allowed to overspend their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| because there's money in the total budget that will be done by line item instead of the major category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| So those are some of the internal controls that we put into place to keep this from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| Again, I apologize for the county commission and the school board even having to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| It should have been something that never got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| There were several opportunities for it to not have gotten to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| Those all failed because of several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| One, a CTE department took responsibility for management and construction of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| That shouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| In the future, there are only two departments, facilities and maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| that actually will be the ones to oversee any type of construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| There were some gaps, as you mentioned, gaps in communication between the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| between the CTE department, also the facilities department, and also superintendent's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| So we're working to make sure that we don't have any gaps in communication such as that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| There was also failure to adequately provide oversight and supervision of the individual that took on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| Again, we're taking steps to make sure that that doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| Again, I apologize for you having to deal with this and the school board having to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| It should have been something that never got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| Commissioner Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Mr. Thomas, I'm sorry you have to deal with this the way it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| But I understand that this started several months before you were ever in as a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| We've been able to determine it started around February of 2016, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| when the initial discussions were started and the architectural firm was actually employed, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| in the spring of that year and drew plans for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Now, this was kind of like a little something planted out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| Is there any more of these little agreements around there anywhere that's going through the school right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| that we don't know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| To my knowledge, there are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Of course, the CTE director is stillóthe investigation there is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| And that could still take several months to be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| because there are other agencies looking at that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| There's no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| The motion is to approve Resolution R17-10-219.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| The ayes have it unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Item number 27 is a resolution approving a contract with Mobile Fixture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| for the purchase of installation of dish machines at Norris County Schools cafeterias| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| and amounted to $450,000 for the term of November 1, 2017 through October 31, 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| with the option to extend for four additional years one year at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| for a possible total of five years Resolution 220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Vice Chair Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Vice Chair, I wanted to ask the school system here about this allocation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| Is that something similar to the culinary top school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| Is this something completely different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| This is for our food service operation and to replace this particular amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| is to replace dishwashers that we have that are leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| We have a proper motion before us and a second to approve Resolution R-17-10-220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1217)|
| 0:20:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Resolution passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Item number 32 is a resolution authorizing the acceptance of a donation of a police service dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| with an appropriate value of $10,500 for the Metro Day Canine Services in Miami, Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| for the benefit of the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Resolution 303.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| When I was reviewing the agenda, this one kind of jumped off at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| because I know how valuable those dogs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| So I thought this is interesting, and when I researched it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| I realized that the dog training academy down in Florida, actually, they sell those dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| That is the market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| They're actively selling those dogs for $10,000 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| So I did a little bit of follow-up on this with Sheriff Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| and this is actually a very interesting story that I think warrants being shared with both our commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| as well as our citizens who might be viewing this meeting back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| So, Sheriff Jones, if you could kind of provide some insight to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Yes, that is the company that we use to buy our canines through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| Jimmy Jones, 5212 Binfield Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| That is the company that we use in Miami that we buy our canines through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| and he called our canine trainer up here and said that the hurricane was going to hit down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| They are located close to the ocean, and he asked if we would be able to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| He had approximately 40 dogs down there that he was scared that he would lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| So we sent a group of our guys down there and loaded up his 40 dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| and brought them back to Knoxville for safekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| and then once the coast was clear back down there, we took them back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| So they donated a dog to us for us doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Wow. That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Does he have a name and rank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Yes, he does. I'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| I can tell you the story, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| They called me on the way back and said, we've got them and we're on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| and you can imagine all I could hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| I couldn't hear anything at all that they were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| but you can imagine 40 dogs in kennels in a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| So when those two guys got back that drove down there and back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| I certainly am looking for a way to compensate them for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| And I withdraw the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Or they might be suing for hearing damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Maybe a worker's comp claim coming later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| The question may have been for proprietary information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| I withdraw the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| What breed of dog is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| It's a German Shepherd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| It is? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| We have a proper motion and second before us to approve Resolution 303.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| The ayes have it unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| On page 7, item number 41, is a resolution authorizing the acceptance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| $260,000 from the Tennessee Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| authorizing the expenditure of up to $200,000 for these funds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| transportation and utility improvements at the commercial site at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| intersection of Chapman Highway and John Saphir Highway, Resolution 406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Motion to send without any recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Let's hear from Mr. VandeVate first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Commissioner Daley, Dwight VandeVate, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| To begin with, a profuse apology to all of you, in particular Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| Daley, because it was my intent to have the memo that I delivered to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| this afternoon to commission no later than Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Unfortunately, we were waiting on the Tennessee Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| Transportation, but in all fairness, the history of this matter is so old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| it was very difficult for them to go back and get all of those dates and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| all of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| So I wouldn't want you to think I'm laying this at their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| They've been working as hard at it as we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| It's just that the information couldn't come together any sooner than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| I literally got the last email from them a little after 3.30 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| Otherwise, we would have had this to you a lot sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Procedurally, if I could, let me just go ahead so that it's entered into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| the record and say the caption would need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| The state has advised us that they would not take possession of these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| that these funds would pay directly to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| So at the time that Jill helped us with this, our understanding was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| the state would take possession of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| As it has turned out, as the state's looked into it further, that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| So the resolution caption and the resolution itself would need to be redrafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| A little bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Some weeks back we were approached by Mr. John King on behalf of a group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| developers who have acquired a parcel of property at the corner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| John Sevier and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| We refer to it as Chapman Triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| It's an undeveloped parcel of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Mr. King's clients proposed to develop this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| In doing their due diligence to acquire the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| they determined that they were going to need access control breaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| that have to be authorized by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| The state of Tennessee advised them that the loss of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| as is the case always with a state or county project, was a compensated event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| So the property owner at the time, and we think probably 1974,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| who owned the property lost access as a result of work that the state and the county did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| That property owner was compensated for that loss of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Fast forward to 2017, it is the state's position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| based on guidance from the Federal Highway Administration since federal funds were involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| that if you compensate a property owner for loss of access at the time a public road project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| causes that loss of access, that likewise if you are going to increase the value of a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| by granting access back, that that property owner has to pay the appraised difference in value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| between what the property would be worth without the additional access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| and what the property is worth should the state grant that access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| So that figure was determined by TDOT's appraiser to be $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| Mr. King's clients have asked, and I shouldn't speak for him, he's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| and he'll speak to this far more eloquently than I will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| that in order to develop this parcel they are going to have to make a number of improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| both in terms of public right-of-way and in terms of utility extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1647)|
| 0:27:35| They are asking that $200,000 of these funds could be set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| or used to cover the cost of those utility improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and those right-of-way improvements, those access improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| Clearly, as I told you in the memo, and again I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| I wish I could have had this to you so much sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| that is in effect something in our opinion internally akin to a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| It's clearly an investment of what would otherwise be public money into private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| and it is very much outside of our lane and a decision that needs to rest with the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| That said, one of the things that occurred to us in our discussion with Mr. King and his clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| is sort of a but-for standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| That value, the value of the increase in the value of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| based on the granting of that access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| I suppose you could view that as an asset that the county owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| and clearly the appraisal says it's worth $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| However, given that those funds will never convey to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| unless somebody actually develops the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| we viewed it as sort of a but-for standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| But for this development, these funds would not be under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| So we thought it was a fair thing to capture the question as best as we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| and I know it's confusing, and I'm sorry, I wish I could make it simpler than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| but we thought the thing to do was capture the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| and then just put it before this Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| as to whether or not you think the funds should be spent in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| So I hope that's helped some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| Again, I hope the memo helped some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| There's also some explanation from the state attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| as well as a sketch from Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I'm sure that Mr. King will have additional thoughts that he would want to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| We're not taking a position here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| We don't think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| It's not a transportation question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| It's really a public policy question regarding these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| and so we thought it best just to leave it with Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Commissioner Daley, does that help any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Yes, sir, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| The state says it's $260,000 in value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| but we're only going to put $200,000 toward road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| Yes, sir, it would be towards, and that is a matter that would need to be clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| We would assume it would be towards utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| because there will be utilities that have to be relocated or extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| and towards road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| You know, tweeting out next Monday, I'm sure, this was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| I appreciate the information, but we need to look at it a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| That's one of the reasons I said without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| You know, there are concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| I do understand this intersection needs to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| and we may have to look at a way to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| but I don't want to get caught in Knox County paying $200,000, $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| for a road improvement or an access improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| in two years where it's annexed into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| You know, that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| You know, I don't want to spend taxpayers' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| and then for some reason we're going to lose the cash registers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| So, you know, I'm sure Mr. King will be contacting us before that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| so there will be more questions next Monday, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| Given your statement on the caption on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| do we need to amend this caption before we pass it with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| so that we have the correct caption for our Monday meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| I'd defer to Mr. Armstrong on that, but yes, sir, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| It would make sense to me, and I know the state would take comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| The state was concerned that the caption indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| that they would take receipt of these funds, and that is clearly not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| How would you wish that caption to read at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| I would assume simply authorizing the acceptance of $260,000 from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| I believe it was LeConte Development LLC that specified in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| Knox County would accept those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Would the maker of the motion allowed to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| to change the caption before we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Yes, what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Okay, I need a motion to make an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Okay, so what we're voting on is the amendment to the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| Mr. Schoonmaker? Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I had a question for him, but not in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Okay, you want to go ahead? We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| The motion is to amend the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Now we need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| All right, the motion will approve Item 41 with Knox County accepting the funds from LeConte, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1940)|
| 0:32:30| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| You're right. I'm sorry. No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Does LeConte LLC own the property at this point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| To my knowledge, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| The records at KGIS do not indicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| I don't think that's the state's understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Mr. King could probably speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| They may own an option on the property, but I do not think they own the real property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| And do you happen to know what the acreage is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| I'll find out before Monday, Commissioner Schoonmaker, but off the top of my head I'm reluctant to venture a guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Is there a continuous connection to the city on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| It touches the city, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| I wanted to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| When we actually originally drafted the resolution, I included the city as potentially having some regulatory role in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2002)|
| 0:33:31| We've since backed that out because we weren't certain, but Commissioner Daley's concern is material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| because there are a lot of incorporated parcels in the general vicinity of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2016)|
| 0:33:48| Mr. King, did you want to say something, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Excuse my casual dress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| I forgot about this meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I don't know how I could have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| John King, P.O. Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2040)|
| 0:34:08| To fill out a list a little bit on what Mr. Vandervate said, we have a contract for the purchase of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2048)|
| 0:34:22| It has been extended for the purpose of getting all this worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| So we do have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| The entirety of the property we are acquiring is 3.49 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| The other thing is he's given you a bit of the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| but one of the reasons there was a little bit of confusion about describing what it is we want done was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2083)|
| 0:34:55| the state first took the position that it was their property and they owned it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| and they had the right to go forward and go through this whole process about declaring it surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| and then telling us ultimately after a little bit better than a year what it was they appraised it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2109)|
| 0:35:19| Essentially what we're getting is a 40-foot wide break in an access control fence that there's some issue about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2119)|
| 0:35:29| but that's what's there and we're getting a 40-foot cut in that fence for $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2129)|
| 0:35:37| After our research, when I got into it and brought it to the attention of the state that I had a real question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| that they had anything to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| They did some more looking and finally concluded that, yes, it does appear the property that needs to be dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| is property of Knox County, but the money, the funds will be paid over to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| That's where I drafted the agreement, and the agreement basically provided we're going to pay that $260,000 directly to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2163)|
| 0:36:15| If we have to pay it to the state, then the state must immediately pay it over to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| They've now concluded and I think it's correct that the money should be paid directly to Knox County, which we're willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2182)|
| 0:36:32| In addition to some of the infrastructure matters that he mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| I believe there may be a couple of traffic lights involved that may be slightly relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| There is a construction of a right-in, right-out access there on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| There are a number of things that are occurring as part of this overall thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| I think, again, the important thing is the piece of property has been there for quite some time with nothing happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| but for my client's involvement, we wouldn't have gotten this far in this process to deal with the county getting some money for going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2222)|
| 0:37:17| Any other questions, I'd be happy to try to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| Yes, Mr. King, this is for everyone that's a long time around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| This is the old Double D Western store that sat there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| We've been wanting and wished that we had, on at least two occasions, a Cracker Barrel that was going to go into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| I've got a feeling that the reason they didn't was because of this access control problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| It is for one of these but-for situations that we'll have to look at come Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| This piece of property needs to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| The on-ramp from John Sevier to Chapman Highway, we'll not be able to get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| That's probably going to have to be improved for the access on the Chapman Highway side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| So, there's a lot that can-we're growing in South Nauvoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| We're going to grow our businesses and we're going to grow our families and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| I'm for the development, but I want to make sure that we cover our sales as a county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| to make sure that our investment comes out as a wise investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| Well, just remember that, in essence, we're producing the funds for you to, in turn, do that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2305)|
| 0:38:35| It's not like we're coming in and asking for you all to come up with the $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2315)|
| 0:38:44| It's maybe not proper, but the easiest way to think of it is it's a $260,000 windfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2324)|
| 0:38:54| a portion of which is going to go into needed infrastructure changes and improvements at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2334)|
| 0:39:05| I guess I need a clarification, Dan, from Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| First, we were going to accept the money from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Now we're going to accept the money directly from Mr. King's-the owners of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| Do we-and Mr. King made the point that they're going to do all the work themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| So, really, is there still a need for this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| If they're going to take those funds themselves and do it to do that, are they wanting-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| I've got a feeling it's going to be more than $260,000 worth of improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| They just want to use that $260,000 to us as improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| Anything over $260,000, Mr. King's client will take over, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| A yes or no could be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| The request that they've asked for is $200,000 of the $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| If I could back up just a little bit, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| the state's position, based on federal guidance, is pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| The funds that were paid to the property owner at the time, and I think it was 1974 for the loss of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| were paid by Knox County to that property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Knox County subsequently turned the property over to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| and the state did their transportation improvement projects, and that involves federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| and that's where the federal standard comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| It is both the state's understanding and our understanding that since Knox County compensated the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| for the loss of access at that time, that Knox County would be the party to receive that compensation back for the regain of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2439)|
| 0:40:48| So those funds actually would not be paid to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| They would be paid directly to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| That makes sense. That wasn't there, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Yeah, John King, if you don't mind, or Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| So am I looking at the right parcel, 7550 Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| I don't remember what the address is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Are there three parcels put together out there, and you're buying all three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Ultimately, there are three parcels, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Okay, and you're buying that group of parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Right, but I think this request really only relates to two parcels of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| The ones that are in holding by the bank, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Okay, so what improvement, and I guess the mechanism for this is kind of different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| They're going to pay us $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| How do we P.O. out $2,000, purchase order out $2,000 when it's not on our property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2499)|
| 0:41:49| Our thought is that the utility relocations would be work that was done in the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| The access ramp or access road that's described in the agreement is also public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| To the extent that it is possible in a project like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| we would prefer that all of the work that is supported by these funds be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| or utilized for those portions of the project that are off of Mr. King's client site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| and exist within the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| We think probably with utility relocations and extensions that that's going to be easily possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| We think we'll cross that $200,000 threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| and once we've met that $200,000 threshold, Mr. King's clients would cover the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| I guess my question is, what other projects in the county do we pay utility relocation on a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| that doesn't have anything to do with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| I'm just trying to make sure that we can legally give this guy $200,000 to move utilities to improve his own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| I would defer to the law director on that, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| It's an interesting question, and again, this is what both Mr. King and I have spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| The thing I think that sets this one apart and the reason we wanted to get it before this body is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| in this case, in effect, they are bringing their own money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| Had Mr. King showed up with his clients and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| look, this is an expensive undertaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| and we need you to find $200,000 of public money or from one of your other projects and support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| we would have said, boy, it's great to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you for stopping by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| In this case, we have this additional element of these funds that we are going to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| as a consequence of the development that we will not receive otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| I'm not questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| I think it's going to be a great development, but how does this set the precedent of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| This is a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| This is not something that's going to come up, or it's never come up before, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| and I don't want it to come up again where we're improving somebody else's property with the money they're paying us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| We agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| It's an unusual space, and again, we would want to defer to the law director's guidance and commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| because, frankly, we don't have any commensurate experience with this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| It's one of the reasons that we have a lot of questions and not a lot of recommendation for the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| because I've never seen this come up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| So how do we cut a check for $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| At what point do we cut that check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| There's no process for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Mr. King, you wanted to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| It's just a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Well, first of all, taking your last point of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| the agreement provides that there will be no payments, no reimbursement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| no payments made by the county except upon receipt of acceptable documentation, be it invoice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2679)|
| 0:44:49| whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| and the type of improvements for which there will be some payment is likewise set out in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2692)|
| 0:45:03| He has described stuff that's in the public right of way and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| Under the terms of the agreement, whenever the sum of $200,000 expenditure by the county is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2710)|
| 0:45:19| then the agreement terminates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| If the project is completed and yet the expense to the county has not been as much as $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2722)|
| 0:45:33| in that circumstance it likewise terminates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| And the agreement calls for the funds to be accepted and managed by the county for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2737)|
| 0:45:50| When this whole thing started, there was a meeting with members of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2750)|
| 0:46:02| and administration, including the county mayor's office and Daniel Sanders from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2762)|
| 0:46:14| That question was asked at the time, and I think the acknowledgement by the county law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| at that time was much the same as here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| It's an unusual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| But if the parties are in agreement, then, yes, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| I'm the one that's been primarily, I guess, appointed or by default, whatever, put in charge of preparing the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2795)|
| 0:46:46| to reflect that agreement as a three-way agreement to make sure that the state understood where the money was going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2806)|
| 0:47:00| Where is this agreement we speak of, because it's not in our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| It will be, well, I beg your pardon, it may be my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2824)|
| 0:47:17| I mean, it's my part that you all don't have it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| That's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| We can't approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| I mean, the resolution looks good, but there's no agreement in our resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| And I just want to make sure the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| The reason you don't have it is that as late as about 4 o'clock this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| I was talking with the title attorney, Joe Huey, on this matter to make sure there's an exhibit that's to be attached to the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2858)|
| 0:47:49| to make sure that that was the exhibit that everybody agreed on that showed the location of the access and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2869)|
| 0:47:59| I promised everybody, starting right after that conversation, that they'd have the agreement by tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| Well, in the agreement, I'd like to know what is spelled out specifically what we're purchasing or what we're giving $200,000 for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2886)|
| 0:48:16| I want it to be very specific, and I want it to be all right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| because really this guy's buying a piece of property that's encumbered and expecting us to help unencumber it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| And so I think everything needs to be in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| Everything needs to be public improvement, not just for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| I think what you're going to find there will be a description of the type of expenses to be dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2910)|
| 0:48:41| and they are for improvement to or movement of things that are in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| and creation of some additional lanes of traffic, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| That's what you're going to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| I think there's about maybe five or six specific items, types of items that are to be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2938)|
| 0:49:07| There is sort of a catch-all provision at the end that any other expense of like kind is approved by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2947)|
| 0:49:20| so that if there's something else that comes along that we don't currently know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| we can ask and if the county agrees, they could maybe pay on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| The maximum under any circumstance or event, the maximum the county would ultimately be paying is $200,000 out of the $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2970)|
| 0:49:44| Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| We had an understanding there was an MOU out there, which we haven't seen yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| I would recommend, I know we've changed the caption once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| but I think I would recommend another change to the caption, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| whereby we're approving the MOU which will address the expenditure of $200,000 for these utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3003)|
| 0:50:12| so that this commission can know with specificity what they're voting on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| We, meaning the Law Director's Office, need a copy of that pretty quick so that we can do our due diligence before next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3020)|
| 0:50:28| I thought you were going to have it this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Well, I had a note down here that I was going to get it, and I had John King, MOU, but I haven't had a chance to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3032)|
| 0:50:41| I apologize. I'd say my hope exceeded my ability to produce this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| So anyway, I would, whoever the motion people are, I would request that the approving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3047)|
| 0:50:55| instead of authorizing expenditure, approving a MOU for the expenditure, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3055)|
| 0:51:03| Could that be made as a friendly motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| As an addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| Dwight, Mr. VanVate, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| Looking at this map here, this layout, is all those improvements, are they in the right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| Let me, the sketch was prepared by Mr. Snowden, Mr. Chairman Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| so let me defer to him and let him speak to the sketch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Next time we've got a picture to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Let me look at the sketch and verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| And my question was, is most of this improvement that we're looking at in here, is that in the right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| I think you should have a color copy of that, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| The areas highlighted in blue and red are all within the state and county public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3128)|
| 0:52:19| Blue and red, okay, so that's all in the public right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| So we're not improving private property, we're improving public property, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| That works in the right of way, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Quick question for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Are you on a deadline or are you willing to look at a 30-day postponement if necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| Are you on a deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| I'm for it, you know, just as long as we get these questions answered in the correct way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| to the satisfaction of the law department and this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| Commissioner, I've been at this long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| I don't like to push things when somebody up there doing their due diligence needs more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3181)|
| 0:53:11| but I have a very strong preference in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| We have spent a total of probably right at, well, better than a year and a half dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3197)|
| 0:53:27| We have extended options on this a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| We have one prospective good tenant that has already taken themselves out of the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3211)|
| 0:53:41| We might be able to bring them back, but we really, really need to move forward with this if it's at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3221)|
| 0:53:49| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| I know the property very well, and we need to get that developed so the rest of it will develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| We'll hear it Monday, just get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| I really hate to ask a question not knowing the answer, but Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| There are no longer dollar signs in the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| MOU is in the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| We've amended the motion to include both language for how the money is transferred to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| and that it is to include the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| So back to the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| It's $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| The party of the first part is going to give us, Knox County, $260,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| and we're only going to give them $200,000 back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| I can't see the discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3291)|
| 0:55:00| I think what Commissioner Anders is wanting to make sure we do this properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| and don't get ourselves in trouble with any auditors or the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| As stated, what we have before us is Resolution 406 amended to include language of both an MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| and how the money will transfer to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| The motion is to pass with no recommendation until our regular work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| The ayes have it unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| Item number 42 is a resolution approving accreditation agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| with Knox County Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| and the American Public Works Association for the county will pay $20,000 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| other incidental expenses for the Accreditation Review Resolution 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| Dwight, did we ever get in all the documentation on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| No, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| I appreciate the move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| If we could just sit in with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| We're still waiting on a couple tweaks to the agreement from the American Public Works Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| but we should be ready to go Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| We're excited about it, and I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| But if we are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| we will be only the second public works agency in the state of Tennessee to become accredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| Can I get a substitute motion to approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| I'm going to change my motion to sit in with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Second. Anybody got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Okay. So the motion before us to approve Resolution 407| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3395)|

| 0:57:25| Yeah, quickly, Matt, will you come down and explain this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I called Matt. Mr. Myers, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Would you explain what this was and why I asked the question and why we need a moving company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| A few years ago, we did have to move a clerk's office and a sheriff's office in halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| We moved them down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| We didn't have anybody on contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| We have also moved a clerk's office from East Town over to the old Markman's building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| We do get calls here and there for moving services, which we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| It's no secret that we potentially have a large school administrative office to move in the next however many months that can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3485)|
| 0:58:16| We're trying to be proactive instead of reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| One more question, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Was this a multiple response or does Armstrong get the only response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| If we're going to move a couple of 300,000 or 400,000 square feet, is that the only response we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| We had two responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| In looking at the difference in the price, it was almost double for the second bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| Thank you. I was just making sure. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| We have a proper motion and second before us to approve Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| No say opposed. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Item number 52 is a resolution approving a lease agreement with the high school community organization for the operation of a community center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3538)|
| 0:59:07| in Knox County property located at 1708 West Emory Road with an annual rent of $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| Resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| Let me tell you about this property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| We've got additional equity on it, so that dollar was well invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| The motion before us is to approve Resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| The motion carries. Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Item 53 is a resolution regarding the assurance of not to exceed $62,380,000 general obligation refunding bonds of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3586)|
| 0:59:59| Resolution 805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| Mr. Baker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Yeah, Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Does everybody understand what's going on with the refinancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| My question is we borrowed $90 million six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| We're borrowing another $62 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| No, not borrowing anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| We're refunding two previous issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| But you're borrowing money to refund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Borrowing money to pay off money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| So at the point you're borrowing money before you can repay that money, do you follow me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3652)|
| 1:01:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Does that then increase what our bond debt is right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Because right now it's about $662 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| If you added another $62 million on top of that, that's about $725 million before you can do a refund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3669)|
| 1:01:19| Am I looking at this the right way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| No, I think the timing is simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| So I don't think there's – am I right, Jeremy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| So it never comes – it never appears that our bond debt increased over $700 million then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| That is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I'll let him speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| Joe Ayers with Cumberland Securities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| When we do a refinancing, the proceeds of the new refinancing bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| they go into what's called an escrow trust agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| where those proceeds are invested in the United States Treasury securities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| until the bonds can be redeemed from the existing bondholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| So when those bonds are what we call legally defeased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| so those come off your balance sheet as a liability of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| So you do not count them twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| And this refinancing is simply being done to create somewhere between $5.5 million and $6 million of savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| by taking the average interest rate on the old bonds from around 4% to about 2.5% on the new bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| Okay. And that $5 million will be paid out over what time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| That savings is generated over the next, looks like about 17 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3744)|
| 1:02:33| to the tune of $330,000 per fiscal year worth of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3753)|
| 1:02:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| What were the terms, the length of maturities on the two bond issues that we are refinancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3763)|
| 1:02:51| They were 20-year bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| How far in were we into those maturities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| They were issued in 2013, and one of them was issued in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| So we are seven years into one of them and four years into the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| And what length of term did we put on maturity on these new bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| They're the same maturities as the old bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| We're doing what we call maturity-to-maturity refinancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| There's no extension of the debt, no shortening of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| You're just lowering your annual payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| much like if you went and refinanced your home mortgage from a higher rate to a lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| What was the spread in interest rate between the two bond issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| About 150 basis points, or 1.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| Okay. Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| And then the cost to do all this is just over half a million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| Projected cost, yes, sir, that looks like about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| And the savings are net of all transactional expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| Don, did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| Go ahead. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| I said the savings are net of all the transactional expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| So the $5.5 million to $6 million are projected savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| Take into account all the cost of doing the refinancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| whether it's the types of expenses that Ms. Wicks was explaining about earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| or the cost to pay off the old bondholders through the refunding escrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| Okay. Sounds like a good deal to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| And as usual, assuming this body authorizes the mayor and the finance director to proceed with the refinancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| if something should happen in the bond market and the savings are not achievable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| we just don't go through with the refinancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| It gets canceled and put up on the shelf for a future day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| And thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Chris, do we have any other debt on our balance sheet coming up over the next five or ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| that might be appropriate for another round of refinancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| Where are we on that as we look to the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| This is a good deal for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| But as we look at our total balance sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| are there any other opportunities similar to this to refinance any other existing debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| There will always be opportunities, we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| I think Joe and I talk fairly often and go through those processes and when they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| And he brings to us any opportunities that he sees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| As our financial advisor, that's what he does for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| And so we talk, and any time that we see an opportunity, we take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| And those do come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| I think with this issue, we will have done this three or four times in the last seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| and saved $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| There will probably be more opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| On our further discussion, we have a motion and a second before us to approve Resolution 805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=3942)|

| 1:09:23| Jennifer Roach, 1912 Shady Hollow Lane, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| I just haven't seen you guys and gals in a long time, so I wanted to come by and visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| But seriously, I really appreciate the opportunity to serve Knox County on the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| and look forward to serving a full term there and doing the best work we can for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| And that's all I have to say because I heard from the back row there that less is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| So I'll just say thank you and sincere appreciation for the opportunity to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4185)|

| 1:10:07| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4208)|
| 1:10:31| Item 67 is a discussion of the upcoming legislative delegation and commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| Would you guys want to go ahead and discuss this now or push this to next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| We don't have much next week, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| There's not much next week to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Yeah, let's push it to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| We'll push that to next week then, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Do we want to have a discussion about the employee policy handbook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| Do you want to push that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| Or do you want to have a discussion today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Well, I can provide a quick update for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| The committee that consisted of just this row right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| we met last week to discuss the employee handbook for the county commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| as well as, as a reminder for everyone, our audit committee actually works for county commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| Internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Internal audit committee team works for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| One of our recommendations is to adopt the recently approved handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| that was approved by the executive branch of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| probably with a couple of minor tweaks to reflect the hours worked by our office staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| to make sure that we're matching up to their reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| I believe you had a few suggestions on that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Yes, I also wanted to make sure that it still stayed intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| the way the hiring and firing is done in that office to keep politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| And also, since these are commission employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| that they are under the preview of not just the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| but that there is a system in place that gives commissions some say in how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| And I think if you blend the current policy that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| with the rest of the general county under the mayor policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| we'll be able to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| But we have to have something together and passed by next month's meeting, at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4344)|
| 1:12:33| So I think Mark Jones is more than willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| Mark Jones was part of the meeting, and he's more than happy to help us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| We won't need to come back to this next week, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| Commissioner Bussard, do you wish to talk about this today, or do you want to push this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Well, we've got three people out here sitting through all of our really exciting agenda sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| and I'd rather have them to go ahead and speak now instead of bringing them back next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| We have Mr. Alan Bull, Melissa Boone, and Courtney Levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| And, Alan, what I ask you here for is just to kind of get us up on when a call comes in to the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4409)|
| 1:13:39| I think there's like three calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| You have one for, like, police work, and then you have one for fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| and then you have one for, like, emergency service, like an ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| I've got them down to three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Are there more categories than that when they come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| Actually, we're handing out some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Pull the mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| We're handing out some information packages there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| We put together a small presentation to give you some idea of what we do and how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4444)|
| 1:14:14| If you want me to quickly go through that, I think it will probably answer most of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4454)|
| 1:14:22| I'll start with page number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Everyone knows the KCCD, North Dakota County Emergency Communication District, was brought about in 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| I'm going to paraphrase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| I'm not going to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| We were charged with providing emergency 911 telephone and access emergency dispatching services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| Page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| I think you've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| We answer a partial answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| We answer 911 lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| We answer police communication lines, sheriff's communication lines, other emergency communication lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| animal control lines, and after-hour KPD lines come in to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| In 2016, we took an average of 51,917 calls a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| Right now, we're taking approximately 95% of our calls coming in from cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| So the wireline days, we've made a complete transformation over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| What happens when a 911 call comes in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| I want to point out, because this question comes in a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| if you make a call to somebody and you hear ringing in your telephone, that ring is put on by your carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4537)|
| 1:15:45| In other words, if you have two people in the same room with different carriers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| you'll notice that when you call them, you'll hear it ring maybe three or four times, but yet they only heard it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| So when you call 911, just because it rang six or seven times to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| doesn't necessarily mean it rang on our end that many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| We use what's called ACD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| So when you call 911 that comes in, our system automatically distributes it to one of the call processors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| So it's not just up in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| When you call from a landline phone, if people still have landline phones, we get the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| All that is built into the system, so we get your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| When you call on a cell phone, we get a lat long, which is a compass heading, basically, of where you're calling from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4587)|
| 1:16:37| The FCC sets these rules, and they're trying to type them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| But basically right now we get 95% of the time within 100 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| The FCC has got rules they're coming out with to try to make the carriers pin it down even more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| but that 100 yards is quite a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| Alarm calls that we get, and this is one of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| if you wear a device around your neck where you push a button or so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| that is going to a third-party company, whatever company you've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| and then they're the ones that's calling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| So when it comes in to us, we're getting it from the alarm company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| So that doesn't come directly to 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| How fast do we answer calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Our overall average is .2 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| Does that mean we answer all calls in .2 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| No, but over that many calls, it's an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| There is times, and I know we get calls on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| If our call processors are taking calls and we have an in-progress call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| and we're having to stay on the phone with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| then obviously our average is going to go up at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| It says on here, like, you can imagine the number of calls we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| if there's a wreck on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| Now that everybody's got a cell phone, we're going to get 100 calls on one wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| That brings about, too, if a call comes in and we say we've already got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| and you say I haven't told you where it's at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| we probably know because if you're calling from the same place that the wreck is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| we probably know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| Page 8 is a picture of what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| We have three of these up on our wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| When calls are coming in and the call processors are answering calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| and we have more calls coming in than we're answering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| this will tell us and it will start blinking red and we hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| and that tells us that we need to be speeding things up as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| Page 9, one of the questions, how do we know what to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| and how do we know who to send and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| We operate in what's called a call handling guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| We sit down with the police department, sheriff's department, fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| and regular bases and they determine what they want us to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4729)|
| 1:18:57| and what order we want to ask it in and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| What we are asking, I think I'm getting ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| Okay, enough on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| But what we ask and how we ask it is determined by the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| In other words, the calls are determined by priorities set forth by the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4754)|
| 1:19:21| I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| I'm trying to hurry and get ahead of myself here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| The questions that we use to determine what involvement is involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| and so forth is the information we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| But one thing to keep in mind from a public point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| we're asking you all the questions that we need to ask, all that we're supposed to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| but as soon as we know where the incident is and what the incident is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| we have already sent that over by computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| We've already sent it over to dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| Dispatch is already calling the car, already making them aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| and then as the call processor is typing the information in, that information is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| So the fact that we're still on the line, still answering, asking you questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| it doesn't mean that we haven't already dispatched it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| because we get a lot of people saying, why are you asking me all these questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| Just so you be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Number 11 is an example of one of our call guides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| and as you can tell, it tells us what to ask, when to ask it, what order to ask it in, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| Page number 12 is an example of our dispatch console.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| That's what the dispatcher said, looking at six different screens and maps and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| I brought two ladies that can answer almost any question that you want to ask, no pressure on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4839)|
| 1:20:49| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Thank you for being here, Mr. Bull, and your other, I don't know what their titles are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| Melissa is operations manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| She's coming up through the ranks from all the way up to, Courtney is one of our shift supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| Well, we appreciate all of you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| And I've got a question about something you probably hate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| and I don't know if we're doing it yet or not, but it's texting into the 911 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| Is that happening yet, and is that coming, if not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| That's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| From a technical side, we are upgrading our phone switch literally, I think, next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| So the capability is there, technically, we'll be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| We are actually waiting until the state rolls it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| because when we switch over to next-gen 911, that's what that's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| we'll be on the state network that supplies the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| We are waiting for them to officially put it out since we're on their network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| We don't want to say, well, we're ready to go, let's go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| and then decide they're doing something on the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| But it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| It's very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| I can see where it could be helpful in a situation where a person is trying to hide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| from whatever is going on or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| but it's got to be very difficult to figure out how to communicate back with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| because the questions have got to be a lot more concise and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| It's new technology, new procedures, new SOPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| It does break down language barriers, because people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| we use language, line interpret, we'll be able to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| But going a step further from your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| the text is probably step one of next-gen 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| but the next thing is going to be video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| So we'll be able to accept video and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| And then from there, as the law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| and firefighters can appreciate, they've got computers in their cars now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| so in the future we'll have that capability of taking all these texts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| and pictures and all this data and pushing it right out to the car and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| So it's going to be a whole new learning curve for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| It's new technology, and that's where we're at, and it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| Five years ago I would have said it's coming, but it's actually here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| Vice Chair Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Mr. Bull, I sure do appreciate you coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| The main question I was asking about is when that call comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| and the questions you ask, then you have, I thought it was three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| but it looks like there's a little bit more complicated than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| But one would go to if all you're needing is a police response, you'd have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| If you need a fire response, you'd have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| And emergency service, and those little emergency buttons comes in from a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| They would come in from not 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| So you've got 911, you've got police, and you've got sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| and then you've got basically all the others that lump it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| But when that call comes in, we have the capability in our computer system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| where you call in as soon as we determine that you need law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| then of course our information, and let me say this, we ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| Even though we may have the answer, it may be right there on our screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| we're going to ask the question because sometimes technology is not 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| but I bet in your life that that screen's right, so we're still going to ask you where you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| As soon as we know that it's police or sheriff, whether it's in the city or the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| then our computer system is going to send it to the proper dispatcher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| all the information is going to be on screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Now you take the case that there's a wreck and the car's on fire and there's somebody hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| So the computer system is going to automatically, by us putting code on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| it's going to automatically send it to all three agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| It's going to send it to police, it's going to send it to fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| and it's also going to send it to AMR for the ambulance response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| So that's how it's determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| And all this is programmed in by the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| In other words, we sit down with them and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| if you get this type of call, send two cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| If you get this call, send a sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| On a wreck, you send one fire engine and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| So all that's determined ahead of time, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Again, going back to the emergency response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| I've had some people say that some of them are a lot older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| and they may punch that button by mistake or some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| How can they stop that call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Instead of sending some sort of resource out there to check on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| if they try to call, what's the answer to that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| If we get the call from, like, the alarm company or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| we're going to send the response down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| This is close to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| My mother, my 97-year-old mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| she sometimes accidentally hits the button by mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| and the alarm company is going to call her back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| First of all, they're going to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| we got an activation on your alarm and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| And she says, oh, I hit it by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Well, they're going to call us and tell us to cancel it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| So they will call you back even though, okay, it's what I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| Well, listen, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Oh, and thank you for coming and spending this great time with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| I know you were excited out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| I could see that you were just on the edge of your seat during all of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| But thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| Glad to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Yeah, I just wanted to kind of reiterate what I said a month or two ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| that I would strongly encourage you guys to go over and sit in the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| on a Friday afternoon or maybe during a football game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| and just kind of experience what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| You know, go anytime between 6 o'clock on Friday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| to 4 o'clock Saturday morning or Saturday into Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| You'll be overwhelmed by what goes on in that center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| and I think you'll get a better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| And it won't take as much time to explain everything as the process happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| It's a good experience to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| Courtney will actually give you a headset and put you to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| Thank you, Director Bull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Can you deactivate my key over there then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| I don't want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| And any of you is welcome anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| It goes without saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Just give me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5242)|
| 1:27:31| On page 11, item 71 is discussion to set a time for a public hearing on zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5251)|
| 1:27:40| I would suggest we do it like we're doing this one, immediately following a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5260)|
| 1:27:49| We have a short month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Does that leave us enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Mr. Law Director, do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| The work session in November is the 13th, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| 13th, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Because we move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| If you do that, you need to notice it pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| So we can set the time and go ahead and notice it now then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| So do I have a motion to have the hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| You don't have to do that on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| I don't think you have to have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| I'm getting used to what may be the new rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| I mean, you said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| If there's no objection, we'll set this meeting for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171016?start=5316)|
