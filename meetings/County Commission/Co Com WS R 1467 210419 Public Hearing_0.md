| 0:03:45| For the past 30 years, I've dedicated my life to public service, first as an educator in Knox County for 23 years, and then as a school board member for the past seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=225)|
| 0:03:57| In the last seven years especially, I've learned a lot about Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| Being retired, I had the time available to dedicate to the men and women at the Knox County Sheriff's Office as a merit council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=243)|
| 0:04:13| As with the current climate and as we witnessed tonight, I think there is no better time to get involved, to support, and to serve the men and women in the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=253)|
| 0:04:27| I've read through the policies and procedures governing the operation of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| I believe I can serve honorably with impartiality and integrity, and I would be honored to be considered for a position on the Sheriff's Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=274)|
| 0:04:47| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=287)|

| 0:04:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| Hey, Patty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Hey, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| I was really surprised to see your resume that you had put in, given that you were on the school board, the amount of work that's already on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=298)|
| 0:05:08| Could you please dive a little bit deeper into why you feel a calling to serve in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| And also, you said you read through the policies and procedures of the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| I'm sure you're aware there are some proposed changes that are being suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| I'd like to get your opinion on those changes also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=328)|

| 0:05:36| What I found in the policies and procedures governing the operation of the merit council was it was a very technical and detailed and precise document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=336)|
| 0:05:47| I found myself to have more time this year than I thought I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| School board does take a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Ms. Hill can attest to that, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| But I do find that I've had more time than I realized, and I felt like that it's a good time to get involved again in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=358)|
| 0:06:08| I saw the vacancies and I wanted to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| I spent a lot of time getting to know a lot of the men and women that serve in the sheriff's office over the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=373)|
| 0:06:22| and I would just like to support and serve them in fairness and impartiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Yes, ma'am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Are there additional questions? Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Excuse me. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Hi, Patty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| I guess my one question, and it'll be a question for all of them, is that I see the merit council as a nonpartisan, nonpolitical position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=399)|
| 0:06:52| Everything's politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| We all know that. Everything's politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| It boils down, and I've got a lot of e-mails and a few phone calls about what's happening now and what's happened in the past and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=416)|
| 0:07:05| My question to you is will you be fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| Will you stay out of the politics of the sheriff's department, the sheriff's braces and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| Because sitting there, you have got to look like when I was on the Board of Zoning Appeals with John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=437)|
| 0:07:26| We've got to look at the facts, the facts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| It's not who that person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| It's the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| I'd like you to kind of answer that question, how you would respond to when the sheriff's race is going to be heating up pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| So how do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| I think as a member of the Sheriff's Merit Council that it is imperative to stay out of politics and look at the facts only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| to look at the policies and procedures and to implement them as they are written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| I've built my life upon being a person of integrity and honesty, and I think I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| And back to Commissioner Smith's question, I am really good at time management, and I think that that's very key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=486)|
| 0:08:15| I do realize that I am serving currently on the school board, but that term is up at the end of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| so I only have one more year left on my current term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| And it's just a matter of prioritizing and being committed and making those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| and doing what you're called upon to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| Are there additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Thank you very much, Ms. Belz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| I'm going to stick around just in case there are some additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=529)|

| 0:20:53| We also drove 8,800 cookies to Baton Rouge and Dallas, where officers were gunned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| We started Cookie Crusaders so we could show our men and women in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| that we support them and wanted to be proactive to appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| I've worked extremely hard and fair for these men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| in the role that I currently serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1272)|

| 0:21:17| so we may move this council forward to continue to protect our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| and keep this council intact for the reason it was developed 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| I know, like you, that we appreciate our men and women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1286)|

| 0:21:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1300)|

| 0:21:45| I want to thank all these officers that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| and the ones that were here a while back and escorted those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1308)|
| 0:21:58| I've got to watch my words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I appreciate the officers dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| The number one thing, officers, safety, safety, safety, safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1324)|

| 0:22:14| I'll tell you right now, I wouldn't have your job anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| I don't have the personality to have your job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| but I still wouldn't have your job at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| I've got two questions for you. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| The first one was about the politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Then I'll ask you the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Actually, I said on the Merit Council in the election, the sheriff's election 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| that was not something I got involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Actually, in our rules and ordinances, we're not allowed to get involved in the sheriff's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| If you sit on the council, so that's not something that has been done by me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| and it wouldn't be something that would be done this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| I want to thank you for running for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| You know, you've got a taste of what public office is, the emails, the phone calls, everything at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| The Sheriff's Merit Council is under commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| I'm not saying that we tell you all what to do, but we do approve the rules and everything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| That being said, have you in a year from now, when a seat opens up on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| do you have any plans on running for a commission seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| and then we'd have to turn around and reappoint someone else because you couldn't hold two positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| I can't say that I can make that decision right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| The opportunity is there, but I can't say that I'm, you know, have that right now that I'm doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1414)|
| 0:23:45| Commissioner Smith, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| I think I know the answers to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Ms. Oster, just recently, I'm not sure if you were chair or not before when this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| but a case came up from one of the employees of the Knox County Sheriff's Office, Ms. Martha Dooley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1443)|
| 0:24:12| and that was a case that was filed as a grievance with the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| You're familiar with the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| The Knox County Law Department, it's my understanding that they advised the Merit System Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| that this case was not something that was allowable to be heard under the structure of the merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| yet the Merit System Council, which you're a member of, decided to hear it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Could you help me understand why you and the other members would go against the law department in that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| I actually wasn't chairman at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| We did vote to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| I don't know if you understand the steps that our employees have to go through to be able to file a grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| Mr. Buke did opine on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| Mr. Valiant has also opined on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| So attorneys tend to have two different opinions about things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| and if she's gone through the appropriate steps to get to us for a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| then we felt that that was appropriate to be able to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Even if the counsel for the Merit Council, your own lawyer, said that this is not something that should be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| There again, we had two opinions, and this isn't something, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| we'll be talking about this on Wednesday in our meeting, and you're welcome to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| but this isn't something that I'm going to play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| This is going to be done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Are you aware that by making that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| it's forced the Knox County Law Department to hire outside counsel and spend over $30,000 so far to hear that case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| That wasn't up to the counsel to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| That was up to the sheriff and to the law department to hire Mr. Prince.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| They could have used the counsel that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| They have three on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| They could have used one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| But you're aware that those actions have now resulted in over $30,000 in tax credit dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| I am very aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| I promise you I am more aware than you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| This is something I deal with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| Are there other questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1579)|

| 0:26:21| Can we ask all other candidates if they're seeking office as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419-public-hearing?start=1588)|
