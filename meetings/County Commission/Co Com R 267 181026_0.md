| 0:00:30| Okay. Good afternoon. Welcome everybody to this specially called meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=30)|
| 0:00:45| Thank you for your interest. Just a couple of housekeeping items on this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=45)|
| 0:00:51| Number one, as we know, the meeting was called by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| He has the absolute right, based on state law, to call to other meetings such as this of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| When I posted the announcement of this meeting, I cited the law specifically just for as much as this group here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| but also to inform the public about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| That does give him the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| Secondly, I thought it would be appropriate, as the mayor called this meeting to order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| to ask him to open the meeting with a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| Third, after review with the clerk's office, when we posted this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| and based on all of our rules and the agenda that we posted for this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| we did not include in that agenda a public forum component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| I've had a few folks mention to me that they would wish to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| But we do have, on the agenda, discussion after the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| so there may be an opportunity there, as this body deems appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| during their discussion on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| But just wanted to go over those housekeeping issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| Also, finally, on a somewhat, not really a related note, just this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| I know Commissioner Daley is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| His wife had an accident last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| She broke her jaw and has had surgery this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| And just before this meeting, I heard when the accident happened last night and heard back from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| She's had surgery today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| And I think that may have been one of the reasons why they were not able to make it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| So with all that said, what I'd like to do is I'm going to read for the record item number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| We have called this meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| I'm going to ask the clerk's office to call roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| and then I will have the clerk's office read item number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=169)|

| 0:02:53| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=173)|

| 0:03:05| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=185)|

| 0:03:07| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=187)|

| 0:03:09| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| What I'd also like to do is ask the clerk's office if you could please read item number two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| that we will be acting on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| To discuss, address, consider, and approve or disapprove by vote resolution of litigation known as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| transfer court for Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| It's Knox County, Tennessee plaintiff versus Knox County Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| And Lisa Bigwood, Robert Caldwell, Stella A. Catlett, Gregory Craig, Gregory A. Gass, James Pitcher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=212)|
| 0:03:45| Renee Ricker, Benefice Chauffeur Dennis Riker, and David Yokely and James Carson individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=225)|
| 0:03:56| And pursuant to Tennessee rule of civil procedure 23 as class representatives from all other similarly situated defendants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=236)|
| 0:04:05| number 195629-1 and any and all related litigation related to the UOP participation and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=245)|
| 0:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| As all of you know and as the clerk read, over the past several months, Knox County has been suing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| Knox County Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| As of the end of last month, this lawsuit has cost the taxpayers of Knox County over $650,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=273)|
| 0:04:43| There is a settlement that was put forth by the Knox County Pension Board in my capacity as mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| and authorized by my ability and power to sign contracts under the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| I signed that settlement and presented it to the court in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| Chancellor Weaver on October 15th considered that settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| The reason that we're here is he indicated that he would like to hear from the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| and what their position on this matter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| So before you, you have a resolution which will dismiss with prejudice the UOP lawsuit and stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=314)|
| 0:05:24| The reason this had to be done tonight, this special session, is because we have another hearing on October 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| which is this Monday, and the chancellor needs this in his possession to consider the entire facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=331)|
| 0:05:39| and the totality of this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Thank you all very much for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Moving on our agenda, the next item is discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| Within the commission, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Commissioner Busler and then I see Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Go ahead, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| I need to make this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| I put it in writing and normally I don't do this, so I'll make sure it comes out clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| This is about the uniformed officer's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Commissioners, when I received the request for this special call meeting, I began to research many documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| as I knew that six of my fellow commissioners felt that this item needed to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| I began looking for reasons to approve, and after many hours of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| I've come to the conclusion that I need to make the following statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| Before I start this comment, I need to make knowing that I recognize the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| and the indispensable service provided by uniformed officers of the Office of Knox County Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| who place their lives on the line daily to protect and serve the citizens of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=421)|
| 0:07:10| My concern points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| The judge's statement said it is indisputable that neither notice nor consent have been given or obtained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=434)|
| 0:07:23| The sole question is one of law, whether the accrued lien cash payout may be included in the pension board's calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=443)|
| 0:07:35| All the parties I see that had agreed a few months ago to refer to a judge for resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=455)|
| 0:07:45| In four days we are to hear from the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| We also have that date of November the 12th that was also posted as the declaratory date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=468)|
| 0:07:57| Since there was an earlier agreement to have the judge to rule on the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=477)|
| 0:08:05| why can't we wait for the ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| There appears to be an optic of what's the rush to judgment other than additional attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=488)|
| 0:08:18| In the document here, notice of First Amendment to 2017 Statement of Knox County Uniformed Officers Pension Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=498)|
| 0:08:30| Quote, whereas Knox County Retirement and Pension Board has the right at any time to modify, alter, or amend the UOP in hold or in part by instrument in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=510)|
| 0:08:44| duly executed in accordance with the provision of Knox County Charter UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| If the board had this right to perform as stated, then why isn't the plan being amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| But until now, why wasn't it amended in 2008 or five years ago or two years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=538)|
| 0:09:07| This would have avoided the attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| In my view, in opinion, I am not convinced that the board has the authority to modify or alter or amend the plan at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=552)|
| 0:09:25| Quote, whereas required by UOP, the actuary has advised that the amendment will have no adverse actuarial impact on the county, the system, or UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=565)|
| 0:09:42| and based on the advice of the board, has concluded that this action will not increase funding or financial obligation of the county with the meaning of Charter Section 704E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=582)|
| 0:10:02| In reviewing the plan of the UOP, I followed the calculation guidance, also taking into consideration the addition of the 43 days of unused vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=602)|
| 0:10:20| If the 43 days of unused accrued bonafide vacation leave cash out is included, then my calculations indicate there could, would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=620)|
| 0:10:33| potentially be anywhere from $40 to $60 million in increased costs to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| Legal fees paid to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| In my understanding, there has been approximately, now I find out, nearly $600,000 in fees will be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=644)|
| 0:10:51| Who paid this and where did the funds come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| I don't believe the county has paid this, so did the payment come from the pension fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| I'm not certain, but the optics are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| Finally, I would like to address the thoughts about where we are in the charter guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=669)|
| 0:11:19| I'm proposing comments to that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| Based on my opinion, on review of the charter and the state constitution and elected officials, before us right now is a resolution that directs the county law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=686)|
| 0:11:39| and his designates to dismiss with prejudice all litigation regarding uniformed officers pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=699)|
| 0:11:50| By law, I don't believe we have the authority to reduce any elected officials enumerated authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=710)|
| 0:12:00| By law, I don't believe I have the authority to approve a document that would include wording that makes a determination of questions that is being litigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=720)|
| 0:12:10| before a judge in four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| By law, can I only approve or pass or even vote on the legislation, either a yes or no, that would include wording referring that I have the power to overrule the duties of a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=734)|
| 0:12:31| Remember, the judge already has instructed that the question is one of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=751)|
| 0:12:40| Having stated above, I know I will be in direct conflict with guidance set forth by the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=760)|
| 0:12:50| I feel if I vote yes or no, I will be in direct violation of my oath to Knox County Commission and the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=770)|
| 0:13:01| I felt that if I vote, I could be charged with an illegal act in acting against the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=781)|
| 0:13:15| So therefore, Mr. Chairman and Madam Clerk, I respectfully notify you to mark me absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=795)|
| 0:13:23| I will not be a party of this illegal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| I will leave now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=808)|
| 0:13:40| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Go ahead and note his departure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Next is Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I am a member of the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board, along with other colleagues on this panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| And I, during our meeting on Monday, we received a very good and comprehensive presentation of information by Mr. Chuck Burks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=838)|
| 0:14:09| And I would like to call on him, with your permission, to outline that presentation that's been provided to all of our commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| and give him an ample amount of time to be able to give that appropriate amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| You can call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Mr. Burks, could you please come and state your name and address and also explain your relationship to both the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| My name is Chuck Burks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| My address is 3919 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| I practice law here in Knoxville with the firm of Justice Nolan Burks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| and I am co-counsel for the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board in this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=886)|
| 0:14:55| As Commissioner Jay just said, we did have a meeting last Monday on the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| and we did make a presentation along other things that we had done on behalf of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=901)|
| 0:15:10| And the question that has been tossed around and talked about is the question about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| or not the cash leave out for vacation pay is or is not something that is a part of the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=917)|
| 0:15:27| And so my presentation will address that issue with your permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=927)|
| 0:15:36| To give you a little bit of background about this issue about the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| I think you can go back originally to the Private Act of 1967, and I'm going to go slow in order to go fast, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=943)|
| 0:15:55| In that Private Act, it set up and established your pension board for all the pensions in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=955)|
| 0:16:04| And one of the things that that Private Act gave the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| was the language that it empowered it to define all terms, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| The pension board is authorized to define all terms to these pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| Now, in 1988, there was a vote that Knox County would become a charter county ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| and that was approved in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| And in the charter, you have the fact that it adopted the 1996 Private Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=991)|
| 0:16:45| So that survived the charter, and so the pension board currently still has the empowerment to define all terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| Now, in 2006, and I'll ask you if you would, I put a handout to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1014)|
| 0:17:02| Could I ask, am I limited on time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Actually, I just wanted to track amount of time, so the clock will renew when it gets down to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| But I don't want to see it go over ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| And I'll try to keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| If you'll open your packet and take a look at the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| the first page is a copy of the 2006 ballot that established the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| And in that, there were about three important matters that are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| First of all, the plan had to be a qualified tax plan, and that means it had to be qualified with the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| and it had to be able to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| It also talked about that they would pay a certain amount of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Now, in the ballot, it uses the word payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| In the resolution that's on the next page, it uses the term salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| and that's sort of the beginning of some of the issues that we have regarding this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| So as a result of the passage of that ballot, the UOP plan was adopted, and it's called the 2007 UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1084)|
| 0:18:13| and you'll see that about three pages down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| And in the 2007 UOP, the retirement board uses the term compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| and it talks about what is compensation that will be attributable to the compensation that's pinchable in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1105)|
| 0:18:36| And if you turn to the next page, you see it's including compensation includes the post-severance compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| If you turn over the next page, 1.42, it defines post-severance compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| And post-severance compensation is payments made within two and a half months after severance from employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| if they are payments that, absent a severance from employment, would have been paid to the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| and employment for the employer and or compensation services as an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| What that simply means is that when an officer retires, his last paycheck actually comes after his termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| And on that last paycheck, he is paid his cash leave out of any unused vacation time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1157)|
| 0:19:26| And so under the IRS guidelines at this time that this was prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| that's the language that the IRS used of any compensation that one would receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| and that's why they had the two and a half months afterwards, because officers get paid after they actually retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| So that's part of the compensation that's included in the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| Now, something very interesting happened is that the IRS had their initial report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| and then on July the 1st, 2007, the very day that this came into effect, they had their final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1198)|
| 0:20:08| And the IRS's final report comes in and says that if you're going to include things like cash leave out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| vacation time, or any of these other times, in that regard, you have to actually put it in in writing in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| And so you have five years to put that in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| So the board, being cognizant of that, had a 2009, and that's the next plan that you have, 2009 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1226)|
| 0:20:38| And if you'll look at that, the 2009 plan, again, it defines compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| It then also defines that that includes post-severance compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| And if you turn the next page or two, they even refer to a 415 compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| 415 compensation is IRS language for compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| And then you go to the next page, 142, post-severance compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| and again, you'll see that definition in that first paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| And then you go over, and the next page, you see it's 6.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| It says final section 415 regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Again, what the board is saying is now that we have the IRS regulation that we have to call it the cash leave out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1281)|
| 0:21:31| you have to actually have it in your document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Then you look at 6.6, and you turn to the next page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| and in the 2009 UOP, it says under subparagraph two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| leave cash outs shall be included in 415 compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| If those amounts would have been included in the definition of 415 compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| if they were paid prior to the participant's severance from employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| and the amounts are payments, unused, accrued, bona fide, sick, vacation, or other leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| but only if the participant would have been able to use the leave if during the employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| So they put it in the 2009 specifically setting that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| Now, remember this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| In the very beginning, they have always paid the cash leave out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| It was part of the old program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| And when you look at the ballot from 2006 and 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| it actually says that we're going to do it just like we did it before under the defined benefit contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| So it's always been something that has been paid under the original 2007 and also under the 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1357)|
| 0:22:48| Then in 2012, we had a charter commission that meets periodically to look at our charter and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1368)|
| 0:22:57| And in that charter, they had decided and recommended that the 2007 UOP plan that we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1377)|
| 0:23:06| should be closed to any new officers that come into the plan as of January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1386)|
| 0:23:15| And so if you'll look at the charter review committee language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| it says that the 2007 officer's plan shall remain in effect for any officers who participate prior to January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1400)|
| 0:23:31| So in the charter provision, it's acknowledging the language and the provisions of the 2007 UOP plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1411)|
| 0:23:42| as amended through the process, which would be the 2009 that specifically has the language in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| And then if you go to the ballot for that change, you'll see a few pages over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1429)|
| 0:24:01| the ballot says that they're closing the present uniform officer's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| And the word present is important because, remember, the present plan is now the 2007 as amended by 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| that specifically has vacation cash leave out language in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| So not only did they do that, but there was a next you'll have a resolution by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1460)|
| 0:24:29| And this is an important factor that I think you need to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| And you'll see that it's R138901 is the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| It was approved on August 26, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| And in that resolution, if you'll turn over to the highlighted page, the third page over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1486)|
| 0:24:54| it says, whereas the board further, and this is the commission now, your commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| further amended and restated in its entirety the UOP effective January the 1st, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| So the county commission approved the 2014 UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| And it even goes down there and it talks further about the fact that the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Okay. Mr. Burks, you've got about another minute or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| I'm about to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| It further resolved the UOP plan, and you'll see that on the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| So the last thing I wanted to bring to your attention is the 2014 UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| This is what was approved, passed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| They had the actuary people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| They talked about the cost and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Again, if you'll turn at 1.19, compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| it includes the definition under the post-severance compensation shall be treated as compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| You turn over and you go to 1.75, the post-severance compensation paragraph, and it has a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1557)|
| 0:26:06| And then if you turn over to the next page, in the 2014 UOP plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| it says specifically leave cash outs shall be included in post-severance compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| if those amounts would have been included in the definition of compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| if they were paid prior to participant severance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| and the amounts are payment for unused, accrued, bona fide, sick, vacation, or other leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| but only if the participants would have been able to use it and leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| The county commission has already passed that language in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| That's already been resolved by the county commission, and it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| You look at the resolution that was approved for the actuary who came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| That's already the law in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| This language about cash leave out is, in fact, the current position of the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| Now, the UOP was changed one more time or amended in 2016, but those provisions were never changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| That is the current position that this body has already passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| and we simply think that that issue has already been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Next, I noted that Commissioner Gill, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| And after that, I believe Commissioner Biggs turned his light on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you, Mr. Burks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| And I'm going to ask a series of questions, and I just simply want you to help me walk through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| And I'm going to reference the page numbers from the documentation that you passed out under the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| So I want to start on page three to make sure that I understand, first of all, the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| But let me back up and say the language on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| So I'm on page two under A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Is this the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| No, I'm in the actual UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Under the UOP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Under the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| 2007 UOP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| This is the handout that you passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| So, and I just want to make sure as we move through a series of statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| in reference to what was just handed out, and so that the public can really follow along and understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| Because I want to make sure I'm following through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| So section A says the retirement board is hereby authorized and directed to establish, maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| and administer as a plan of the system a separate tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| and trust known as a UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| So that is part of where we are in answering this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| So the pension board has the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| So under page three in section C, it indicates that the officer's pensions shall be transferred together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1749)|
| 0:29:18| with all associated liabilities for benefits from any existing plan to the officer's pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| but not including balances resulting from rollover contributions or excess volunteer employee contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Down in section E, it says where the officer's pension from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| under this authority of section 604E, as long as it is amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| it is consistent with the terms set forth in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| I just want to make sure we're following along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Because when it comes to the section on page eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1799)|
| 0:30:08| this is where we're looking at section 1.42, that's a post-severance compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| So I just wanted to make sure we read this and make sure I'm on the same page as you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| Because it means this payment may, within two and a half months after severance from employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| within the meaning of this code, if they are those payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| that absence of severance from employment would have been paid to the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| while the employee continues in employment with the employer in our compensation for service as an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| And here is my last question and point, which moves to number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| And I'm going to be on page six and point eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Because when we look at the post-severance compensation on page eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| it indicates if this severance would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1865)|
| 0:31:15| So that's part of what we're trying to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| And I think if he or she is entitled to that compensation during their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1880)|
| 0:31:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| But they don't receive the funds until after they terminate, that's post-severance compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I just wanted to make sure that was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Because under 129 on page six, as long as your compensation is ended and you were in service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1901)|
| 0:31:52| those days are then factored in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Any other questions, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I wanted to ask about our actuarial values and if those compensate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| Does the current actuarial computations include the 43 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| The current actuarial compensation does include 43 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| And if I may just clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| In 2016, there was no number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| was the one that could dictate how much the officer would get his vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| It was brought to the board's attention that it was varying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| There were different amounts that different officers were getting based upon how much they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| It has to be a tax proper plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| It has to be a qualified plan under the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| If it's not qualified, then the county has to pay income tax on all of the monies earned off of this trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| and the officers may have to pay income if it's not a qualified plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| So we sat down and said, or we did, but the people at that time decided that 43 days was an amount that the other Knox County employees got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=1995)|
| 0:33:28| for their cash leave out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| So they wanted to make it uniform so it could be what's called a bona fide plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| Bona fide means it's consistent across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| So that's where the 43 days came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| To make it consistent, not only with the rest of the plans in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| but consistent with all of the officers in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| So that's why the 43 days, that's where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| And I will tell you that the retirement board has, on first reading last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| passed to amend the UOP to cap it at 43 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| That way it will not be controlled by various sheriffs when they come in and change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| And that's part of, I think, what the settlement plan addresses is to try to make that cap to make it a bona fide plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Well, you answered my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Next, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to restructure my question and statement and come back to you in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| So pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you, Mr. Burks, for coming and kind of explaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| This was probably the best five-minute, ten-minute, well, it wasn't five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Attorneys don't speak in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| But it was the best 15, 20-minute presentation that the pension board has gotten in explaining the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| and why we're here and where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| I think we're over, as a commission, or I think we're overstating this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2091)|
| 0:34:59| And when I say that, you know, this is not the law director doesn't have to drop the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| I mean, he's obviously said he's not going to, doesn't accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| But if the mayor and the commission show the judge some uniformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| and that's all the judge is asking for is how does the commission and the mayor feel as clients of the county law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2112)|
| 0:35:21| You know, this is not a binding statement to where, you know, if the law director doesn't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| the county commission can do anything, the mayor can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| This is a statement to the judge from this commission that we agree that this is actuarially funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| we think it's a sound plan, and that the pension board has gotten good, just legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| This is nothing more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| And so I think it's a well-thought plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| I just came on the pension board this September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| But I have kept up with this extensively because of the ramifications of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| If you go back to the Blackwell decisions, if you start clawing back into some people's pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| and Blackwell lawsuits start pouring into the county, we're not talking a couple of million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| we're talking tens of millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| And so I think this is a good, sound policy that's actuarially funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| And so I think I'm going to make a motion to approve the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| A motion has been made by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Actually, I believe I heard Commissioner Biggs a little quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| So a second has been made by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| So now we can have additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| So what we have, I'm glad that a motion was finally made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| What we have before us then is the paperwork of a resolution that I've seen several iterations of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2199)|
| 0:36:50| But what we're discussing is something that was just handed out again because it does not page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| It doesn't page number like the one I received in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| So my only question right at this moment is what is it that's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| Is it the one that I received e-mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| Is it the one I received in the mail from the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Or is it the one that was just handed out just now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| And let me be just a little bit more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| To see my, what was just handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2248)|
| 0:37:37| The one I received in the mail has all the signature block on the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| The one I received in the mail, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| The one that I just received now has the signature of the presiding officer of commission on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2266)|
| 0:37:56| Maybe it's just the way it was printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Different machine, different copier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| But I need to know which one I need to be paying attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| I believe the one, just to clarify, I believe the one that we were handed that has the memo on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2285)|
| 0:38:13| Well, this commission can decide which one that we're dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| That's up to this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| The one that we have in front of us, I see you're like Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| But currently, we have the ability to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| So if I'm listening to my fellow Commissioner Jay, the one we were just handed then is the one that we're talking to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2309)|
| 0:38:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| That's how this commission can vote on a resolution that they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| And I believe Commissioner Anders made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| So to clarify on your motion, the proper way would be to clarify which one of these that we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2327)|
| 0:38:57| Give me just a second to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Come back to me and let me look at the differences in the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Is it just a signature line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Is there a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I think we need to have the clerk to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Major factors under number two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Would you like to go ahead and just read this for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| directing the Knox County Law Director and his designates to dismiss with prejudice our litigation regarding the uniformed officer's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| This is Resolution R-18-10-101-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2369)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| And for Commissioner Wright, that was the one that was just handed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Commissioner Wright, you've still got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| Commissioner Gill, you had had your light on a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| Do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| I'm going to go back to Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| I believe you had had your light on earlier and wanted to make a statement that you were reevaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Come back to me in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| The chair recognizes Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Then back to the resolution that is before us, requested by Mayor Jacobs, prepared by John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2425)|
| 0:40:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Mr. Valiant, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| I thought I saw him earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| I saw Mr. Valiant earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| He prepared this paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| I wanted to make sure this is the paper that's before us, and I need to ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| Is Mr. Valiant in the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| It appears that he is not in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2467)|
| 0:41:23| I'm at a loss as to what I should do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| And let me, now someone may be looking for Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| Let me be adamant in the statement that I'm about to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| The assembly that is here today could be no more appreciated by anyone in Knox County than by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2499)|
| 0:41:53| I've sat here on this side ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| Let me back up just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| I spent 33 years at the other end of Gay Street with AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| A couple of three years out of AT&T in retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| I was unhappy with what was taking place in Knox County government and sought the position of being commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2534)|
| 0:42:26| And during all of this time that I've been here in this building, that I've been a member of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2546)|
| 0:42:35| and I can remember when uniformed officers delivered to my personal residence the agenda of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2555)|
| 0:42:46| That's way before zeros and ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| It goes back a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| I remember within the first few months of being on Knox County commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| the sheriff invited the new commissioners to the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2580)|
| 0:43:09| And I say this in all humor because it just sticks with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| About the first words I heard at the desk was, you've been here before, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| I say that humorously because, no, I had never been to the Knox County detention facility before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2604)|
| 0:43:33| Now, there have been people come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| This is a workaday life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| An officer of Knox County, a uniformed officer of Knox County, has no more difficult job than anyone in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2621)|
| 0:43:51| And I appreciate you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| I appreciate you being here this evening to hear the words of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| And one of the most important words that I want you to hear is from about two weeks ago or a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| we had a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I ask if the Knox County Law Department had reviewed a resolution that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2649)|
| 0:44:20| I ask if the Knox County Law Department had reviewed a resolution that was before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2660)|
| 0:44:31| I was quoted in the local paper as, did the Knox County Law Director approve the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2671)|
| 0:44:46| That really upset me because that's not the question I ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| And I was cast in a light then that was bad, according to my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| And my staff gives me some pretty strong sermons every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| That's my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| That was a single word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| I received an email in between that meeting and the next meeting asking why I asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2710)|
| 0:45:21| had the Knox County Law Department prepared the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| That in no way was correct either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| But the employee, the uniformed officer that called me, appeared to be misinformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2731)|
| 0:45:41| I pause for just a second to say, again, thank you for the work that you do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2741)|
| 0:45:51| Sometimes people hear me, there are no more important people in Knox County than teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2751)|
| 0:45:59| Teachers have a calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| No one teaches except those that want to go to the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| It's like my pastor, he was called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Teachers were called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| And that also applies to law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| You wouldn't do this except you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| And for that very reason, I have to say thank you again because you're what stands between me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| between this commission, between the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| You stand between us and bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Now then, back to the resolutions before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you for allowing me to, thank you, Mr. Chair, for allowing me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| I have a question for the preparer of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| I'll call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Is John in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| I heard someone pass me a note that said he was on his way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Commissioner Wright, if this is okay with you, I have heard that John is on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Would you like to hold the floor or would you like me to go to another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| I do not wish to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| We can come back to you when John comes back, if that's agreeable to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| I know that Commissioner Zane, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| So I'll go to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| I have a question for the law director, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| You had passed out this before we came here, and I want to direct your attention to page 2, paragraph 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| which says from 1988 to 2012, in regard to section 102 of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2844)|
| 0:47:31| On down it says, in August, the Charter Commission recommended amendment to section 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| I have here the November results from the charter questions in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| I can't find on here any charter amendment question that addressed anything in 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| There were seven different county charter questions that were on that ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| I'll have to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| I might be a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| The bottom, the essence of the memo, though, is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| Okay, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Before that period of time, there was opportunity for the commission and the mayor to have a say in terms of litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2885)|
| 0:48:17| After the charter amendment in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Again, I can't find that on 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| It's in the charter in a footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| That's where I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| I didn't go back to all the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| If I can copy the seven questions that were on the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| And then you go on to say since August 2012, section 102 has included important limitations on the authority of the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| and the commission with regard to private and local affairs, all lawful powers vested with the Knox County mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| and the commission in Knox County except those reserved to the judiciary for duties like the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Is that a certified copy of what was on the ballot in 2012?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| I didn't look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| It says it's in Exhibit F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| The first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| It's from Jeff Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| I'm reading to you out of what's actually in the charter and what is currently being used as a Knox County charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2946)|
| 0:49:15| That's where that information came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| My question to you is was there something on the 2012 charter amendment questions, any of one of those sevens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| that had any effect on one charter, section 1.02?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| I'll have to research it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| I don't have it here before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| I see what you're saying here, but I don't have the information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| I do know that the court looked at this particular information in this specific case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2983)|
| 0:49:52| and has opined to that very fact of what I have given to you in that memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| Specifically, the Knox County charter signs the duties to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| execute and administer all of the legal affairs of Knox County, including litigation to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| Knox County Code, Tennessee, Particle 2.308D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| This duty, quote, according to the judge, is not assigned in whole or in part to any other county officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3019)|
| 0:50:29| So he says this is a duty alone to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| This is a question that is before us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| and what you're asking in your resolution is to direct the law director to execute a duty that is at his discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3036)|
| 0:50:45| not at commission's discretion, according to the judge in this very case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| So I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| I know that we have all these defense attorneys here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| and they are trying their case before commission and hoping that you will be the judge instead of the chancellor where this case is before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3059)|
| 0:51:08| I'm not going to participate in litigating this case in a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| I don't think it's proper, and I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| Monday is the day that we will speak before the judge in anything you do today and anything that happens in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3077)|
| 0:51:27| Commissioner Smith, are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Commissioner Wright, I think I just saw John walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Yes, but you have other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Commissioner Gill, and then I'll call on Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| I just wanted to speak to part of the resolution with the statement that Commissioner Smith just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| which is on page four, that I needed some clarification to, of the UOP plan that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| And it indicates that be it further resolved that pursuant to section 705 of the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3117)|
| 0:52:05| the commission hereby consents to and approves the adoption, closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| and continued administration of the 2014 amended and restated UOP, effective January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3130)|
| 0:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Commissioner Wright, are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Go ahead, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Which legislative district do you live in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Have you voted yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Have you voted yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| That way I can't affect your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| I say that in levity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Counselor, would you mind stating the formula?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| John D. Valiant, Jr., 800 South Gay Street, Nashville, Tennessee, suite 1650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| And I'm sorry to put you on the spot, but I've been placed on the spot, so here is the question that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3185)|
| 0:53:13| It's in resolution form requested by the mayor saying that you helped author it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3193)|
| 0:53:21| but maybe there are some things in here that you might shed some light on for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| This is a resolution requesting the affirmative vote of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| And there are three items in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| The first one is that the Knox County Commission direct the Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3222)|
| 0:53:51| As this has occurred, as stated, and I guess I got confused a little bit by the front page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3231)|
| 0:54:01| one of the dockets that's listed is 1953-83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| That's 1-9-5-6-8-3-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| And in that, about, this is all about, these are simple questions, so there's no real tough quiz here being administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3252)|
| 0:54:26| About page 3 of that, the transcript of the testimony given that day about page 3, about page line 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3266)|
| 0:54:37| going on to the next page, line 5 or 6, there was a request to dismiss and or, and the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3277)|
| 0:54:46| disqualify the Knox County Law Director's office, and continuing on a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| or anyone who has communicated with the Knox County's law office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| Did that prohibit me from talking to the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| This occurred, this transcript was written more than a month and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| and when I read it, if I had been in contact with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| I could have been disqualified from ever coming before that court asking for any relief as relates to the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3313)|
| 0:55:22| At least that's the way I read it, and because of that, this is my second offended sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3322)|
| 0:55:31| I haven't spoken to Bud Armstrong in over a month and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| This lawsuit has upset me so sufficient that I've been unable to talk to my friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| my seatmate on commission, my counselor in my official capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| because I thought his honor was saying no one or anyone that has talked to him is going to be disqualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3351)|
| 0:56:01| or enjoined, is that the word I used a moment ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3361)|
| 0:56:09| Or in the alternative, disqualified, from talking about this suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| Well, you see, this suit has a lot of legal stuff in it that has me a little bit upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3375)|
| 0:56:24| Let me go on to just another line in that particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| I can only answer one question at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| That one's rhetorical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| What you're reading from is a transcript that I had no part in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| No, but you did write what I've got before me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| And this is all I can really speak to, and it's pretty plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| It is pretty plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| And it's really something that was brought up by Chancellor Weaver that I think he felt that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| the county commission should speak on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| So that's why this was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| That's the reason for the whole proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| But it enjoined, it kept, it is to keep people from being disqualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| you can't talk to the law director the way he was speaking right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Let me go on to another page, page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| This is about line 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| It was talking about declaratory judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| I believe that's what's being asked for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| Declaratory judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| That's what the suit was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| And then going on to page 14 about lines 13 through 20, the judge opined that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3458)|
| 0:57:51| the mayor has control of administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3471)|
| 0:58:00| and that the legal affairs are reserved to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| And that's the judge's words in this particular hearing that was taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| So if the law department has, let's see, if Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3488)|
| 0:58:18| passes resolutions and ordinances, if the mayor is responsible for carrying those out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3498)|
| 0:58:28| and the charter is what the judge was reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| the law department has all the legal affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| then how is it that this resolution in its first paragraph can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| that the Knox County Commission directs the Knox County law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| Help me with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Because I believe that the law director in this case is misinterpreting what the judge was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| I'm listening to the judge speak and read from the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| I know what the judge said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| What I'm saying is really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| The executive branch of the government like negotiates contracts with people, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| They may go to the law director and say, Mr. Law Director, is this particular phrase legal or illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3554)|
| 0:59:23| But when it comes to the end game, the executive is the one who has to sign off on the contract, not the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| All the law director there has to do is to give advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| I've represented members groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| Let me pause this for just a second and go back to the question now without getting too far afield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| You're asking in this resolution that Knox County Commission direct the law director on a legal affair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| I appreciate the answer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Let me go on to the second paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| No, we're asking the resolution specifically directs him to dismiss this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| And that's a legal attorney function, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| To dismiss is an attorney function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| Yeah, and you usually do that at the direction of your client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| Your client is who tells the attorney what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| Since I've done this for 44 years, I've never dismissed a lawsuit without my client's advice and consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| Now, maybe you have an argument who the client is, but I understand it's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| And I think the county commission and the mayor are the proper people to give direction to what Knox County is to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| So you're disagreeing with the transcript that the judge's words were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| Not necessarily, but I think it's being misinterpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| And if that's what I would discuss that with the chancellor, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| And that's what I'm glad you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| I need to write that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| We'll discuss that with the chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| I won't because I'm not involved in this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| I really appreciate you standing with me for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| The second paragraph says that Knox County Commission directs that no litigation regarding the plans may be filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3673)|
| 1:01:28| without the express written authority of Knox County Commission and the Knox County mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| The client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| Knox County Commission, again, is going to tell the law director what to do as the attorney of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| They are the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Knox County is the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| And so I think that the proper flow of things should be that the mayor and the county commission are in control of what litigation needs to be brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3709)|
| 1:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| And what this really succinctly illustrates is the fact that there are attorneys of one opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3722)|
| 1:02:11| and there are attorneys of a different opinion and we will not settle that here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3731)|
| 1:02:19| And then in the third paragraph, I don't know who's getting relief out of that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3739)|
| 1:02:29| Let me say you weren't here when Commissioner Anders spoke a moment ago, but he used the word clawback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| And this litigation is taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| Is Knox County seeking a return of funds if there is an adverse ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3762)|
| 1:02:50| The purpose of that paragraph is really to protect members of duly appointed boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3770)|
| 1:03:01| such as the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board, the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board Executive Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| from further legal action being brought against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| It's protecting people that this county has duly appointed to perform their specific functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| That's what that's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| They don't want them sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| So it has nothing to do with clawback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Is there clawback in any of this litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| From my understanding is that the law director is asking that certain deputies who have been paid pension benefits up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3811)|
| 1:03:42| be required to return those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Now, that's my understanding whether that's, and that would be a clawback of you're clawing back something that you've already given somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3825)|
| 1:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| So it's not, we're not going to seek return of funds given in pension money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Mr. Law Director, are you seeking to have funds returned to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| In the original suit, we asked the chancellor to declare whether we could pay paid leave cash out in the formula or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3849)|
| 1:04:20| The pension board continues to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| There are eight to ten people right now where they are being paid paid leave cash out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| that are subject to the definition of what the chancellor does, if I recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| Those people may be subject to overpayment depending how the chancellor rules in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3876)|
| 1:04:44| All other people, these are all insert cases right now, which is separate and apart from the declaratory judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3884)|
| 1:04:53| The declaratory judgment case is the one that the pension board has spent all this money on to avoid the chancellor from answering the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3893)|
| 1:05:04| And they are before you tonight litigating the case that will be before the chancellor to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| The question could be answered that it is proper that they pay post-severance compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| Then we need to make some revisions, which they are trying to do now, to make the plan align with what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3919)|
| 1:05:26| The answer could be no, we do not include post-severance compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| Then we would need to make some changes to align with what is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| The question that we asked was answer the question so that the board can get clarity under the legal points on what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3936)|
| 1:05:46| All this clawback stuff is an assert action, which is against individual officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| Are they entitled to, if so, how much and when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| And they're trying in this resolution to co-mingle the declaratory judgment action and the assert actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3956)|
| 1:06:04| So there's no request for us for damages, restitution, or anything in the DEC action or declaratory judgment action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3964)|
| 1:06:15| We just ask the court to answer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| And the pension board attorneys have fought for a year to keep motions going, just like they're doing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3978)|
| 1:06:26| in front of the chancellor so that he cannot answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| I would ask myself, I wonder why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| But to answer your question, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| I know that I've asked questions and sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| I'm here as long as you want me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| No, sometimes I had maybe stepped on your toes or in front of you as we moved through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| Is there anything else you'd like to say in defense of what you have written here for us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| Knox County promised these officers that they'd pay them a pension as a part of their package of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4021)|
| 1:07:13| They made a promise and now it looks like they're trying to back out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| The officers are entitled to what they were promised that they would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| Just that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| And I truly 100% agree with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| And the chancellor did want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| The chancellor was wanting to hear from, I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| I was in court one day last week, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| The chancellor wanted to hear from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| That's what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Can I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| And with my appreciation, counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| Mr. Chairman, what we have before us is paperwork that's prepared that, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4071)|
| 1:08:02| commission to tell the law director what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| Dismiss this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| I'm reminded of an action that took place way before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| Not maybe that far, but it sort of left a bad taste in everyone's mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| It was between the Board of Education and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| I believe Knox County blinked that day and went before the bench with an agreement, with an agreed to position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4107)|
| 1:08:41| That was between an elected body and an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| And his honor said, well, I see that you're both standing here asking for me to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4126)|
| 1:08:55| Whether it's right or wrong, you're asking me, both of sound mind and body, to approve this paperwork, this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4135)|
| 1:09:09| And he said, and in light of that, I pronounce you man and wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| He did not rule on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| He just said it was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| That's not the position that we find ourselves in here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| We are, we, Knox County, are currently before the bar asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4165)|
| 1:09:36| And as I see us sitting here this evening, we're non-attorney spokespeople for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4176)|
| 1:09:45| We, county commission sitting here, non-attorney spokespeople for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| can look at court and see the simple question being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| Is the pension board following the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| That's what's been laying there before his honor for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| A simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Is the pension board following the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| I don't think that the mayor can ask for it to be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| Commission obviously can't answer the question here in this open forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| The law director is asked, and I think only the court can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| So I cannot support this resolution in its format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| Commissioner Jay, your light was on, and I recognize Commissioner Gill after Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| I just wanted to take a moment to read two parts of our charter that are often discussed but overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4258)|
| 1:11:07| Section 302 of the executive branch of the Knox County Charter says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| the mayor shall be the head of the executive branch of Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| responsible for the exercising of all executive and administrative functions of the county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| and shall be the chief fiscal officer of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| Furthermore, in that same section 3.03, paragraph M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| says the mayor of Knox County has the sole power and authority to enter in contracts on behalf of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| as except as otherwise provided in this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| We have a resolution before us that is asking us to direct the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| not require the law department not to enter a law that says you must do X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| That will be up to the law department, the law director, and ultimately the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| to determine what to do from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| What we have before us is a resolution which has been prepared properly, I'm understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4319)|
| 1:12:08| and says that we are being asked to direct our law department to settle this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4328)|
| 1:12:16| to find a resolution, and to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| We have been asked time and again by this judge, this chancellor, to make our opinions known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4339)|
| 1:12:28| We are the representatives of Knox County, and the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| This body represents over 450,000 people, and it is our job to take the will of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4354)|
| 1:12:42| cast a vote, and do the business of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| We are the representatives of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| Now, we will not decide this case in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| We will not bring it to resolution tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| But if we believe that our mayor is the chief executive officer of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| and we believe that we are the duly appointed and elected representatives of the people of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| then we have an opportunity to say what we want on behalf of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| And I believe that the majority of the people of Knox County do not want to continue to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| countless of hundreds of thousands of dollars having lawyers fight lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| arguing lawyers against lawyers, and continue this, what I would gladly put my name against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| like the mayor did, saying, this is madness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| Ultimately, the judge will decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| But we are asked tonight to put our opinion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| It's not going to finish things, but it is going to allow us as a body to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| where do we want our time, our energy, and our resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| I'll remind everybody that this body was not asked for any opinion on should this lawsuit be drawn in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4426)|
| 1:13:57| This body and the executive, the chief financial officer of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| who are responsible to the taxpayers for how to spend their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| were not asked in any way, shape, and form, were not consulted in any way, shape, and form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| and were not brought to have any opinion in any shape and form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| whether or not to continue to spend taxpayer money doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| If we had had buy-in and we had approved it, or we had had some opinion in it on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| then that would be a different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| But this was unilaterally done, and now your chief financial officer, your chief executive officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| and now the appointed and elected people of Knox County, represented by us, are saying, stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4472)|
| 1:14:39| Finish this. Do right by our people. Do right by our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| Support our team, support our officers, and find a resolution so we can all get back to the county's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| I think we owe it to both the people of Knox County and to the judge to have an opinion today, and I call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4491)|
| 1:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| Commissioner Jay has called the question, called for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| We do have one light on. I'm going to let Commissioner Gill make her statement, and then we will get to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| And I think it is an appropriate statement to make to respond to Chancellor Weaver, but above all, respond to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4521)|
| 1:15:29| I think the pillars of good governance is to build and strengthen the relationship with ultimately all our stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4529)|
| 1:15:36| in the community, and really that is the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| It is essential to build public trust, democratic participation, fairness, and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| We work hard every day to serve the needs of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| We are here to serve the needs of Knox County, and let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4551)|
| 1:16:03| Can we have a roll call vote, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Yes, we are going to have a roll call vote, but I also, the last two months you've seen, I always want everybody to be exactly clear on exactly what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| So this is the resolution that was given us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, directing the Knox County Law Director and his designees to dismiss with prejudice all litigation regarding the Uniformed Officers Pension Plan, Resolution R-18-10-101-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| So is that clear for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4583)|
| 1:16:45| So I'm going to ask the clerk's office, do you recall who was on tap for the first vote in the roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4605)|
| 1:16:53| Go ahead, go ahead and call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| Commissioner Carringer, I'm very, very honored to cast my vote to pass this resolution for the men and women that serve us every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181026?start=4620)|
