| 0:00:00| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| It's time for the Beer Board to have its January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=3)|
| 0:00:08| We have five applications tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=8)|
| 0:00:11| There are no hearings, but I do have some announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=11)|
| 0:00:14| Three establishments, San Juan Los Lagos Restaurant and Grill on Cherry Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=14)|
| 0:00:20| El Chico Restaurant on Cedar Lane, and Discount Puff Sanal on Millartown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=20)|
| 0:00:25| are scheduled to go before a hearing officer on February the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=25)|
| 0:00:29| A pre-conference suspension revocation hearing was held this morning for Danish Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| doing business as Quick Stop on merchants, and there will be a hearing on March 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| This is a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| Sometimes between the pre-conference and the actual hearing, an agreement is reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| and so there isn't a full hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| So I shall keep you posted on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=49)|
| 0:00:55| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| I was just wondering, is that for underage serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| That's the reason for the hearings that are coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| And this is not the first rodeo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Second offense or higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| The first time they submit a report to the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| and then the second time they come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| and then the third time they go before the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| Bad things can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| Expensive things can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| It can be suspension or it can be revocation, depending on the outcome or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| And then the third thing is you'll remember that we had this TABC annual report that was due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| because of some kind of experimental work between TABC, the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| and we have filed ours early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| Once we got the form that was supposed to be used, it was quickly done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| Now, Ms. Mitchell, that I've done all that, could you call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=115)|

| 0:02:04| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=126)|

| 0:02:12| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Do I have a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| The first one is Blackstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| It's at the old Valerian location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Is there a representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| If you would come forward, state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| It's Daniel Leal at 940 Blackstock, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Sergeant Hunter, how about the records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| No applicable record for Mr. Leal, but the managers, Mr. Matheny and Mr. Bales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| have not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| They are scheduled this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| This coming Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| There's the snow, and I guess I don't know if they had an appointment this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| Well, they have quite some time to do this from the time you file your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| What about the file, Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| We still need a copy of the sales tax registration, approval from the building inspector, fire prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| health department, and those missing owner-manager apps we did receive today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| and they're in your additional information we gave you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Before we proceed with this, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| You have at your online site a concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| You're selling tickets for a concert on January the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| I'm not really sure we're selling tickets for anything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| Well, I went to your website, and I saw that there was an event scheduled for January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| There's not a website up for Blackstock yet, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Well, somebody's stolen your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Blackstocklive.com is the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| That was not where I went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Chairman Ballmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| I guess more of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| Based on what I've seen this past year of beer board applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| I'm going to vote no on this tonight because there are too many things that are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| I think that we pass over too many of these people, and too many of them are coming back and selling underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| And it's a responsibility to have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| It's a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| It's a show and a sign of giving good responsibility when you can get your permit in on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| and get the application done on time before it's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| And it is my opinion that when you have way too many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| now I can understand a surrender of a former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| To me, that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| But for two of the managers not even to be in for their background or for their training yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| in my opinion, they can wait a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| You know, I'd like to see these applicants come and have these things done and in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| and in a way we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| and they've shown to me that they're responsible enough to have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| So on this case, you know, that's why I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| We have an alternate to voting against it tonight, and that is we can postpone it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| and they can't do any business during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| That would give all the inspections time to be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| and it would also give the two managers an opportunity to get in and get the ---| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| make sure they have the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| So an alternative to just turning it down is to postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| So would you consider that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| And then I'll make a motion that we postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Mr. Stair, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| I certainly understand your sentiments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| and it is sort of frustrating when a lot of things aren't done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| but I think we have to be really careful because I think we need to treat every applicant the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| So if we're going to stop approving that are missing, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| we need to have some kind of line if they're missing two things or three or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| because then it starts to look arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| And maybe our attorney can speak to this, but, I mean, I've been on this a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| and we've always approved it, pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| even if they're missing quite a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| So this is a dramatic change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Well, I mean, I would not vote to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| I would vote to approve it pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| Let me just insert that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| I've been on the Beer Board going into the fourth year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| and we've had two different sets of two different policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| The first period of time I was on the Beer Board, we did not approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| If you did not have the task class completed and the records checked, then there was no approval pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| We did not automatically postpone it to give you the 30 days to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Somewhere along the way we took a different path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| And so we have had a tendency, and I think that was because we had some cases come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| where people were ill and were not able to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| Whether that's a reasonable excuse or not, that seemed to be the will of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| I will certainly entertain other thoughts on the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And, Councilman DeLavoe, if you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Yes, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| I was going to say that I had that same recollection that, and especially Councilwoman Roddy was very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| very vigilant on that because of the importance of the underage serving issue as a threat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=461)|
| 0:07:50| that we tried at least insofar as it had to do with the task training that that all be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| before they got their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| On some of the inspections, some of them have to do with the department being able to get out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| and look at the wiring or some safety feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| To me, that's different in kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| I think you can't get your permit until it's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| and the applicant has no control over when they can get an inspector out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| So if we're going to make a distinction, I don't know whether we are or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| I think we should segregate those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| One, you've got to have all your people trained that are going to be in charge of running the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| because that's where the bad things happen vis-à-vis the public with minors being served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| versus the physical inspections that take two things to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| The owner's got to get his work done, and then the department's got to get out there in their schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| I wonder if I could ask that gentleman, will you still be able to open on time if we postpone this a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| Because we're caught in the middle of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| We're actually kind of planning on opening, like, the first week of March is actually what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| So if we put you off a month, we will not prevent you from doing something you would want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| I do have a task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| I've taken it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| One of you has taken it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| They need their fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| That's what they're waiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Their fingerprints taken, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| The expectation is that everybody who's listed as an owner or a manager has to meet those qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| And if they haven't met part of them, it's the will, apparently, of this board that they have them all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| I'm going to go to Councilman Grieve, then to Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| I was just going to say, Brenda, that you're correct in terms of the three years when we were prior to the new council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=574)|
| 0:09:43| coming on, that one of the things that we did look at is what the responsibilities of the individual were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| and whether or not they had taken care of those responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| And I'm talking about what Councilman DellaVope is talking about, that, to me, if the individual hasn't gone forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| and done what he's supposed to do because that's up to him, then that tells me something about the possibility of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| application, whereas when it is up to the, you know, under construction and building and permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| and things like that, I can see where that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| But when the individual has not done what they should do by the time they get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| I'm inclined not to approve until that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| And postponement is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I think there are cases where maybe the work's been done and they just haven't gotten out and inspected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| And that's probably true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| And we could ask the applicants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| But sometimes the work's just not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I mean, that's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| And when I just have had a problem sitting here all year approving these things, blindly leaving it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| I think what tipped me off was when the last Sergeant Hunter's report came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| and there was at least one on there that was in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| I mean, it's like, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| I mean, we've got to have responsibility and this is a way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| You fill out the application and get it done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| But there are cases where, yeah, yeah, we just haven't gotten it inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| Well, I haven't heard, you know, a clear policy change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| I mean, like this application, it says task class complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| So this person has taken the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| You know, it's my understanding, too, they just have to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| If they wanted to, each application could just have one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| And so basically the incentive there is just to have one person and one person do the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| You know, to me, beer board, I mean, they have to do this is a big bureaucratic step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| They've got to check off all these boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| I'm for making, you know, I'm in favor of making it easy to do business in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| And if we can help these businesses get their beer permit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| in a more efficient and effective way, I think we should help them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| I mean, there's a lot of boxes to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Starting a new business, there's different challenges of getting the building ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| and doing different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| And I have perfect confidence in our staff that they're not going to issue a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| until all the things are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| So I don't, I mean, I'm not in favor of a change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Mr. Frost, I mean, I'd like to, you know, we've had this discussion before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| but these, you know, the problem I've got is these boxes aren't weighted unless we say they're weighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| And then when we say that, then you're in shark-infested waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| I mean, am I right about this or wrong about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| Well, no, I understand what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| and was actually thinking the same sort of comments that Councilman Grieve said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| about things that are within the permit holder's power to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| versus things where you're waiting on, you know, your sales tax registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| and some other things where, you know, you all might consider a policy where you do wait the different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=783)|
| 0:13:14| to see if there's enough where you want to give the applicant additional time to get things postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| excuse me, to get things completed through a 30-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| or if there are, you know, minor things, return of the former owner's beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| where that shouldn't necessarily hold up somebody and you all move to approve subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| But that's, you know, the policy of the beer board needs to be consistent throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=818)|
| 0:13:47| So, you know, someone watching a beer board meeting today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| and someone watching a beer board meeting with a similar but different applicant three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| or four months on down the road, they have fairly similar and not disparate treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| You know, I'm going to vote to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| I mean, I don't think that we start with this gentleman's established tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| and make an example out of his establishment, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| I hear what Councilman Wallace is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| You know, I tend to perhaps agree with what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| But, you know, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| I think that we need to be careful as if you had a, I mean, I don't know where this gentleman lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| you know, if he's from Knoxville or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Well, I guess he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| But you may have management coming in if you have a big chain or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| and, you know, they may not move here right to the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| And that's what the problem I have in agreeing with Councilman Starr is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| do we want to stop that and do we want to stop it for a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| What if it's, you know, if it's August and, you know, you've got football coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| and then they're going to miss a substantial amount of revenue on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| It's a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| You know, I think the question here that we're going to have to deal with is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| are we going to deny based on things that they have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| and then not things that the city, you know, if the city hasn't done theirs, then it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| You know, again, those boxes aren't weighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| So it's just a tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| It's really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| I think we're on a slippery slope here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Excuse us while we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| I'm kind of picking on you, but I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| I have a couple of things to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| I'm in the process of looking at some revisions to the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| We have the 13 items that are determined that have to be present from the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| the Nashville connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| but we also have some other issues that have come about in regard to underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| And so I have been talking to Rob and to Allison about some revisions to the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| some of the wording, some of the language, to make it a little bit more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| And part of that could include, if that's the will of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| that we expect you to have these things done that are within your control before you come to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| Now, Vice Mayor Pavlis has pointed out that sometimes we have out-of-town chains come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| and they don't bring those managers here until last minute because they don't want them on payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| but they want to start generating revenue the day they arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| So there are going to be some exceptions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Again, the past policy for a couple of years was that if people had not completed the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| or the records check because it seems that those folks are more likely to sell underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| then it was postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| We then moved to a plan where we granted it pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| Now, I know that Ms. Day is not going to let an application out of her hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| until every I is dotted, T crossed several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| So from that standpoint, I felt fairly confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| But I also have the same thoughts that Councilman Wallace does, that are we sending a message to folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1047)|
| 0:17:35| Lots of times when people come before this board over the three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| I have pretty well learned to gauge how soon we would see some of them back for underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| And so far, I've been almost 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| And that's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| But my point is that we do really need to communicate that these other things are out of your control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| They're just out of your control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| But the task class and the records check for most of the cases are within your control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1080)|

| 0:23:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Again, we like it when people come with everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Tell us when you're going to be open for business or are you open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| We're already open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| And is the food good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| That was a trick question, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| People say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| What's the best thing on the menu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| Tandoori chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| And tandoori naan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| And what are your hours of operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| We open 11 to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1409)|

| 0:23:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| The next one is the Junkyard, and this is in Councilman Brown's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Mark Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Junkyard is 115 South Central, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| When this work is all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Do you want to tell us about the Junkyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| It's kind of a different name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| We're trying to stick with the theme of it used to be Big Don's Elegant Junk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Kind of stick with the theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| It's going to be a country western restaurant and bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Did you keep any of Big Don's Junk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| We have a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| A lot of the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| About Chili's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Any special food that we need to know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Probably more bar food type things, but it will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Jimmy, Mart, and Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1480)|
| 0:24:49| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Kevin Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| My address is 2634 East Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| And this is also in Councilman Brown's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| I need to go ahead of myself there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| What about the records, Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I'm going to say we're still awaiting the building inspection approval, fire prevention, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Now oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Councilman Delavaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| I'm looking here and I don't know whether mine's marked up different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| but it says task program completed and it says no on mine, but I don't know if that's correct or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| It has been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| It's been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Other applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| I'm just curious about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| It's KJ's Mini Mart and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| What's the more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Just fitted hats and T-shirts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| And there's no manager listed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Are you going to be there all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Up until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Probably until about three months or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| And you know that when you add managers, you need to come back and see our friend Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Does anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| But I guess before we adjourn, I know that there is some concern among different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| with different thoughts about what we approve and what we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| If you could send your input to Mr. Frost about anything you would like to see changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| or specified or weighted or chained or whatever you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| If you'll let Mr. Frost know, we'll see if we can work some of that into some changes in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| I had indicated to you that I will be coming forth with a new ordinance requirement concerning these applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| It's a work in progress is all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Several of you all spoke and you said, well, it's been our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| I don't know that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Do we have a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| We have a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| We have a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| I chose the wrong word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Well, several people said policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| We don't have a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| We have a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| And I think that so at any time we can change our practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| And every two years when we reorganize, we can change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Councilman Dellavope and then Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I was just going to say, could someone take a look at whatever cover letter or instruction sheet we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| and make sure it's in plain English so that it says in bold letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| that you have done the task force kind of training, for example, that you will have difficulty before our body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| I mean, something that really puts them unnoticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| You must have this complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| There are two letters that are also works in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| One is a cover letter to go with the application just to spell out some things, make them a little clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| And the second one is for nonprofits who seem to have a tendency to overlook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| Special event things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Who have a special event and they forget about the beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| and then they want a special meeting of the beer board to deal with something they forgot to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| So we will be sending out all of the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| Mr. Frost has been working on the December meeting, which is scheduled for Christmas Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| And knowing how this board operates, I'm not seeing that we'll have anybody here on Christmas Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| So we're looking at a different date for the meeting of both the beer board and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| I was just suggesting that as wonderful as our lawyers are in doing things, sometimes they use big words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| They're confused instead of clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| So maybe we could have, like, short sentences and plain speech and all those good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| And no offense to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Issue obfuscation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1725)|

| 0:28:52| If you can't get that, you don't deserve the permit anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| That could be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Now, councilmen stare that you've heard all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Mr. Wallace, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| It is a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| And I misspoke when I said policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| But I guess my point is, and I think if we want to change it, we should change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| But I don't think we should sort of have the debate every application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| And we should have some discussion either at a time like this when we've got 30 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| to discuss how we want this board to run or at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| But I just think, you know, if they're --if we know that if they haven't gotten their background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| and we're not going to approve them, then, you know, they shouldn't even really be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| If we know if it's our practice and policy not to approve beer permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| if they haven't gotten the background check, then they should know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| and shouldn't even really be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| I mean, I don't see the point of having to come down here and postpone it, you know, and drag it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| That's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Well, the ordinance says that they have to appear, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| So they would have to appear just to have it postponed the way the ordinance currently reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1802)|
| 0:30:11| We've been down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| So we may need to change that wording, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| Last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| I think it ought to be the expectation that they come here that they've gotten their work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| And if they haven't, then okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| But these people got their work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| And one of them was turned in, like, you know, January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| I mean, it's not they can do it if they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| I'm not trying to be difficult, but beer permits are a serious deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| And when they end up in Sergeant Hunter's hands over there, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| that's really disturbing to me that we've given these people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| and they've shown a lack of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| The wording of the ordinance is that holding a beer permit from the city of Knoxville is a privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| And so I would suggest that Councilman Wallace is thinking that it's an earned privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| and it carries responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| I don't think we've heard the last of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| And so I'll be working with Ms. Mitchell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| and we'll be trying to figure out a way to extend the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Again, when someone comes before us, it's really kind of a tough time to change the practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| We need to have the practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| If we're going to change it, then we need to make sure that everybody knows up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| and that would perhaps coincide with the letter that's going to go with the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| Sounds like we're on a good path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| If there's no other business, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130122?start=1898)|
