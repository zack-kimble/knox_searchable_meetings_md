| 2:58:07| they're not going to show up at a job, they're not going to be able to pay attention in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10687)|
| 2:58:11| We have to heal individuals, we have to help individuals in the home, we have to help these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10691)|
| 2:58:17| children and families get their self-confidence, feel valued, because for so many years Blacks were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10697)|
| 2:58:25| dehumanized. And now it's at the point to where we're passing that information on generationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10705)|
| 2:58:32| And with that being said, when we see people doing other things for others and not for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10712)|
| 2:58:38| that is stamping that seal to say that others really don't value us. And what made me really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10718)|
| 2:58:44| even want to bring that point up is while we've been out here working, there have been some Black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10724)|
| 2:58:49| groups that were afraid to ask for the money because they feel like the city is not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10729)|
| 2:58:53| do anything for us anyway. There's other groups, there have been white people that want to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10733)|
| 2:58:58| but they're afraid to speak up, they say that they will help privately. Why is it a fear for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| people to speak up and ask as if it's going to be a retaliation against people? People shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10743)|
| 2:59:09| feel that way. The city is here. If we can work together, Mayor, we want to try to make your city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10749)|
| 2:59:16| flourish and become better under your toolage, but we need your assistance, we need these funds so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10756)|
| 2:59:22| we can start making changes. These people need to be introduced to naturopath doctors, nutritionists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10762)|
| 2:59:29| Ms. Brown, that concludes your five minutes. Thank you. Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10769)|
| 2:59:36| Councilmembers, that's all. That's everyone who's signed up to speak to this. Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10776)|
| 2:59:46| The point that I wanted to raise is that in addition to all the programs that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10786)|
| 2:59:54| discussed thus far, we also began a discussion last year that we have yet to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10794)|
| 3:00:03| And it was about what are we going to do in terms of re-envisioning policing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10803)|
| 3:00:12| We had a series of workshops, and then we had a solution prescribed by the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10812)|
| 3:00:19| presented to us. From the community, we have had months and months of work developing a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10819)|
| 3:00:28| putting, you know, to lift up this idea that we, like other cities, can bring in alternatives to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10828)|
| 3:00:37| policing that provide a more safe first responder model for some of the more vulnerable members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10837)|
| 3:00:48| our community, those with mental health challenges, those that are part of our homeless community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10848)|
| 3:00:57| We have not followed through on those conversations, and I see that as a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10857)|
| 3:01:05| this effort as well. I know that the Knoxville Heart Coalition has been a part of this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| and I support the work that they're doing, and I believe that we need to have a discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10871)|
| 3:01:17| bringing a model like the one that they're proposing into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10877)|
| 3:01:23| When we discussed the co-responder model just during a workshop last year, we were introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10883)|
| 3:01:31| to it, and all of a sudden it was a thing. It should be coming back before us, but it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10891)|
| 3:01:39| like before we're able to even review that new initiative, there's money going into the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10899)|
| 3:01:47| $400,000, to expand it. I don't know if that's what the mayor's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10907)|
| 3:01:53| you know, put in her final budget, but that's the proposed amount to put it into the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10913)|
| 3:01:57| without us having a discussion about if that's what works for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| or whether we would rather move forward with this other model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10921)|
| 3:02:07| In addition to the gun violence we're seeing in our communities, we have to remain committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10927)|
| 3:02:14| to this discussion, or last year, the workshops that we spent many, many hours in was just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10934)|
| 3:02:22| disingenuous process, and here we are as a city having just experienced a horrifying, heart-wrenching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10942)|
| 3:02:33| officer-involved shooting in our community, and we are acting as if we have no role to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10953)|
| 3:02:40| in the current violence that's happening around the community. I'm very confused by that. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10960)|
| 3:02:46| a very direct role to play in keeping our communities and our students safe. Many parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10966)|
| 3:02:54| of our budget touch them, and it's important that we commit actual dollars that can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10974)|
| 3:03:03| towards violence intervention, as our guest, our public speaker said, not towards the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10983)|
| 3:03:10| process, but much, much early on, even when we're thinking about our first responders that we send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10990)|
| 3:03:16| out into the community. So, I really, I encourage us to put the four million back in. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10996)|
| 3:03:25| I will go ahead and make the motion and see if there's support for amending the resolution before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11005)|
| 3:03:36| us to include a $4 million commitment request of the administration towards this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11016)|
| 3:03:48| I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| Council Member Parker, I'm afraid that you have to vote first on a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11030)|
| 3:03:56| You can't do a substitute for a substitute. So, Council has to vote on the original substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11036)|
| 3:04:02| and then if it fails, there can be a second substitute, but you have to vote on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11042)|
| 3:04:07| you can't do a substitute for a substitute. So, if you all wish to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11047)|
| 3:04:16| Unless we remove the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| do we want to withdraw the original motion and make another substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11060)|
| 3:04:26| I'm not sure. Council Member Singh, I mean, you could vote on your substitute motion or see how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11066)|
| 3:04:34| I would not mind at all putting it out there to see if there is support for the four million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| but then I would like to, if there is not, I would like to resubmit this. So, what is the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11078)|
| 3:04:46| Mr. Swanson, could you help out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11089)|
| 3:04:50| I'll do my best. I think the appropriate motion is to withdraw both the motion and the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11090)|
| 3:04:57| for the substitute motion. Then we need to do what was originally should have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11097)|
| 3:05:04| which was have a motion on the resolution that was on the agenda, okay? And a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11104)|
| 3:05:13| And then you can have a, well, that will be the actual substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11113)|
| 3:05:18| as I hear it now. So, just go back to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11118)|
| 3:05:22| and then if that doesn't pass, then you can offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| Well, it's not the original resolution because, you know, some of the other language was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| I don't want to speak for you, Council Member Singh, but I was trying to just put the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11134)|
| 3:05:40| million back into this update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11140)|
| 3:05:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11143)|
| 3:05:43| Well, if you just want to put the four million into it, then you move for approval of the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11143)|
| 3:05:51| resolution as it appeared on the agenda, you second that, and then you offer a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11151)|
| 3:05:57| which is this motion plus adding the four million dollars to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11157)|
| 3:06:01| Okay, do you want to break it down to, you know, I'm not sure what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11161)|
| 3:06:10| Yeah, first thing to do is withdraw the substitute motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11170)|
| 3:06:17| I withdraw the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| And who seconded the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11180)|
| 3:06:25| Who seconded it, Tommy Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11187)|
| 3:06:28| Do you wish to withdraw your second, Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11188)|
| 3:06:32| On the original item that's in the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11192)|
| 3:06:38| I think no, it's on the substitute that we saw one page of, you know, that was shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11198)|
| 3:06:45| I do not wish to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11205)|
| 3:06:47| Okay, so he's not withdrawing his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11207)|
| 3:06:50| So then you have to vote on it before we can move to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11210)|
| 3:06:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11214)|
| 3:06:56| This motion on the floor at the moment is the motion that has a language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11216)|
| 3:07:05| Council Member Singh discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11225)|
| 3:07:06| It does not contain four million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| It does talk about, you know, commitments to violence and eruption beyond just what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11228)|
| 3:07:15| already done with one million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11235)|
| 3:07:18| Council Member Singh, I don't want to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| That's if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| I'm just trying to keep up with what procedure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11242)|
| 3:07:25| Okay, so is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| The motion on the floor is the thing that Council Member Singh emailed to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11247)|
| 3:07:33| a few hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| I don't know what time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| It's similar to what was on the agenda, but without the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11257)|
| 3:07:42| Okay, there's been a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11262)|
| 3:07:43| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| Any further discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11264)|

| 3:12:02| I would like to understand what this is about, especially the fiber aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11522)|
| 3:12:09| And does that go with broadband at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| Or just an explanation of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11531)|

| 3:12:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11541)|
| 3:12:22| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering, City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11542)|
| 3:12:28| For some time now, there's a history in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| There is, we have had approved what they call ATMS funding, which is Advanced Traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11551)|
| 3:12:37| Management Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| It's very similar to the TDOT SmartWay program that they have for our interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11559)|
| 3:12:46| We're bringing that to our local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| One of the difficult parts of this project, and to some degree why it's taken so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11569)|
| 3:12:56| is finding space on poles that allow us to put our fiber in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11576)|
| 3:13:02| There's a communication space, as a lot of folks, particularly on KUB poles, AT&T and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11582)|
| 3:13:09| other providers, as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| We have worked out an arrangement with KUB where they are allowing us in what I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11592)|
| 3:13:18| call their protected communication space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| And we will be stringing cable for the ATMS project in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11601)|
| 3:13:28| What we've agreed to, and it makes a lot of sense, it is a win-win for everyone involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11608)|
| 3:13:33| is that in the event KUB continues to want to provide a Wi-Fi service, and therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11613)|
| 3:13:41| fiber would be required of them to string, then they will merely strap their fiber cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11621)|
| 3:13:48| It's a completely separate cable, and we must keep the accounting separate because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11628)|
| 3:13:52| of the grant funds that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11632)|
| 3:13:56| They would have the option to strap their cable, if you will, to our cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11636)|
| 3:14:03| And that was what allowed us to go to their communication space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11643)|
| 3:14:06| A lot less preparatory costs associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11646)|
| 3:14:10| Coupled with KUB will also be maintaining our cable, our fiber, in addition to should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11650)|
| 3:14:17| they put fiber up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11657)|
| 3:14:20| I hope I'm explaining that very well, but it's going to give connectivity between our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11660)|
| 3:14:24| signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| It will give us basically a home base to where we can monitor all the signals and be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11666)|
| 3:14:32| to do adjustments at our Morris Avenue facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11672)|
| 3:14:36| This is really taking our ability to manage traffic to a whole new level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| I don't know if I gave you a lot of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| I hope I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11684)|
| 3:14:47| You did, and it sounds like there is a bit of maybe an infrastructure to assist in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11687)|
| 3:14:53| future with more fiber with KUB work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11693)|
| 3:14:59| It gives them that option because we have to have what they call a carrier cable, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11699)|
| 3:15:04| is what our fiber will be strung to, and there's no additional load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| They should choose to add fiber to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| There's no additional load to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=11710)|

| 3:21:10| they used to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12070)|
| 3:21:12| So with this lease agreement in place, how much is Emerald Youth using the pool first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12072)|
| 3:21:20| and how much, how do members of the community have access to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12080)|
| 3:21:28| Parks and Rec Director Cheryl Ely is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12088)|
| 3:21:31| Ms. Ely, could you address Councilmember Parker's question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12091)|
| 3:21:36| Sorry, I'm trying to put my camera up and it's going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12096)|
| 3:21:41| Okay, well, even if we just have audio, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12101)|
| 3:21:45| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12105)|
| 3:21:46| Cheryl Ely, Director of Parks and Recreation for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12106)|
| 3:21:49| Thank you, Councilmember Parker, for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12109)|
| 3:21:52| From my understanding, and we also have someone from Emerald on the call, they are providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12112)|
| 3:21:57| for their afterschool program and some swim lessons for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12117)|
| 3:22:02| They're also opening up to allow the community to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| They're using it for parties as well as some swim lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12125)|
| 3:22:08| So it is a kind of, they're looking at different days and activities along a week, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12128)|
| 3:22:15| are, they have looked at how they can provide more opportunities for the community as they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12135)|
| 3:22:20| going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12140)|
| 3:22:22| Sanford Smith, I think, I'm sorry, Sanford Miller is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12142)|
| 3:22:25| He may can provide a little more input on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| Mr. Miller, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12152)|
| 3:22:33| Yeah, does that answer your question, Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12153)|
| 3:22:36| No, I said I would appreciate that additional input if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12156)|
| 3:22:39| Is Mr. Miller on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| Oh, there, I see your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| Okay, Mr. Miller, could you speak to Councilmember Parker's question a little further, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12163)|
| 3:22:49| Yes, thank you for your question and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12169)|
| 3:22:53| We've looked at our swim program over the past year and a half to really see how can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12173)|
| 3:22:58| we get the community more involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12178)|
| 3:22:59| I, too, was someone that grew up in that pool, so it was very personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| And currently, right now, I'm receiving maybe three to four requests from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12183)|
| 3:23:08| of wanting to use, I mean, from the community wanting to use the pool for swim lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12188)|
| 3:23:15| Again, it's open for anyone who wants to use it for birthday parties or community party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12195)|
| 3:23:21| We do have it for our after-school program for about 305 kids actually learning how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12201)|
| 3:23:27| swim every year right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| So it's very open to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| We just wish that more people in the community would take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12211)|
| 3:23:34| You can go by on Friday nights and see high schoolers from the Austinese already using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12214)|
| 3:23:38| the pool already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12218)|
| 3:23:39| So it's, again, very open for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| We just want more people to realize that and, you know, not be afraid to swim and not worry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12222)|
| 3:23:46| about getting hurt or messed up or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12226)|
| 3:23:49| So they're breaking down barriers to the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| And if the community wants to use the pool, do they contact Emerald Youth, or are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| able to go through our Parks and Rec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| It's directly through Emerald Youth, so you can go to our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12239)|
| 3:24:02| And again, I get all the emails, so it's directly through emeraldyouth.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12242)|
| 3:24:08| Do we have anything on our website that lets the public know to contact, you know, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12248)|
| 3:24:14| shares the contact information for Emerald Youth in order to book this swimming pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12254)|
| 3:24:22| We do not, but that's something that we can add to our program to kind of help foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12262)|
| 3:24:28| the conversation and community engagement around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12268)|
| 3:24:31| But we can add that to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| You know, oftentimes, especially if it's a faith-based group, the community may not feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12276)|
| 3:24:42| comfortable approaching that group to access the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12282)|
| 3:24:48| They would feel more comfortable if it were a public institution, even though their tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12288)|
| 3:24:53| dollars do go towards this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| So I think the improvements that have been discussed are needed, and I encourage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12296)|
| 3:25:02| to move forward to increase community access to the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12302)|
| 3:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12307)|
| 3:25:08| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12308)|
| 3:25:09| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12309)|
| 3:25:10| Yeah, and let me say that I am very familiar with the pool there at E.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12310)|
| 3:25:15| Davidson, because that pool, in my experience there, is why I'm afraid of water now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12315)|
| 3:25:21| can't swim, because it was back in the days when they just pushed you in water, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12321)|
| 3:25:26| was still traumatized and never learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12326)|
| 3:25:28| I've always been afraid to learn to swim after that, but just fond memories of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12328)|
| 3:25:34| of those experiences growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12334)|
| 3:25:36| And I will say that it is accessible to the community, and I actually have a grandson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12336)|
| 3:25:41| that's participating in swimming lessons there and other people, but I will agree with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12341)|
| 3:25:46| Miller that there is an opportunity for more people to take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12346)|
| 3:25:49| That's one of the things that I hear from the parents that are there is, you know, why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12349)|
| 3:25:53| people just aren't bringing their kids, and a lot of it is, and her daughter is experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12353)|
| 3:25:58| it, too, that a lot of kids, they don't want to get their hair wet, and even though there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12358)|
| 3:26:02| caps and stuff, but I have seen some slips on the counter that talk about the swimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12362)|
| 3:26:09| lessons that are there, and I appreciate the fact that they do have them there in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12369)|
| 3:26:14| but I think that, you know, there might be an opportunity for ML Youth as well as Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12374)|
| 3:26:19| and Rec to maybe just have some type of sign-up event or just a little bit more, better communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12379)|
| 3:26:26| around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12386)|
| 3:26:27| But, unfortunately, our kids are just not necessarily taking advantage, I think, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12387)|
| 3:26:33| a lot of it could be COVID, why it's slowed down a lot, because I know that they weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12393)|
| 3:26:37| available for a while due to COVID, and I had some concerns, even myself, with him starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12397)|
| 3:26:42| back swimming lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12402)|
| 3:26:43| I'm a grandson, but it's a nice facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12403)|
| 3:26:47| It is a staple in the community, and I just want to continue to see it be utilized and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12407)|
| 3:26:52| maybe see what we can do collectively to help continue to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12416)|
| 3:26:58| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12418)|
| 3:26:58| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12420)|
| 3:27:02| Deputy Mayor Brace, could you or Ms. Ely, one, talk about why we ever even entered into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12422)|
| 3:27:09| a lease agreement in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| I mean, was it closed, or why did we enter into an agreement with somebody to run it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12431)|
| 3:27:18| for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| Mr. Brace or Ms. Ely, one of you could share that history with us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12440)|
| 3:27:25| Yeah, and Ms. Ely jumped in, and I know, Vice Mayor McKenzie, you may have this history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12445)|
| 3:27:29| The facility got to the point where it needed a significant amount of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12449)|
| 3:27:33| At that time, there was actually a collaboration to help get the canceler wide, and there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12453)|
| 3:27:37| an idea that perhaps that pool would fill the void in that part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12457)|
| 3:27:44| When the canceler opened, there was still a need for the pool, but there was some capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12464)|
| 3:27:47| dollars associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| So, Emerald had stepped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12469)|
| 3:27:50| I think Emerald has put, and again, Mr. Miller jumped in, about $100,000 in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12470)|
| 3:27:55| They pay the maintenance and operation of that pool site, and again, the accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12475)|
| 3:28:00| I hope, is not only available to the public, but we can increase it over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12480)|
| 3:28:06| It's also important to note that the city still has a number of the pools we run through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12486)|
| 3:28:10| our aquatics program, two outdoor pools, two other indoor pools, one other indoor pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12490)|
| 3:28:16| in East Knoxville, the Adaptive Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12496)|
| 3:28:19| So, that was the original history on that, and Vice Mayor McKenzie, you may have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12499)|
| 3:28:23| more details beyond what I've provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12503)|
| 3:28:26| So, what I will share is that in conversations over the years, over the years, is that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| was, that there, and this was before you, Cheryl, that there were challenges actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| even being able to hire lifeguards, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12516)|
| 3:28:40| So, I don't know if that was a huge factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12520)|
| 3:28:42| I wasn't, you know, really following it that much back then, because as I said, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12522)|
| 3:28:45| many, many years ago, but I know that that was always a challenge as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12525)|
| 3:28:49| Well, I will just say, hiring lifeguards is a challenge, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12529)|
| 3:28:56| If you, we run into that ourselves at summer camp with Girl Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12536)|
| 3:29:00| So, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12540)|
| 3:29:01| I just was curious, since I'm new to council, why we had ever, ever even entered into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12541)|
| 3:29:06| lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12546)|
| 3:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12546)|
| 3:29:09| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| Council Member Ragner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12551)|

| 3:29:42| Go ahead, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12582)|
| 3:29:43| So, Mr. Miller, you guys run an after school program there at the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12583)|
| 3:29:49| Yes, ma'am, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12589)|
| 3:29:50| We have an after school ministry through several sites in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12590)|
| 3:29:53| And through those sites, each one of our programs have the opportunity to come and do a learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12593)|
| 3:29:59| to swim, where they will participate two times a week, do a eight-week program on learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12599)|
| 3:30:06| how to swim and go through three different levels of swimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12606)|
| 3:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12608)|
| 3:30:09| Do you know how many children are served and what age range are served at that facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12609)|
| 3:30:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12614)|
| 3:30:15| Over a year's time, 305 kids last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12615)|
| 3:30:19| And what was the other question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| What age range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12625)|
| 3:30:26| So, it goes from kindergarten all the way up to high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12626)|
| 3:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12629)|
| 3:30:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12630)|
| 3:30:31| And just weekdays or weekends as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12631)|
| 3:30:34| Weekdays before I learn to swim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12634)|
| 3:30:37| Weekdays before I learn to swim and weekends are open up for private swimming lessons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12637)|
| 3:30:44| as well as community swim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| So, we normally have community swim open every Saturday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12649)|
| 3:30:49| So, the community swim, for those who might want access to the pool but don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12649)|
| 3:30:54| necessarily be involved in the weekly lessons, they could access the pool then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12654)|
| 3:31:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12660)|
| 3:31:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12661)|
| 3:31:04| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12664)|
| 3:31:06| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12666)|
| 3:31:09| So, my community should be happy that they get a few hours of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12669)|
| 3:31:14| I mean, I'm just sorry I had to say something because this conversation is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12674)|
| 3:31:19| I would love to hear, since we always want to talk about the resources in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12679)|
| 3:31:23| tell me how many public swimming pools we have in West Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12683)|
| 3:31:29| And do residents in West Knoxville only have access to those on Saturday morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12689)|
| 3:31:37| I'm sorry, I had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| Yeah, Mr. Brace or Ms. Ely, can you answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12698)|
| 3:31:42| I'm not aware of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12702)|
| 3:31:43| The city doesn't own any pools in West Knoxville or public pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12703)|
| 3:31:46| There are no public pools in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| Yeah, we have a public pool near the L.T. Ross building on Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| We have a pool north, an outdoor pool kind of north-north off of Inskip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12712)|
| 3:31:59| And then, Ms. Ely, we have E.V. Davidson east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12719)|
| 3:32:02| We have the Adaptive Rec Center east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| And we have one indoor pool south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12724)|
| 3:32:07| I'd like to speak on that because I understand, you know, you're saying that the hours of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12727)|
| 3:32:13| availability for the community, but like, I forget the, it might have been Ms. Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12733)|
| 3:32:18| who spoke a minute ago about it's very difficult to get lifeguards, especially with a lot of crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12738)|
| 3:32:23| that's going on in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| And we are currently right now really trying to revamp on how we can change the hours of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12745)|
| 3:32:30| operations for the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12750)|
| 3:32:33| But again, you know, the pool has always been available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12753)|
| 3:32:36| But we're really trying to change the stigma and the mindset of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12756)|
| 3:32:40| We don't swim in the wintertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12760)|
| 3:32:43| We don't swim, we don't get our hair wet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12763)|
| 3:32:45| We don't swim when we get close to Easter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| There's bigger issues and bigger than a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12768)|
| 3:32:52| It's more of a stigma in the community that African-Americans don't swim in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12772)|
| 3:32:56| So we're trying to change the culture in the community from that standpoint, starting first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12776)|
| 3:33:02| Thank you, Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12782)|

| 3:33:54| and donating the same to East Tennessee Valley Crime Stoppers Association to cover expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12834)|
| 3:34:00| related to establishing the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12840)|

| 3:34:14| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12854)|
| 3:34:16| May I have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12856)|
| 3:34:17| Could someone briefly just kind of give us a high-level overview of, you know, how these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12857)|
| 3:34:23| where these funds would be put and just briefly how the program works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12863)|
| 3:34:26| Yes, both Empowerment Director Charles Lomax and Chief Thomas are available to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12866)|
| 3:34:32| about this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| Dr. Lomax, do you want to kick things off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12874)|
| 3:34:35| And then if we have more questions, Chief Thomas can address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12875)|
| 3:34:41| Yes, Charles Lomax, Director of Community Empowerment and Mayor, I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12881)|
| 3:34:44| Deputy Chief Miller is actually on to speak to this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12884)|
| 3:34:51| But again, this is part of the $1 million that is housed within the Community Empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12891)|
| 3:34:56| Fund that Council approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12896)|
| 3:34:58| And with these funds, we are looking to, again, work toward the efforts of violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12898)|
| 3:35:06| interruption and prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12906)|
| 3:35:09| And this is more than a one department issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12909)|
| 3:35:13| This is a thing that we are working on cross-departmentally, and we're grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12913)|
| 3:35:19| And so I'll let Chief Miller take it from here with the ins and outs of the Crime Stoppers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12919)|
| 3:35:25| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12925)|

| 3:35:32| And thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12932)|
| 3:35:34| The Crime Stoppers request we're making here, the $13,000, will go toward establishing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12934)|
| 3:35:42| framework by which we can collect confidential information on crime and reward those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12942)|
| 3:35:49| who provide that in a confidential manner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12949)|
| 3:35:52| So the system is set up in such a way, there's three ways that you can provide tips through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12952)|
| 3:35:58| this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12958)|
| 3:35:59| One would be a phone app called P3 Tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12959)|
| 3:36:02| The other one is a 1-800 number to a call center in Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12962)|
| 3:36:06| And the third would be through a website that this fee will establish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12966)|
| 3:36:10| So there'll be three ways for folks to provide this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12970)|
| 3:36:13| And the good thing about it is what we've not been able to do in the past and what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12973)|
| 3:36:17| realized with this recent uptick in violence is that we didn't really have a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12977)|
| 3:36:21| to collect money and pay out reward money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12981)|
| 3:36:24| Even the DA struggled with that because they don't have that infrastructure either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12984)|
| 3:36:29| So this kind of fills that void and provides that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12989)|
| 3:36:33| It also makes us comfortable in assuring people that we can keep them anonymous because in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12993)|
| 3:36:38| all reality, we don't even know, we won't even know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=12998)|
| 3:36:41| Crime Stoppers is a freestanding 501c3, not subject to open records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13001)|
| 3:36:46| It's not a city department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13006)|
| 3:36:48| So it will be a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| The $13,000 that we're asking for, in fact, we already have money and donations that far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13010)|
| 3:36:57| exceed that secured already will be collected next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13017)|
| 3:37:01| So going forward, the $13,000 in this request will hopefully be funded by Crime Stoppers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13021)|
| 3:37:09| donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13029)|
| 3:37:10| And so that'll be a part of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13030)|
| 3:37:13| So we think it'll be a great tool for us to help fight crime, collect information and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13033)|
| 3:37:18| data, and also build trust with the community, knowing that they can communicate with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13038)|
| 3:37:23| without compromising their identity, putting them at risk for retaliation, which is a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13043)|
| 3:37:29| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13049)|
| 3:37:30| So we feel confident that this program will fill that void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13050)|
| 3:37:34| Lastly, I want to tell y'all, we call it East Tennessee Valley Crime Stoppers is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13054)|
| 3:37:39| we want to make it regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| We want other departments in this region to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13061)|
| 3:37:44| It's kind of designed for that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13064)|
| 3:37:47| The program has been around for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13067)|
| 3:37:50| So as we get established, we'll reach out to surrounding sheriff departments, surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13070)|
| 3:37:54| cities, and see if their agencies would like to join in and help us raise money and fundraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13074)|
| 3:38:01| and secure the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13081)|
| 3:38:02| So really, after this initial, it'll be a freestanding funding itself type operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13082)|
| 3:38:08| Thank you, Deputy Chief Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13088)|
| 3:38:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13092)|
| 3:38:13| Any other questions about this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13093)|
| 3:38:17| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13100)|
| 3:38:21| Was this a recommendation of Cities United?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| No, it was something we looked at internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13104)|
| 3:38:28| And actually, one of our grant writers brought it to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13108)|
| 3:38:31| She worked for a department in Florida that has used it for decades, and so it was extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13111)|
| 3:38:35| successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13115)|
| 3:38:36| So this came from within the department, and we brought it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13116)|
| 3:38:42| And is there more funding that's going to be put into it from city funds or from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13122)|
| 3:38:47| million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13127)|
| 3:38:48| I think the $13,000 is just for setting it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13128)|
| 3:38:53| No, $13,000 will be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13133)|
| 3:38:54| Actually, $8,000 of that will be seed money for reward, and the $5,000 will be to secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13134)|
| 3:39:00| a website, the call center, the P3, the application on your phone, P3 tips, paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13140)|
| 3:39:07| So there is some administrative costs to set up the tip system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13147)|
| 3:39:11| And so also to set up the bank accounts, where we will have bank accounts with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13151)|
| 3:39:17| SunTrust is who will be using, and they will be working with us to make sure that we keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13157)|
| 3:39:22| those tips anonymous and pay out the money, and that we will have our accounts established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13162)|
| 3:39:27| through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13167)|
| 3:39:28| And so in short, going forward, we shouldn't need any more money for administrative costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13168)|
| 3:39:34| of crime stoppers, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| I know for a long time, we've been asking people to call in with confidential tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13178)|
| 3:39:45| Has that been very productive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| And has this been productive in other parts of the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13187)|
| 3:39:52| Yes, actually, nearby in Nashville, if y'all remember the nurse that was, I think she got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13192)|
| 3:39:58| shot and killed on the interstate, and it was a road rage incident, they had no leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13198)|
| 3:40:02| Crime stoppers, people donated $75,000 to crime stoppers, and that actually broke that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13202)|
| 3:40:08| case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13208)|
| 3:40:08| And we were actually able to identify a suspect and make an arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13208)|
| 3:40:12| So yeah, it's very beneficial because a lot of times what happens, like the donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13212)|
| 3:40:17| we've already got, we're kind of driven by some of the violence in East Knoxville, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13217)|
| 3:40:22| with the young men over there that we've had issues with in terms of being victimized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13222)|
| 3:40:27| People were compelled to donate money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13227)|
| 3:40:28| It touched their hearts, and they felt like it was a worthy cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| And so you'll get those, and you'll have a lot of cases where cases are just touching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13231)|
| 3:40:37| you know, and they're just, they're sad and tragic, and people are motivated to donate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13237)|
| 3:40:41| money to get leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13241)|
| 3:40:42| And so it's a, I think financially, it'll be self-sustaining long term in terms of reward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13242)|
| 3:40:49| money, in terms of maintaining the cost associated with all the way we collect tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13249)|
| 3:40:55| Plus it modernizes, you know, with the phone app for young people, it's more appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13255)|
| 3:41:02| And of course, that's one nice feature too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13262)|
| 3:41:06| And how did our confidential line that we've had, how is that doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13266)|
| 3:41:13| Well, I mean, it's limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13273)|
| 3:41:14| I mean, everything in city government is open to public record inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13274)|
| 3:41:19| You know, we have open records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13279)|
| 3:41:20| I mean, we're kind of an open book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| So this provides us the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| You'll be truly anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| We won't know your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| In fact, when we get the tip, our officers won't know that person's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13287)|
| 3:41:31| That person won't be identifiable through a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13291)|
| 3:41:34| I mean, so it's a very, they put a lot of thought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13294)|
| 3:41:38| It's a very precise system, and they've kind of perfected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13298)|
| 3:41:44| Thank you, Chief Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13304)|
| 3:41:45| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13305)|
| 3:41:48| I just want to mention, Chief Miller may not have been aware that I'm a huge advocate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13308)|
| 3:41:52| Crime Stoppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13312)|
| 3:41:52| And it mentioned in meetings with the Chief and the Mayor have talked about and encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13312)|
| 3:41:58| Crime Stoppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13318)|
| 3:41:58| And I would encourage my colleagues to please go look on websites, not just Nashville, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13318)|
| 3:42:03| especially in Memphis, where there's a lot of high crime there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13323)|
| 3:42:07| And it has been very successful in helping to solve cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13327)|
| 3:42:11| You will actually even see the cases that have been solved as a result of Crime Stoppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13331)|
| 3:42:17| Yes, we've had the anonymous hotline that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13337)|
| 3:42:20| But again, there's some caveats, as Deputy Chief Miller stated, that those may have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13340)|
| 3:42:27| be identifiable in some instances, if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13347)|
| 3:42:31| With Crime Stoppers, that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| And so I'm very hopeful that we will see this as a mechanism and a tool that will get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13353)|
| 3:42:41| more information, that will solve some of the murders and the crimes that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13361)|
| 3:42:45| committed in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13365)|
| 3:42:47| And also to hopefully be a measure that will make people think twice when they're now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13367)|
| 3:42:53| starting to see, hopefully, people being arrested, because we're getting the level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13373)|
| 3:42:58| information that we need to be able to get people off the streets who committed acts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13378)|
| 3:43:02| of violence in these murders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13382)|
| 3:43:03| So I'm extremely happy to see this finally on the agenda and getting it up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13383)|
| 3:43:10| So thank you all for your diligence in making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13390)|
| 3:43:14| That's all I wanted to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13398)|
| 3:43:21| I wanted to just give Deputy Chief, Deputy Mayor Gill a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13401)|
| 3:43:27| She's been helping us think through all the violence interruption stuff and public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13407)|
| 3:43:33| innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13413)|
| 3:43:34| So Ms. Gill, could you just remind us of some of the Crime Stoppers things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13414)|
| 3:43:40| Just want to make sure Council has the full picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13420)|
| 3:43:45| Ms. Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13425)|
| 3:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13426)|
| 3:43:47| Thank you, Mayor Aaron Gill and Chief Policy Officer Deputy Chief Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13427)|
| 3:43:52| Really, I think Charles and Chief Miller have done an excellent job describing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13432)|
| 3:43:56| I want to clarify the question that you asked, Councilwoman Singh, because while this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13436)|
| 3:44:02| not a strategy that has been proposed by the City of United County, I want to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13442)|
| 3:44:08| that this was part of the slate of programs that we talked about in broad terms and crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13448)|
| 3:44:15| stoppers I think was the most specific program that we talked and mentioned as we brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13455)|
| 3:44:20| that initial budget amendment to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13460)|
| 3:44:23| So as Vice Mayor McKenzie alluded to, this was one of those objects or items that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13463)|
| 3:44:27| knew we could move forward on quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13467)|
| 3:44:29| And so we are glad to bring it to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| I also want to clarify from a funding perspective that it is a very small portion when you come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13471)|
| 3:44:37| to ongoing funding because, again, as Chief Miller said, it will be self-sustaining and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13477)|
| 3:44:41| this is the upfront operational cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| I did, however, in the interest of transparency, want to also acknowledge that there's a coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13483)|
| 3:44:47| position that goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| And so that will be an ongoing fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13489)|
| 3:44:51| But that is one singular staff position that we would anticipate being part of this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13491)|
| 3:44:58| and its ongoing operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13498)|
| 3:44:59| So I just wanted to make that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13501)|
| 3:45:02| Thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13502)|
| 3:45:06| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13506)|
| 3:45:08| In some of the discussions we've been having around increasing crime in our community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13508)|
| 3:45:18| what can we do about it, some of the issues that have been lifted up have been the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13518)|
| 3:45:28| of time that it takes to process evidence and get back, you know, I don't know all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13528)|
| 3:45:39| technical terms, but get back the data on the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13539)|
| 3:45:42| And, you know, we've heard that, you know, members of our community have learned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13542)|
| 3:45:50| even though if they report a crime anonymously, if their information is what leads to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13550)|
| 3:46:02| charges, then their name could appear in court documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13562)|
| 3:46:08| And so, you know, I'm just concerned that this program doesn't speak to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13568)|
| 3:46:17| many of the larger issues that have come out over the past year, having discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13577)|
| 3:46:22| with the public and trying to understand how can we make more, you know, quicker resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13582)|
| 3:46:35| in our policing that allow cases to be resolved more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13595)|
| 3:46:41| And so I'm trying to understand how, you know, even with Crime Stoppers in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13601)|
| 3:46:48| it seems like if someone brings forth evidence, they're still going to be brought into a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13608)|
| 3:46:55| process. There's no way around that. Am I misunderstanding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13615)|
| 3:46:59| No. Now, in terms of Crime Stoppers, Council Member Parker, that's when we're giving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13619)|
| 3:47:06| information. We're not giving a name. We don't, they're not calling us. We're either actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13626)|
| 3:47:10| going through Northern Communications or P3 Tips, which is not. So when they collect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13630)|
| 3:47:16| information and they share it with us, they're not sharing. They're just giving us the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13636)|
| 3:47:20| not being provided it. So unless the person reveals themselves, we won't be able to reveal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13640)|
| 3:47:26| them because we won't know who they are. So you'll have to do additional investigative work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13646)|
| 3:47:33| in order to make an arrest, because you just can't make an arrest off of what you get from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13653)|
| 3:47:38| Crime Stoppers. Yeah. Well, actually, we could, depending on the information. If it's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13658)|
| 3:47:43| detailed information enough to initiate an investigation that results in an arrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13663)|
| 3:47:49| then that would be a scenario. The good thing is, like I said, we're just not going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13669)|
| 3:47:54| that information. I mean, the anonymity associated with it is why it's been successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13674)|
| 3:48:00| because we don't know who's given us information. But what it does, it gives us the leads we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13680)|
| 3:48:06| to go out and follow up on and act on that. Have we taken any steps as a city to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13686)|
| 3:48:17| resolve the issue with the amount of time it takes to get back results on evidence being tested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13697)|
| 3:48:25| Are we still in the same situation we've always been? I thought there was discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13705)|
| 3:48:29| something becoming more in-house than it had been before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13709)|
| 3:48:33| Well, the DNA, you're referring to DNA type stuff that we have to send off to TBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13713)|
| 3:48:38| and some of the latent print stuff. We're kind of at TBI's mercy. We don't really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13718)|
| 3:48:44| they have to prioritize in the way the lab sees fit. Now, there's times if we make a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13724)|
| 3:48:51| request and they accommodate us, but that's not something we can do all the time. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13731)|
| 3:48:55| they've got, you know, everybody's case is a priority. And I know TBI is looking at expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13735)|
| 3:49:02| other lab operations, which I think is needed and is good. But that's unfortunate. We still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13742)|
| 3:49:07| have the delays associated with that that we've really always had. It's not really new. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13747)|
| 3:49:12| always had some delays with DNA, with TBI. Thank you. Did Chief Thomas want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13752)|
| 3:49:21| If I may, I think maybe what you're referring to, Councilwoman Parker, is the NIVENS with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13761)|
| 3:49:29| ability to evaluate our own firearms as evidence in shell casings. We are working with the ATF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13769)|
| 3:49:37| We have ability, in fact, Deputy Chief Miller is the one who set that process in motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13777)|
| 3:49:42| for us a couple of years ago. We got some people trained on that and working with the ATF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13782)|
| 3:49:46| So, some of that we do not have to send firearms or shell casings through TBI because we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13786)|
| 3:49:51| the ability to do that. As far as fingerprints, we are asking for the ability to train somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13791)|
| 3:49:59| as a fingerprint technician as well. So, that's something that we will be able to submit ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13799)|
| 3:50:03| if we get a person trained, specifically a civilian person trained to do that. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13803)|
| 3:50:08| there are some ways. We have some workarounds. DNA, of course, is too expensive for us to even try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13808)|
| 3:50:13| create our own lab to do that. But we do have some things in place that we are working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13813)|
| 3:50:18| technology-wise. So, yes, some of those are, I think that may have been what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13818)|
| 3:50:23| Well, thank you so much. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13823)|
| 3:50:27| Thank you. Any other questions or comments? Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13827)|
| 3:50:32| Thank you. Deputy Mayor Gill mentioned some things. So, there's an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13832)|
| 3:50:37| city position that's going to be paid for. So, it's going to be more than $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13837)|
| 3:50:44| So, that's my question. Can you tell me about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13844)|
| 3:50:47| This is something that will be coming up in the budget proposal for the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13847)|
| 3:50:54| Is this out of the $1 million that is for violence prevention and prevention, the paid position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13854)|
| 3:51:02| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13862)|
| 3:51:06| I would add to that. I would not have considered this to fit under that program. This is straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13866)|
| 3:51:15| up policing work. This is to support and help make the work of our police force more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13875)|
| 3:51:25| more effective. But I didn't see this as a violence intervention measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13885)|
| 3:51:31| Chief Thomas, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13891)|
| 3:51:38| So, that position is actually, we're asking for it in our budget. And it is a civilian position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13898)|
| 3:51:44| We'll be housed at the police department to administer this program with a board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13904)|
| 3:51:48| And Chief Miller can speak more as to the board of directors because we have put them in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13908)|
| 3:51:53| Part of the Crime Stoppers program was that we had to supply an administrative position. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13913)|
| 3:51:59| we are submitting that as a request in the police department budget this year. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13919)|
| 3:52:16| Just for clarity, if I may, it's part of the police department's budget request for next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13936)|
| 3:52:22| year or as part of the $1 million we approved recently? Or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13942)|
| 3:52:29| I'll just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13949)|
| 3:52:32| Yeah, when we brought you the $1 million budget amendment several months ago, again, Crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13952)|
| 3:52:36| Stoppers was one of the key initiatives that we included as we described how we were going to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13956)|
| 3:52:41| those funds. So, again, when it comes to the ability to move forward and getting it set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13961)|
| 3:52:47| we have the budget and the, again, I would argue, have tried to explain that these programs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13967)|
| 3:52:54| intertwined and that for the $13,000 that's in front of you today, that is available in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13974)|
| 3:53:00| budget through the violence interruption funds that you all have approved several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13980)|
| 3:53:09| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13989)|
| 3:53:14| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=13994)|

| 3:55:11| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14111)|
| 3:55:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14112)|
| 3:55:14| I believe we need a motion first, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14114)|
| 3:55:17| No, not to hear the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14117)|
| 3:55:21| Okay, Ms. Phillips, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14121)|
| 3:55:28| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14128)|
| 3:55:29| Yes. Yes, we can. If you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14129)|
| 3:55:33| and then you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14133)|
| 3:55:36| Mayor, I'm sorry. Mr. Mullins is seeking recognition. This is his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14136)|
| 3:55:42| He did not sign up to speak, but maybe he wants to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14142)|
| 3:55:46| I think like we did in a previous agenda item, we can let Council Members know that he's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14146)|
| 3:55:52| to answer questions if they have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14152)|
| 3:55:55| I'm sorry. Yeah, he was raising his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14155)|
| 3:55:57| Okay, well, let's deal with the speakers who signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14157)|
| 3:56:01| and then if people have questions for Mr. Mullins, they're welcome to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14161)|
| 3:56:08| Ms. Phillips, go ahead. You have started by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14168)|
| 3:56:12| please, and you'll have up to five minutes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14172)|
| 3:56:14| My name is Debbie Phillips. I live at 1307 Michaels Lane, 37912. I've lived in Norwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14174)|
| 3:56:21| all of my life, and I am the current president of the Norwood Homeowners Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14181)|
| 3:56:28| The homeowners and myself would like to thank, first of all, Council Members Thomas and Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14188)|
| 3:56:35| for attending meetings with the homeowner and the developer at the property site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14195)|
| 3:56:40| and thank the developer for the several meetings that he had with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14200)|
| 3:56:45| Norwood consists of a community that takes pride in its community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14205)|
| 3:56:49| Most homeowners have lived in the community for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14209)|
| 3:56:53| Some are like us and live there all their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14213)|
| 3:56:57| We do not oppose growth, but we feel that this proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14217)|
| 3:57:02| and the future of it is not a good fit for this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14222)|
| 3:57:09| We have single family and two apartment complexes within a 0.4-mile radius of the proposed complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14229)|
| 3:57:19| Clear Springs is 0.4 miles away with 103 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14239)|
| 3:57:24| and then Willow Creek that adjoins this proposed property has 133 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14244)|
| 3:57:30| so we've already got 236 crammed into this portion of Merchants Road that's the bottleneck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14250)|
| 3:57:39| Not to mention, we have larger complexes around the corner on Pleasant Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14259)|
| 3:57:45| that also access Merchants Road to get to the highway and interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14265)|
| 3:57:49| We have Wilkerson Road directly across the street with 300-plus single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14269)|
| 3:57:57| and Merchants Road for them to turn left is really a nightmare, especially with the blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14277)|
| 3:58:04| Millstone is the same with over 300 houses and faces that same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14284)|
| 3:58:11| This bottleneck of Merchants Road does not have the infrastructure to handle what we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14291)|
| 3:58:17| We can imagine an additional apartment complex, single-family homes, duplexes, or infrastructures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14297)|
| 3:58:24| The center turn lane ends prior to where this proposed property begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14304)|
| 3:58:29| The developer said he would put a turn lane into the complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14309)|
| 3:58:33| That's not going to resolve the traffic problem in this bottleneck area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14313)|
| 3:58:38| MPC says 21 acres of RM5 could result in 658 units and up to 318 single-family duplex and townhouse mixtures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14318)|
| 3:58:53| MPC staff recommended RM3, but the board voted RM5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14333)|
| 3:58:59| Maybe there was a reason MPC staff recommended RM3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14339)|
| 3:59:04| Once RM5, we have RM5 forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14344)|
| 3:59:08| That gives a potential for future growth on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14348)|
| 3:59:13| The future could end up being 658 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14353)|
| 3:59:17| Build 250 and sell it with the availability for the buyer to build more units on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14357)|
| 3:59:27| We have a shortage of houses for qualified buyers right here in Knoxville to purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14367)|
| 3:59:32| to raise their family, and have a yard to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14372)|
| 3:59:36| The market is crazy because we have more buyers than we do sellers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14376)|
| 3:59:41| RM3 on this property with a mix of single-family duplex townhouses would benefit future buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14381)|
| 3:59:50| and give green space as we could have some grass and trees instead of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14390)|
| 3:59:58| It helps the ecosystem and with better asset in preventing water runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14398)|
| 4:00:03| adding to the flooding issues we already have in this area to homes around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14403)|
| 4:00:09| In addition, it would not leave the large carbon footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14409)|
| 4:00:14| Having 318 of a mixed development would bring more traffic than his proposed 250-unit complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14414)|
| 4:00:23| but the future is what the homeowners are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14423)|
| 4:00:26| We have had several meetings with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14426)|
| 4:00:29| We've asked him about condos in place of apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14429)|
| 4:00:33| That was not cost feasible for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14433)|
| 4:00:36| We asked him about a mix of single-family duplex and townhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| and again, the cost was not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14440)|
| 4:00:43| He wants the 20-acre zone, RM5, so he can spread out the proposed 250 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14443)|
| 4:00:50| but he reminds us that he can still build 250 on the parcel that is currently CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14450)|
| 4:00:58| Why destroy all the green space available and replace it with asphalt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14458)|
| 4:01:02| We believe that a mix of single-family duplex and townhouses would better benefit this portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14462)|
| 4:01:12| of Murchis Road versus 250-plus apartment units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14472)|
| 4:01:17| We're going to have to have the infrastructure for a center lane on this portion of Murchis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14477)|
| 4:01:22| regardless of what is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14482)|
| 4:01:24| A little more traffic is reasonable to the homeowners versus an apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14484)|
| 4:01:30| and a concern for its future growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14490)|
| 4:01:32| We have those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14492)|
| 4:01:34| That concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14494)|
| 4:01:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| Next person to sign up to speak on this is Ms. Connie Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14499)|
| 4:01:43| Ms. Holland, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14503)|
| 4:01:49| Connie Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14509)|
| 4:01:53| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14515)|
| 4:01:56| Ms. Holland, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14516)|
| 4:01:59| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14519)|
| 4:02:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14522)|
| 4:02:03| Good evening, and thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14523)|
| 4:02:05| My name is Connie Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14525)|
| 4:02:06| I live at 2004 McLean Drive, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14526)|
| 4:02:11| I've lived here in this neighborhood all my life and a member of the Norwood Homeowners Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14531)|
| 4:02:16| I am speaking in opposition to the rezoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14536)|
| 4:02:21| And Debbie already said that the MPC staff recommended RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14541)|
| 4:02:27| but the board voted for RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14547)|
| 4:02:30| Norwood is and has always been an area of single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14550)|
| 4:02:37| We have agreed to have apartments here in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14557)|
| 4:02:41| We are not against growth, but just want more consistency to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14561)|
| 4:02:49| This area has been vacant for many years and is home to multiple species of animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14569)|
| 4:02:55| and we are losing green space faster than they can find a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14575)|
| 4:03:01| I have issues already here in my yard with raccoons, possums, and skunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14581)|
| 4:03:07| My dog got sprayed, what, four weeks ago now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14587)|
| 4:03:12| Green spaces are beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14592)|
| 4:03:14| They utilize the pollution from Merchants Clinton Highway and Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14594)|
| 4:03:19| The trees scrub the air and produce oxygen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14599)|
| 4:03:22| You take away the green space, and you have more pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14602)|
| 4:03:26| increased water runoff, erosion, intended and unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14606)|
| 4:03:32| I used to live on Murray, and there was a large complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14612)|
| 4:03:37| in front of my house, and they had a big retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14617)|
| 4:03:41| Worked great for them, but then my yard, every time it rained, flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14621)|
| 4:03:46| And they already have flooding in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14626)|
| 4:03:49| Removing trees will increase the temperature of the earth by two degrees by the end of the century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14629)|
| 4:03:55| Biogeoscientists have found that cleared land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14635)|
| 4:03:59| for human uses was 10 degrees warmer than forested areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14639)|
| 4:04:07| NOAA research found that deforestation has doubled or quadrupled the frequency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14647)|
| 4:04:13| of hot, dry summers in the world, mostly affecting North America and Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14653)|
| 4:04:23| It affects human health in a more direct way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14663)|
| 4:04:26| Deforestation drives the wild animals out of their natural habitat closer to humans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14666)|
| 4:04:32| creating greater frequency of zoonotic diseases spilling over into the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14672)|
| 4:04:39| And that's germs, viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14679)|
| 4:04:44| And it also affects the bee population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14684)|
| 4:04:50| In closing, the city of Knoxville says that we are environmentally conscious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14690)|
| 4:04:54| and the city recommends to decrease urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14694)|
| 4:04:57| But we are using all of our green spaces for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14697)|
| 4:05:02| Other places have realized the mistake that this growth has caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14702)|
| 4:05:08| The carbon footprint will be large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14708)|
| 4:05:11| Destruction of the forested lands leads to more concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14711)|
| 4:05:17| more asphalt, and that plays a big role in climate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14717)|
| 4:05:23| We are removing all of the protection in the name of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14723)|
| 4:05:28| The problem that I'm talking about here is global,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14728)|
| 4:05:31| but the solution starts right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14731)|

| 4:05:39| To preserve this area, I'm urging you to zone both parcels of property R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14739)|
| 4:05:44| At least we would have green yards, trees, shrubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14744)|
| 4:05:50| and it would be more consistent with our Norwood neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14750)|
| 4:05:53| Thank you so much for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14753)|

| 4:05:58| Council members, that concludes the speakers who signed up to this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14758)|
| 4:06:03| Is there a motion on this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14763)|
| 4:06:06| This agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14766)|
| 4:06:07| I'm going to comment first, Your Honor, or Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14767)|
| 4:06:12| This is 40 acres right now, and it's all natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14772)|
| 4:06:16| And I've been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14776)|
| 4:06:17| I know Councilperson Singh has been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14777)|
| 4:06:21| We've met with the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14781)|
| 4:06:22| We've met with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14782)|
| 4:06:25| The neighbors would prefer that it all stayed natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14785)|
| 4:06:29| And, of course, I have to balance this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14789)|
| 4:06:33| The recommendation of the planning staff was R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14793)|
| 4:06:41| And I think that is a very good compromise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14801)|
| 4:06:44| The neighborhood is willing to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14804)|
| 4:06:47| Practically, they understand there's going to be growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14807)|
| 4:06:51| They would prefer that it stayed all natural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14811)|
| 4:06:53| the way it's been when the Girl Scouts have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14813)|
| 4:06:56| But I think what the neighborhood is saying here is very, very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14816)|
| 4:07:01| And it's consistent with what our planning staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14821)|
| 4:07:09| The developer wants R and 5, as a developer might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14829)|
| 4:07:14| But I think the proper balance here is consistent with the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14834)|
| 4:07:20| I cannot support a motion for R and 5, and I will not make such a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14840)|
| 4:07:26| I would consider R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14846)|
| 4:07:31| I'm open to comments, whatever my other council people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14851)|
| 4:07:35| But to me, R and 3 just sounds extremely reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14855)|
| 4:07:38| It allows for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14858)|
| 4:07:41| It's still going to change this area quite a bit, drastically, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14861)|
| 4:07:46| But the neighbors are accepting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14866)|
| 4:07:48| So I think that would be my recommendation, is to amend it to R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14868)|
| 4:07:57| Are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14877)|
| 4:07:59| Uh, yes, I think I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14879)|
| 4:08:01| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14881)|

| 4:08:03| Mayor, we need a main motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14883)|
| 4:08:07| Okay, the main motion would be, let's see, we're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14887)|
| 4:08:18| I'm just looking at trying to figure out what exactly, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14898)|
| 4:08:23| Okay, let's see, we have to, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14903)|
| 4:08:27| This is an amendment to the Northwest City Sector from low density to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14907)|
| 4:08:31| So we're not, we're not at the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14913)|
| 4:08:35| No, we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14915)|
| 4:08:40| So what we have to do is amend, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14920)|
| 4:08:47| the Northwest Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14927)|
| 4:08:50| Amy, is Director Brooks available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14930)|
| 4:08:55| Yeah, and Rob Frost is raising his hand to give some counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14935)|
| 4:08:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14939)|
| 4:09:00| I believe, and Director Brooks can correct me if I'm wrong, what was recommended by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14940)|
| 4:09:10| and what was passed for commission for the Sector Plan Amendment and the One-Year Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14950)|
| 4:09:17| would comport with Mr. Thomas's anticipated motion for R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14957)|
| 4:09:26| So, but I think Director Brooks needs to speak about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14966)|
| 4:09:32| Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14972)|
| 4:09:34| Yeah, so MDR O's, R and supports both R and 3 and R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14974)|
| 4:09:41| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14981)|
| 4:09:42| Does that clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14982)|
| 4:09:44| So, so the most, so if, if, well, Council Member Thomas, you ask your questions, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14984)|
| 4:09:53| We have to get through two agenda items before we get to the zoning, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14993)|
| 4:09:58| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14998)|
| 4:09:59| Planning staff recommended that we amend these two agenda items and then we get to the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=14999)|
| 4:10:10| question, which would be the third one on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15010)|
| 4:10:13| And then at that point, I will be making a motion to amend that from R and 5 to R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15013)|
| 4:10:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15020)|
| 4:10:21| So, the, I think, I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15021)|
| 4:10:22| Before you, the, the Sector Plan and One-Year Plan supports both R and 3 and R and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15022)|
| 4:10:27| which was recommended by Planning Commission and the Sector Plan and One-Year Plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15027)|
| 4:10:32| So, I will move, I will make a motion to approve 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15032)|

| 4:13:38| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15218)|
| 4:13:40| Yes, I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15220)|
| 4:13:45| Okay, there are a lot of questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15225)|
| 4:13:47| Okay, is there a second on Council Member Thomas's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15227)|
| 4:13:51| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15231)|
| 4:13:52| Seconded by Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15232)|
| 4:13:56| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15236)|
| 4:13:58| You're raising your hand for, okay, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15238)|
| 4:14:01| I just wanted to, Council Member Thomas recognized Mr. Mullins earlier, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15241)|
| 4:14:07| and I just wanted to check and make sure that we weren't addressing someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15247)|
| 4:14:13| had their hand raised before we move on and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15253)|
| 4:14:16| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15256)|
| 4:14:18| I also have questions for Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15258)|
| 4:14:20| Okay, Mr. Mullins is on the call and available to answer a question if Council Member has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15260)|
| 4:14:26| Ms. Ryder, did you have a question for him or you just wanted to see if Mr. Thomas did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15266)|
| 4:14:32| I just wanted to make sure that we covered our bases because I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15272)|
| 4:14:35| what we had said earlier was that he was speaking after the others, but maybe I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15275)|
| 4:14:43| If you guys have a specific question for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15283)|
| 4:14:46| does someone have a question for, anyone have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15286)|
| 4:14:49| Ms. Parker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15289)|
| 4:14:51| Um, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15291)|
| 4:14:52| I was able to tour this property with Mr. Mullins, and I did reach out to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15292)|
| 4:14:59| but unfortunately, we weren't able to connect, and I wasn't able to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15299)|
| 4:15:03| direct perspective from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15303)|
| 4:15:07| But in touring the property, Mr. Mullins had a conversation with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15307)|
| 4:15:12| and I haven't prompted him on this, so I don't know if he'll remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15312)|
| 4:15:17| But there was a discussion that we had about what could be potential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15317)|
| 4:15:25| plans for the property under an R3 versus an R5, and I remember you explaining that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15325)|
| 4:15:34| you know, there would be different types of buildings that the developer would likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15334)|
| 4:15:38| pursue depending on the different type of zoning, and it might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15338)|
| 4:15:42| get the result the neighborhood wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15342)|
| 4:15:44| Can you speak to that more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15344)|
| 4:15:46| Yes, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15346)|
| 4:15:48| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15348)|
| 4:15:49| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15349)|
| 4:15:54| I did not realize as the applicant I needed to sign up before I could speak on a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15354)|
| 4:16:00| I will make sure to do that again in the future to keep proper decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15360)|
| 4:16:06| You know, the options for the property, if we don't get the RN5 zoning, I mean, there's a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15366)|
| 4:16:13| Staff did recommend RN3 after discussing this at length and actually postponing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15373)|
| 4:16:21| with Planning Commission twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15381)|
| 4:16:24| Planning Commission ultimately voted 13-1 to provide the RN5 zoning that we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15384)|
| 4:16:32| One of the reasons for that is, you know, the property total is about 39.33 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15392)|
| 4:16:38| We, at Commission's recommendation, went back and actually reduced the amount that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15398)|
| 4:16:45| asking for the rezoning to only be 21.98 acres, which captured most of the non-hillside areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15405)|
| 4:16:52| and reduced the amount of disturbance to 19 acres, leaving the balance of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15412)|
| 4:16:58| to be undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15418)|
| 4:17:00| The property as it is right now is a mix of neighborhood commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15420)|
| 4:17:05| and the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15425)|
| 4:17:09| The front seven acres on 2400 Merchants is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15429)|
| 4:17:14| And one of the changes that occurred with the new zoning ordinance is neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15434)|
| 4:17:20| allows for there to be multifamily as a permitted use on those seven acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15440)|
| 4:17:27| So when we looked at this property, we first looked at what could we do with multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15447)|
| 4:17:31| on those seven acres, and we had an architect apply the parking, the dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15451)|
| 4:17:37| the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15457)|
| 4:17:38| And if we were to put multifamily on those front seven acres, which all fronts there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15458)|
| 4:17:42| on Merchants, we could get approximately 216 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15462)|
| 4:17:46| That's not what the applicant wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15466)|
| 4:17:50| They wanted to do 250 units on the 19 acres that they can be disturbed, because that gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15470)|
| 4:17:57| them a lot more flexibility to deal with the existing vegetation, the existing topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15477)|
| 4:18:02| There's a lot of rocky terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15482)|
| 4:18:04| That just gives a lot more flexibility to be able to spread that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15484)|
| 4:18:08| If we don't get the RN-5 zoning, and this body votes for RN-3 today, then our options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15488)|
| 4:18:16| are we could withdraw our zoning application altogether and look at what our options are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15496)|
| 4:18:21| with what the property is, or we can move forward with the RN-3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15501)|
| 4:18:25| But the problem with the RN-3 zoning, and I think I heard the neighbors that spoke tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15505)|
| 4:18:31| talk about this, it would have a greater impact on both traffic and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15511)|
| 4:18:38| We had a traffic impact letter that was performed for the RN-5 zoning, and it was about 8.47| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15518)|
| 4:18:46| trips a day for the 250 units that we have proposed, which is 2,175 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15526)|
| 4:18:55| If you look at staff's report, and this is, I believe on, you can see this in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15535)|
| 4:19:00| at page 505-37, they estimate a traffic impact for RN-3 zoning to be between 2,508 and 5,191| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15540)|
| 4:19:15| trips per day under the RN-3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15555)|
| 4:19:18| That makes sense because those types of developments, more than multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15558)|
| 4:19:25| would attract your traditional nuclear families, people that want to have children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15565)|
| 4:19:30| want to be there, versus maybe people who are, you know, younger urban professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15570)|
| 4:19:36| who are looking for an apartment life before they decide to settle down and have a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15576)|
| 4:19:41| So there will be a greater impact on traffic and on schools with the RN-3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15581)|
| 4:19:47| Additionally, when you're talking about building costs and economies of scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15587)|
| 4:19:53| you would have to build a lot more density with RN-3 if you're looking at duplexes or townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15593)|
| 4:20:02| to make the investment work. And that would actually lead to more disturbance than we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15602)|
| 4:20:09| need to do for our proposal for the 250 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15609)|
| 4:20:13| So, you know, that makes sense because you're building multiple units under one foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15613)|
| 4:20:19| So instead of building 313 townhomes or duplexes, you're building 10 multifamily units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15619)|
| 4:20:29| going up 35 feet tall, which is the maximum height allowed in the RN-5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15629)|
| 4:20:34| And you can spread those out over 19 acres versus having to have each lot subdivided and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15634)|
| 4:20:40| platted and having potentially a greater impact with the RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15640)|
| 4:20:46| There is a housing issue in Knoxville. Two weeks ago at the last city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15646)|
| 4:20:53| the representative from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors talked about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15653)|
| 4:20:58| need for housing. And it wasn't just single-family or duplexes or townhomes. It was also multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15658)|
| 4:21:04| There's RN-5 zoning immediately adjacent to this. This is on a public transit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15664)|
| 4:21:11| We know from our traffic impact letter we submitted to city engineering that they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15671)|
| 4:21:19| require a traffic impact analysis, a full traffic impact analysis once we get to the permitting stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15679)|
| 4:21:25| And that may require, we know it's going to require at least dedication right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15685)|
| 4:21:29| at least 44 feet off of center. It may require additional traffic mitigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15689)|
| 4:21:34| such as a center lane or a turn lane. They talk about the pinch point where three lanes turn into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15694)|
| 4:21:39| two. That occurs along our frontage. And this is an opportunity when this is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15699)|
| 4:21:45| to address some of those issues. So I think RN-5 zoning makes the most sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15705)|
| 4:21:53| not just for the developer, but for the community and for the needs that we know we have in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15713)|
| 4:21:58| You know, usually when you have this type of neighborhood opposition, the votes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15718)|
| 4:22:02| planning commission are a little tighter. They're usually about 8-6. This one was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15722)|
| 4:22:08| overwhelming, 13-1. And, you know, we've really tried to reach out to the neighbors. We've listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15728)|
| 4:22:13| to their concerns. We've tried to address them as best we can. And we think this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15733)|
| 4:22:18| will address them. So we would ask that you support the planning commission's recommendation for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15738)|
| 4:22:25| RN-5 rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15745)|
| 4:22:30| Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15750)|
| 4:22:38| So I would like to ask Director Brooks, you know, back to planning commission did pass 13-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15758)|
| 4:22:46| on RN-5. And explain this planning staff and the planning commission's recommendations. Did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15766)|
| 4:22:54| something change? Or, you know, just from your perspective, can you help clarify some of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15774)|
| 4:23:02| Yes, Council Member, I can. So when this was originally presented to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15782)|
| 4:23:08| it was for the 39-plus acres that Mr. Mullins mentioned. And there was substantial discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15788)|
| 4:23:15| at planning commission about the back half of the property, the steepness of that portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15795)|
| 4:23:21| the property concern about grading and disturbance and those steep slopes. So at the request of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15801)|
| 4:23:28| planning commission, the applicant postponed and came back with a revised application for a smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15808)|
| 4:23:36| portion of the property. So they redrew their lines to about 21.98 acres. And that was in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15816)|
| 4:23:44| to keep that steepest portion of the site zoned agriculture. And so this would limit the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15824)|
| 4:23:50| of acres that they could disturb. And so that was, that's what changed. So there was substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15830)|
| 4:23:56| discussion at planning commission about whether or not to move forward with the RN-5. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15836)|
| 4:24:01| once they made that change, that's where the 13-to-1 vote comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15841)|
| 4:24:07| So does planning staff now recommend RN-5 with that modification? Or is your recommendation still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15847)|
| 4:24:15| RN-3? Planning commission, planning staff's recommendation to planning commission stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15855)|
| 4:24:20| the same for the RN-3. And the reason for that is, you know, both RN-3 and RN-4 are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15860)|
| 4:24:29| in the medium density. And they're very similar. So when you read the descriptions of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15869)|
| 4:24:34| and I think staff still recognize that there's, you know, still constraints associated with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15874)|
| 4:24:39| property. And, you know, the RN-3 is a new district that was introduced with the new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15879)|
| 4:24:46| code that provides additional opportunities for different types of housing, which also meet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15886)|
| 4:24:51| medium density housing requirement. So, you know, the intent was to still allow medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15891)|
| 4:25:00| residential. You know, staff and planning commission agree that this is a good location for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15900)|
| 4:25:05| medium density residential. It checks off all the boxes in terms of the location criteria. It's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15905)|
| 4:25:10| the transit line. It's in between two schools. There's sidewalks, commercial nearby. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15910)|
| 4:25:17| area is still, you know, predominantly RN-1, RN-2, with the exception of the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15917)|
| 4:25:23| multifamily developments that were mentioned along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15923)|
| 4:25:29| So I have a question. I'm just, so let's say that RN-5 gets denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15929)|
| 4:25:36| Could the developer then keep the CN on the front seven acres and build multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15936)|
| 4:25:43| and then on the back roughly 12 acres zone that RN-3? I mean, I'm just, I'm kind of just looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15943)|
| 4:25:55| at it from perspective of if they're going to have to look at alternatives if RN-5 doesn't pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15955)|
| 4:26:05| I mean, they could still do high density on the CN portion with multiunit, and then potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15965)|
| 4:26:14| I'm guessing, rezone that back half to RN-3, which would create substantial more density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15974)|
| 4:26:24| I would think, opposed to the proposed 250, 300 units, whatever, across 19 acres. I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15984)|
| 4:26:33| from a visual standpoint, I understand, but at the same time, I go back to, you know, RN-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=15993)|
| 4:26:46| being able to spread out. And I think as I understand and talk my conversation with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16006)|
| 4:26:51| Mullins, part of it was going to be designated, I think, for some community benefits, be it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16011)|
| 4:26:57| greenway or walking trail or something as part of the plan also. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16017)|
| 4:27:09| Okay. Council Member Thomas, and then we'll go to Roger. It's roughly about 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16029)|
| 4:27:15| and 20 acres of that is not developable. All right. The developer can't build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16035)|
| 4:27:24| He can't add density on it, because it's in the hillside protection plan. And it's also just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16044)|
| 4:27:33| prohibitive of developing it. So 20 acres of it is going to be a natural, no matter what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16053)|
| 4:27:40| developer wants to do. And I've been in discussions with Legacy Parks and Cheryl Eby with Parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16060)|
| 4:27:48| Recs. So the idea is to continue to collaborate with the developer and use this 20 acres that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16068)|
| 4:27:59| can't be developed anyway, just have a discussion if we can see that either turned over to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16079)|
| 4:28:08| or made accessible to the public, or be part of the, what I would prefer is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16088)|
| 4:28:20| RN3. And so you would still have that green space, but the developer can't develop on that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16100)|
| 4:28:28| So we're talking about 20, just 20 acres you can develop on. Right. I was just taking that 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16108)|
| 4:28:37| 20 acres, but the front seven right now, they could, with no rezoning, do multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16117)|
| 4:28:45| And then on that remaining 12 acres or 13 acres, my question was, can they still potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16125)|
| 4:28:54| rezone for RN3, which would create an exponential amount more density? I would think. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16134)|
| 4:29:03| I'm just trying to look at what they're trying. I go back to my comment that I've made in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16143)|
| 4:29:08| about when the developer is willing to work with the neighborhood and try to determine, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16148)|
| 4:29:13| that's a real gift. And then, you know, if they don't, potentially the consequences could be far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16153)|
| 4:29:21| worse. I think Mr. Millins has his hand raised. I'd like to hear from him again. Yes. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16161)|
| 4:29:27| Council Member Kessler. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16167)|
| 4:29:32| You're right. One of the differences in the dimensional and design standards for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16172)|
| 4:29:36| neighborhood commercial zone is the height. You know, if we were constrained to multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16176)|
| 4:29:41| development on those front seven acres, each building could go up to 45 feet tall, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16181)|
| 4:29:48| right there on the front of Merchant's Drive, whereas if we got the RN5 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16188)|
| 4:29:57| the height limitation for multifamily is reduced then to 35 feet. And, you know, if you've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16197)|
| 4:30:04| the property, and I do appreciate both, you know, Council Members Parker seeing it and Thomas coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16204)|
| 4:30:09| out of the property, when you walk back along that path and you get to the top of it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16209)|
| 4:30:14| that little open area, that little concrete pad, that is right at the back of those seven acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16214)|
| 4:30:21| And so there's still a lot of room back there where this multifamily development that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16221)|
| 4:30:25| talking about can be back away from the road, and the members of the community wouldn't even see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16225)|
| 4:30:33| you know, a large portion of it. Not that there wouldn't be some closer to the road as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16233)|
| 4:30:37| but it wouldn't be constrained to that seven acres and would be spread out. So it just makes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16237)|
| 4:30:42| a lot more flexible for development. It makes it a lot more flexible to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16242)|
| 4:30:47| the constraints of that property, which we all recognize because there is a lot of rock. It used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16247)|
| 4:30:51| to be a quarry mine, I believe the history tells us. There's a lot of topography there, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16251)|
| 4:30:57| a lot of existing vegetation that having 19 acres is spread out on would allow us to keep that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16257)|
| 4:31:02| respectfully, RN3 would require us to probably disturb more of it. You know, if we had rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16262)|
| 4:31:10| the entire portion of the property to RN3, which was staff's original recommendation, the area of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16270)|
| 4:31:16| disturbance that we would have been allowed at that point would have been 24.9 acres. It would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16276)|
| 4:31:20| have been substantially more. So by working with the community and drawing the line and limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16280)|
| 4:31:26| where we could develop, help preserve even more of the undeveloped part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16286)|
| 4:31:31| the agricultural part of the property, and that was out of result, listening to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16291)|
| 4:31:36| and listening to commission as to what they were concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16296)|
| 4:31:39| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16299)|
| 4:31:41| So, Mr. Mullins, briefly, if you don't get RN5, your client would prefer to keep the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16301)|
| 4:31:50| C in. Am I understanding that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16310)|
| 4:31:53| No, that's not what our preference would be. We would have to have a hard conversation between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16313)|
| 4:31:57| now and May 4th as to what we wanted to do with our options if the vote went that way tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16317)|
| 4:32:02| You know, and it may be that we would look at what we could do with RN3, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16322)|
| 4:32:07| from the preliminary conversations we've had in looking at that, that would require a lot more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16327)|
| 4:32:13| you know, density looking at closer to, you know, 300 duplexes or townhomes, or you can do up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16333)|
| 4:32:18| 170 single-family homes with the RN3 there. And that would be a lot more disturbance, but because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16338)|
| 4:32:25| of the economy of scale that we're dealing with, with construction costs, and the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16345)|
| 4:32:30| scale that we're dealing with, with construction costs being what they are, it would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16350)|
| 4:32:34| probably more of an investment, and that would be probably more areas disturbed than what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16354)|
| 4:32:39| could do with what our proposal has been all along with approximately 250 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16359)|
| 4:32:45| So, we may decide to move forward with the RN3 and do that. We may decide to get the RN3 and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16365)|
| 4:32:51| sell that to somebody else because that wasn't what the concept we had in mind when we purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16371)|
| 4:32:56| the property. Or we could withdraw our zoning and then look at coming back with some split zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16376)|
| 4:33:02| keeping the neighborhood commercial, and doing RN3, or just staying with it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16382)|
| 4:33:09| We were really wanting to see what this vote came out tonight, and if the RN5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16389)|
| 4:33:13| which is what the Planning Commission had recommended, would be something that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16393)|
| 4:33:18| body would support. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16398)|
| 4:33:25| Council Member Thomas. Yes. Everything that Mr. Mullins has said, I've been on these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16405)|
| 4:33:32| with the neighborhood and the developers, and Mr. Mullins has presented this to the neighborhood, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16412)|
| 4:33:39| he has some arguments that says that the RN5 would actually be better for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16419)|
| 4:33:48| than the RN3, but he's explained that to the neighborhood associations. You know, they live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16428)|
| 4:33:54| there. They've heard these arguments he's made, and they feel that what is in harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16434)|
| 4:34:01| with their neighborhood is a great compromise. It's RN3. It fits with their neighborhood. So, all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16441)|
| 4:34:08| the proposals that Mr. Mullins has made, and the, I guess, the assertions that RN5 would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16448)|
| 4:34:17| be better for them, they've heard that, and they have, I think, very reasonably, and I'm open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16457)|
| 4:34:26| the neighborhood association. You know, a lot of it's what they think would benefit their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16466)|
| 4:34:32| and they've heard all these arguments from the developer, and they still believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16472)|
| 4:34:36| for their neighborhood, RN3 is the best, and that's still the recommendation of the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16476)|
| 4:34:43| staff. So, I would continue to move and support a motion to amend to RN3, and you know, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16483)|
| 4:34:58| we can take it from there, but I think that's the proper zoning for this property at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16498)|
| 4:35:06| with the neighborhood that surrounds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16506)|
| 4:35:13| Mr. Thomas, is that a motion, or is that just a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16513)|
| 4:35:22| It's no, I'm making a motion to amend to RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16522)|
| 4:35:29| Okay, there's a motion to amend to RN3 made by Council Member Thomas. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16529)|
| 4:35:35| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16535)|
| 4:35:38| Okay, the motion to amend RN3 is made by Council Member Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16538)|
| 4:35:42| seconded by Council Member Smith. Any further, any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16542)|
| 4:35:49| Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=16549)|
