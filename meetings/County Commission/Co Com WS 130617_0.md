| 0:04:54| I am a member of the Knoxville Football Officials Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=294)|

| 0:06:49| I didn't know whether Phil or Mr. Ballard would like to be here and talk about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| I don't see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=415)|

| 0:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=430)|

| 0:07:16| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| We'll try to get Mr. Ballard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| So, Mr. Chairman, I saw Representative Haynes come in, and if we could, if he's still back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Representative Haynes, if you would come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| We had a discussion item two months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| and we're back now to hear his report with regards to term limits for the school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| It's already been reported, I think, in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| But, Representative Haynes, thank you so much for taking time to do this and being here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| and for the work that you have done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| And if you would like to tell us any report, anything you would like to report to us with regards to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| Yeah, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| And thank you for having me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| I'm presumed that all of you received my letters that I sent to you and also e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| And I had our legal staff research what processes we would have to take in order to term limit our school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| And as you all probably saw the response, and I'll just reiterate that, they came back and said that in order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| we would have to pass a law of general application, essentially, that would apply to every county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| rather than just specifically Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| And that, in my opinion, that presents a challenge in getting a piece of legislation like that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| I'm not sure that we would have the votes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| And then the second thing, it also referenced the Jordan decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Obviously, we have to, they were exempt from the term limits when we, when the commission was put under term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| And the final thing was that they did also say that, you know, we could try and do it for Knox and Shelby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| But once again, you have to have a rational basis in order to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| So I think it's kind of problematic to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| It's certainly something we can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| But one of the things I would keep the commission, ask you all to remember is that we're now put under a 15-bill limit in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| And it is difficult when we have limited bill spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| We certainly want to use them on something that's productive and something we think we can pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| So I would encourage you all to consider that if you do pass a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| At this time, it just doesn't seem very feasible to me to proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| And if you all have any questions, I'll be happy to entertain those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Thank you, Mr. Haynes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| We probably will just wait for the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| I don't see any on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| It seems like your explanation has some weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Since I was the originator of that resolution, I will make a motion that we're going to put it in abeyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=584)|
| 0:10:01| I want to just put it in abeyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| Mr. Law Director, what's the proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| You can table it and take two-thirds to bring it back at some future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| Or you can withdraw it and bring it back later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| Withdraw the resolution we already passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Oh, did you pass the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Oh, yeah, that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| It's just sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Well, to negate that or to put it in abeyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| I think your resolution was to ask the state representative to do the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| So I think we just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| I just don't want to leave anything hanging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| It's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| And Representative Haynes is here to report on what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| What you would have to do now is make another request to the state to either go or no go or do nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| or not make a request, do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| I mean, that's up to this body now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| As Representative Haynes just said, just kind of let him know if you want him to do something, let him know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Otherwise, he's on hold and plans to take no actions, my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| At this point, I don't plan to take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Any comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Me personally, I just think those are sort of lame excuses for what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| I think you're trying to skirt around the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| I think it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| The 15 limit on the bills, that can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| But, I mean, it's very obvious that the voters in Knox County wants term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| I'm not giving my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| I gave my legal department's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| I mean, I know you all have an attorney here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| These are not my opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| This is what my lawyers drew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| And I researched the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| I'm simply reporting back what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| And I don't know how much push from the state we're going to get because that, you know, Ryan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| you're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| You're a first-class state representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| But I think this bill, when it goes to Nashville, it brings light to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Oh, we're term limited too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| And if we start talking term limits, all these different things, they might want to term limit us as state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| and state senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| So that's something that we're running into on our end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| But I think people here in Knox County really want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Any other questions for Representative Haynes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you again for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| You all are a lot easier than the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Thanks, Cassidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Thanks, Mr. Haynes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| The next item is item number 48 on page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| It's Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| It's designating, committing, and appropriating surplus funds in the amount of $500,000 from fiscal year 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| to fiscal year 2014 for the Community Action Committee, CAC, Mobile Mills Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| This is a one-time appropriation from fiscal year 13 surplus funds to fiscal year 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=772)|
| 0:13:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| I have a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Do you want to see it first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Oh, and Jolie got it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| This is just a snapshot of kind of where we are with Mobile Mills right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| and especially in terms of the aging population in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| And I gave you each a copy of this, too, so you can look at it while we're flipping through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| On this first page, it shows that Knoxville's population is aging, which we all know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| You've heard it from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| You've heard it from Barbara Monte, who unfortunately is no longer with us, Barbara Kelly at CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=825)|
| 0:13:53| This is something that we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| On the next page, it shows specifically where the baby boomers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| And we're on just the forward edge of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| As we continue to move through time, the number of people reaching 65 and over is going to continue to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| And then we've got the echo boomers who are going to be coming along pretty soon after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| So the need for another, apparently, mini boom is expected to begin soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| So, as you can see, our need for senior services is going to continue to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| On the next page, you can see where our population specifically is aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| There's a sizable increase in the median age from 1960 to 2011, from 29 to 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| What's really interesting is if you look at 18 to 64 years in 1960 Knox County, especially that 65 years and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=889)|
| 0:15:00| that's jumped from 8% to 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| And that's what we're seeing with increased medical care, better medical care, better preventative care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=904)|
| 0:15:14| Our seniors are not only making it to 65, they're making it far beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| So we have a lot of seniors who are aging in place, which is what we want to encourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| because that is the least expensive place for seniors to age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| It usually keeps them happier and healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| But we're going to be having more and more seniors hitting that age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| The next page, which you can't see it very well on the screen, but you can see it in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| is that if you look at Table 2, look at the percentage and growth, especially from 80 to 84 and 85 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=952)|
| 0:16:06| Look at that just from 2010 to 2025 and that 85 plus, how much that's expected to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=966)|
| 0:16:14| That's almost an 80% growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| So our senior services are going to be in greater demand, not just for those who are over age 65,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| but especially for those who are 75 and older and those who reach 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| And we're going to be having more and more people reaching the age of 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| On this next page, it gives you some facts about hunger in the elderly in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| We have more than 80,000 seniors, and the population, as we just said, has grown 34% in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| Mobile Meals Program serves hot noon meals five days a week to residents who are 60 years old at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| and cannot cook for themselves or have no one to prepare meals for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| We currently provide meals to over 900 homebound seniors, and that's in every zip code in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| Sixty-seven meal routes, 60 are covered by volunteers and 70 or seven are delivered by paid staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| And they also deliver hot meals on Thanksgiving and Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| What we run into trouble with this year, and we knew this starting back in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| is that we are losing funding for Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| And because of insufficient funding, we've got a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| When this was written, it was almost 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| Now it's well over 100 individuals who are on the waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| CAC Mobile Meals does a great job with the funding that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| They are very cost effective and provide a great service for very, very low costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| But still, it costs something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| So when we got here, who receives Mobile Meals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| There is a misperception that Mobile Meals is for low-income seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1078)|
| 0:18:07| Mobile Meals is for any senior over the age of 60 who can't cook for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| and has no one to provide meals for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| More than 60 percent of them are over 75 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Many are in their 80s and 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Most of them live alone, and there's no one to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| And income is not a factor in deciding who receives Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Each person who receives a meal is asked to contribute towards the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| with the suggested contribution based on income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| And this gives you a breakdown of how the meals are funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| A little over half are provided through federal and state grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| and local funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| And additional meals have been provided in the past through United Way, individuals, churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| businesses, and foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| And, of course, our volunteers are a crucial resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| I don't know how many of you have ever delivered Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I think quite a few of you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| It's a very rewarding and enriching experience, and the volunteers are crucial to the success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| Now, these last few pages, these are 98 of the people on the waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| And some of them I want to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Mr. and Mrs. S, ages 92 and 89, are both frail and in poor health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| Mr. S has mid-stage dementia and recently wandered outside and was found lying in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| Mrs. S has macular degeneration resulting in poor vision as well as being hard of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| She is very anxious about her husband and worries about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Then another one, Ms. M, age 60, lives alone on a very low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| She has a history of stroke resulting in short-term memory loss and speech difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| She also has breathing problems, weakness in her legs, and cannot stand long enough to cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| She recently fell, breaking her arm, which has made it even more difficult for her to prepare meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| Mr. S, age 70, lives alone and is a veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| He was recently widowed and said his wife always did all the cooking and he has no idea how to prepare meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| He lives on sandwiches and snack foods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| He has high blood pressure, arthritis, and had a stroke, which left weaknesses in his right arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| So if you can manage to read through these pages, these are all stories of people who desperately need someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1225)|
| 0:20:40| who looks in on them every day, which is another thing that mobile meal volunteers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| They not only deliver the meal, they check in on the person that they're delivering it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| But they need this nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Unfortunately, since the waiting list started, some people on this list have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| Now, I'm not going to say that they died because they didn't receive mobile meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| but if you're in one of these situations, how long do you think you're going to last if you don't get proper nutrition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| So this is basically what mobile meals is and why we need this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| Now, what this funding is going to do, this is a one-time request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| This is not something that's going to come up year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| This is a one-time funding request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| What it will do is get these people off what Chris Caldwell has managed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| is figure out a way that even though we don't have the surplus funds until September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| that we can start utilizing this July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| What it will do immediately is take every one of these people off this waiting list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| and get them the nutrition, the hot lunches that they need every day with somebody checking in on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| That's the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| What it will also do is catch up where the funding is falling short for the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| to give them a little breathing room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| And it also provides funds to let Mobile Meals hire a consultant who can help them develop a sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| long-term fundraising plan, which is what they've been lacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| and one of the reasons that funding is falling short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| So this is a one-time thing, a stopgap measure to catch them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| giving them some breathing space and some time to develop a long-term strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| so that this never happens to Knox County seniors again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| I'd like to remind you that the majority of these seniors probably have lived in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| and paid taxes for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| The tax dollars that they've paid into our system have paid for the schools that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| and your children have attended, the roads that we drive on every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| This is not --these are not poor people looking for a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| These are our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| And I know that in the past there has been a Mobile Meals fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| It raised, I think, $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I know that Michael Greider has been working on putting one together for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| and we hope that it will be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| But even if it's as successful as the last one, it's still not going to do what it needs to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| to keep Mobile Meals solvent for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| And also, when you read these stories, it's really hard to think, yes, I know you're hungry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| but if you just hang on for another month, we're going to have a fundraiser for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| I have a really hard time telling our seniors that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| So that's my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| Anybody's got any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| I think there's some people here also from Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| And is there any --I think there were some people, volunteers, who wanted to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| I don't know if they were able to be here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| We were actually expecting this to come up much, much later in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Well, thank you, Amy, for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| I'm sure there's going to be several questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| So why don't we just proceed with that process right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| and if somebody comes and wants to speak or can help in the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| we'll certainly entertain that as they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| So why don't we go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Mr. Anders, go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Yeah, I don't disagree with anything that Amy says about the seniors and about where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| But I do remember the --I think it was in 2008, 2009, they did the fundraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| and caught everybody up on the waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| And that kind of sustained them, and now the feds have pulled back some funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| But I think it would be more wise for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| instead of just appropriating $500,000 without a plan, other than to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| And she's already set me up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| But to wait on the telethon and then see where we're at come August or September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| and then help them develop a sustainable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| And I think so I guess my reason for speaking would be to substitute motion to do let the telethon see where it falls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1504)|
| 0:25:14| and then also continue this discussion until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| So that would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Well, we've got to entertain the motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| So we have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| So we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| To postpone this action until the telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Let me go ahead with some other lights and I'll come back to you, Ms. Broils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| I'll yield to Commissioner Broils and let her respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| I'm sure she's going to want to respond to some things I have to say, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Go ahead, Ms. Broils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Again, Mike and Brad, would you like to call these seniors and tell them, I know you're hungry and frail and weak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1549)|
| 0:25:58| and if you just hang on another month, we're going to raise you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Frankly, I also have a, you know, I know that when we did this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| the entire staff, administrative staff, worked on this for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| And it was a huge undertaking and they only raised $170-something thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| We've known about this since January, and quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| nothing's gotten moving on this until just recently to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| I don't think it's likely that this is going to raise the kind of money that it raised previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| I can also tell you that, and this is, I worked hard with Chris Caldwell to figure out a way that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| of course, it would be best to wait until the surplus actually comes in and then, but these people can't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| I feel bad even asking them to wait until July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| They cannot wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| As I said, some of them have already died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| I think that asking them to wait until after the telethon is doing a huge disservice to our senior citizens in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| And I'll also say that having talked with CAC Mobile Meal staff, with Barbara Kelly at CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1629)|
| 0:27:17| that they have agreed that whatever money is raised from the telethon can be deducted from this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| And whatever money they don't use through the end of the year is going to be turned back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| So chances are they're not even going to use the full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| So I think we should have the telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Let's raise as much money as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| And then, as I said, they've agreed to have that amount deducted because we anticipated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| to have this amount deducted from this that's been appropriated to go back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| So, please, let's not make these seniors wait another month to get the nutrition that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1671)|
| 0:27:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you, Ms. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Let me begin my remarks by saying that I've been involved with Mobile Meals, and they used to be Mobile Meals and Golden Diners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| I have delivered Mobile Meals, have been involved in fundraisers, have gone to the homes and visited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| I'm very well aware of the need and the great work that they do on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| I do have two or three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Question number one would come from Michael Greider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| If you wouldn't mind coming to the podium, Mr. Greider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1705)|
| 0:28:34| Michael Greider, 400 Main Street, Suite 615.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| I know that I've been in conversations with you about the, I guess, the telethon, radiothon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| the fundraiser that you're putting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| We did this about four years ago, maybe three, four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| In 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| If I remember well, when we had our initial meeting, we brought in members of the news media, the television, the radio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| the newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Everybody got on board with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| And we had thought that we might raise $75,000, and I think we ended up with, what, $170,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| $170,000 sounds right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| When the need was presented to the community, the community responded in a great way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| And so we were just all surprised and delighted with the response that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| And I know that our company is behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| We're going to be helping you in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| I know all the other companies are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| So what is your timetable for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Right now we're looking at July 29th as the date of the telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| We've touched base with all three of the TV stations in town as well as several of the radio broadcast clusters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| There are a couple of the locally owned stations that we still have to reach out to to get their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| But we're in a position now where we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| We started moving on phone lines today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| We're going to need about 20 phone lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| We can get those fairly easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| All the broadcast outlets have committed their time and resources on the air to making this happen all day on Monday, July 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1785)|
| 0:29:55| So there's immediate buy-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| The initial meeting that we had at CAC Mobile Meals was very positive and very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| So I think, you know, there's a good shot that this is going to be a successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| I don't want to oversell it, but I think there's a good shot that this will be a very successful telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Secondly, Mr. Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1813)|
| 0:30:27| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Let's talk about a plan that you've worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Can you tell us what that plan is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| There's three ways to do money for CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| And as I talked to Commissioner Buols, I just laid out the three plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Plan one was to amend the current budget that we're in currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| and appropriate $500,000 from fund balance and do that for and give it as a donation to CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| which I said I would oppose because any time you amend a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| then our rating agencies do not look positively on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| So I said you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Option two at the time was to amend the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| This was prior to its passage on May 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| So that was option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| And option three is through a designation or commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| Now, myself, I never bring designations to the county commission until after the fiscal year is complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| and we're closing out our books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| We know there's going to be a surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| So schools brought theirs in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| So I said you could bring it in the form of a designation this month in which July 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| we could go ahead and do the appropriation once we roll the new budget in and open the new fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| So it's no different than what we would do in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| It's just moving it up a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| So how much is a monthly appropriation for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| If we were to break it down per month, how much would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| $6,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| No, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| I'm doing math in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| It's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Do you know what the carryover from this month until August would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| I mean, what the monthly stopping is for CAC from the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Barbara Kelly is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Oh, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Do you have an answer for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| She didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Ms. Kelly, you want to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Can I answer something that Mike mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| About having the telethon, which I'm a full supporter of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| But even if it raises enough to get these people off this waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| the waiting list is going to start again because the funding is continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and continuing and continuing to drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| And the need, as people age, even this next year, it's expected to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| Percentage every year it's going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So the funding is going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| The need is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| The telethon is going to get these people off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| but it's not going to do anything towards the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| I mean, you know, within two months we're going to have a waiting list again, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| And, Brad, part of my plan for this was that part of this money is going to go towards developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| that long-range sustainable fundraising plan so that Mobile Meals doesn't have to come to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| and ask for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| They can be completely self-sustaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| That's worked into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| That's the ultimate goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| But we have to give them the time and the breathing space to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Ms. Kelly, would you come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| And there was a question about the monthly contribution of the county to CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2042)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| This year that's proposed, you know, we're starting in July, is 1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| So the county contributes 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| 1.6, including our capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Is that just for Mobile Meals or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Yeah, could you break down Mobile Meals for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| That's for everything that CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| For all CAC, all of our contribution to CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| A portion of that 1.6 is for, is given to Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Part of that goes to repaying the bond on the Mobile Meals kitchen, which is 168,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| And then I'll have to check and see exactly how much goes to Mobile Meals of the county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| I can check that in just a minute for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Is it my understanding that the request that CAC made to the county was fully funded this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2108)|
| 0:35:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| And I really would like to make that abundantly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| You know, in the spring, you know, we make our budget requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| And we did request our last year's funding was 1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| And this year we asked for an additional $50,000 to go towards some salary increases for CAC employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2134)|
| 0:35:42| And that total amount was funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| We didn't ask for any specific increases for any particular program, including Mobile Meals at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2145)|
| 0:35:57| So Mobile Meals, about half of Mobile Meals, is funded through federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| And that takes about half of the meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| The other half is, and there are many communities all across the country where those are the only meals that are provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| You know, the amount that the federal government spends is the amount that we have for Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| In our community, we have, through fundraising, through, you know, private support, we have just about double that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2179)|
| 0:36:30| So we provide about half of the meals that we provide each day are provided by the federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| and about half are provided by the funds that are raised each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Did you anticipate the loss of federal funds in the devising of your budget this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| We didn't anticipate the sequester, and we actually have not received a cut due to the sequester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| What we had hoped and what we were planning was our local fundraising has not really lived up to what it has lived up in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2215)|
| 0:37:06| We had some foundations that we depended upon for some very large annual gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| And since 2008, those gifts have been reduced, and one of the foundations actually is even no longer in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2233)|
| 0:37:25| So it isn't so much a reduction on the governmental side as it's a reduction on the private side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2245)|
| 0:37:33| And one of the things that we're just going to have to do a better job on is on the local fundraising side of the equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2253)|
| 0:37:44| because we are not going to be able to rely purely on federal government funding at a time when that's being cut back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2264)|
| 0:37:56| when here in Knox County we are seeing an increase in the population of people over age 65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2276)|
| 0:38:05| and a significant increase in the population of people 75 and above who require in-home services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2285)|
| 0:38:14| But that's a big, you know, that's an awful lot of money to include in our annual budget request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2294)|
| 0:38:24| And so we were hoping that we would be able to increase our private funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| And we do have a mailing out now, and we are trying to look at other ways of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| But we've had a number of just unforeseen things that have come up this year that we've been trying to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| And it's just we just haven't really gotten to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| So I hope that's an explanation of where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| But I do want to make clear, just abundantly clear, that our budget request was funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| and the repairs were made to the Mobile Meals Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| And we actually, as an agency, could not begin to do the things that we do in this community without the support of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2347)|
| 0:39:20| And I just wanted to make sure that that was really, really clearly understood by, not only by each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2360)|
| 0:39:29| but by the public in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you, Ms. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| We've got several lights on, so just hang around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| They're going to be asking you questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| But thank you for explaining that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| There is sometimes maybe an assumption that we're being a little bit tight in terms of how we're treating CAC and your programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2382)|
| 0:39:55| And I think that with a broad understanding of budget, that helps us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| and helps us to see the larger picture financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| That's what we've got to be concerned with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Let me let these other guys go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| I guess where I was going with all of this is what you have talked about, Ms. Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2412)|
| 0:40:21| is that the need to get local funds and local fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| And I think that this is the attempt with the telethon, radiothon, fundraiser, July the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| is to you're going to be hitting all mediums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| And so it's going to be an opportunity to present to the public the fact that this need exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| And I feel very strongly that they're going to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| How much money do you need to operate for 30 days to get these extra meals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| If you were to say, okay, we've got folks who are hungry right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| and I need some dollars for 30 days while we do this telethon, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| And let me also put a caveat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| There is no way, no way, and I'm being very respectful when I say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| that I'm going to vote for $100,000 for a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Now, I will take a look at voting to feed people and to feed hungry people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| but to pay a consultant, I have a lot of heartburn with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| So maybe we can talk about that and maybe you can convince me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| but I'm not convinced that we need to pay a consultant $100,000 to come in to give us advice on how to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| So I think we've got expertise in the community that can help you with that, maybe for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| But I guess my question is, is how much over a 30-day period do you think you would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| to provide the food for mobile meals, just for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| The excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| The excess, not the total, just the excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| I think he's referring to the waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| I'm referring to the waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| In other words, you've got the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| You've got the basic money for the mobile meals program, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| And what we're looking for are people that are not being serviced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| So I'm saying to service those people for one month, what would the additional cost be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| Well, we were talking about 100 people on the waiting list now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| It's 113 as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| 113 as of today at $820 per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| That's per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Divided by 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Just, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| So 820 divided by 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| I hate to do math in public, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| I'm not real good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| But, no, you, I can figure this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| That was what I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I think for Monday's discussion, for next Monday, I would like to have, I guess we could figure it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| what would cancel the waiting list for a month or two and then see where we get with the telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| I guess that's kind of what Mr. Chairman Hammond or Mr. Hammond had in mind was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| So are you changing your motion then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| No, I'm asking for information that I'd like to have for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Because my motion will stay the same, but it can change between now and next Monday based on the information we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| So what, Mike, what you're asking for is how much it's going to cost to take 113 people off the waiting list for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2595)|
| 0:43:25| Yeah, 30 or 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| I'm going to do 30 days and then 60 days because I really believe that this telethon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| exactly what you've said is we need to let people know about the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| And I think this is going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| And so I'm just wanting to know what the figures would be for 30 days or maybe 60 days while we can take a look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| and then maybe go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Well, since the telethon is not going to be until the 29th of July, how about we do 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| It will, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| That's why I say we can look at 30 or 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| I'd like to get figures for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Now, what about the people who would wind up on the waiting list in the meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Do you want to instead of saying 113, do you want to say like 125?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| No, let's take the need we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| I mean, we can speculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| I mean, but I would like to go with the need we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah, you know, again, trying not to do math in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| It looks like it's about $8,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| I'm showing $7,721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| I rounded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| I rounded up to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| And that may deal with some of these people that may come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| So roughly speaking, about $8,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Eight thousand a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Several comments that have been brought out here I'd like to question, reemphasize, or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| Mr. Broll says you've known since January how bad this problem was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| But yet our budget passed with no push to get this increased before it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2689)|
| 0:44:58| The budget that the CAC requested was fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| There hasn't been any federal cuts yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| This could have been amended prior to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| So why are we waiting until after the fact to do it like we did last year with the buses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| I mean, this seems to be a repetitious thing, and we're going to have to find a project this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| Now, I'm not trying to downgrade those that need the mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| But from what I'm hearing right here right now, it's a case of maybe a little poor planning in getting this stuff together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2726)|
| 0:45:40| So, you know, I can't support this no way the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| I could maybe do this month or two-months deal, but struggling, I don't know, $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2745)|
| 0:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| You know, I'm supportive of some support, so I'll say that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| But that's not really why I want to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| You know, the issues that I see that I like are, first and foremost, to me, and I'm currently a caregiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2770)|
| 0:46:22| the most important thing is laying eyes on these people on five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| To me, that's more important than the meal when you're dealing with people with some of these conditions that are described here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| And they're typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| And I talked to the Dr. Buchanan at one point talking about, you know, my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2801)|
| 0:46:49| He said, oh, yeah, she described all the things that he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| How did you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| You know, seven, eight years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| So there are some commonalities between, you know, within the aging population that we're just going to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| And laying eyes on these people as the volunteers come forward and deliver these meals to me is even more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2822)|
| 0:47:11| than the actual substance that they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| So, you know, I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| And I like the fact that we will be doing that for whatever period of time to these additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| The other piece, and while I don't want to argue numbers, and I don't disagree with Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| and $100,000 is a lot, but we have to realize this whole funding dynamic has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| I mean, the time that I've sat here, you know, you look at what went out to community grants in 2008 to what's going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| It's orders of magnitude lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| When you look at federal dollars and, like you say, these foundations that just went poof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| or just giving you 10 percent of what they used to give you or 50 percent, it's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| So I'm not saying, no, government steps up in that absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| But these dollars, we need to put some money into showing them, helping them to figure out how not to come back next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| So, you know, $100,000, yeah, that's too much, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| But we're going to have to have some people smarter than us come in and tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| how can we raise funds for these worthy causes in this changing environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| I mean, people are really keeping up with how we can make the ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| You know, telethons were big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| They're not as big anymore as they were 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| So I'm hopeful that this telethon will kick off and maybe they'll consider it new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| But we do need to spend some money in training these folks at CAC on how they can make a better ask, a more effective ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2924)|
| 0:48:53| How can we get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Maybe it's not, you know, five foundations that it's been all over the past, but it's 20 foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| But we're going to have to help them help themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| So I do want to give some monies to a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| Again, we can argue over the dollar amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| But I do think we need a long-range plan for how not to let this happen so they won't be coming back each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| Because the numbers are the numbers, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| I'm hoping and praying that I get to be a senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| That's my goal, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| I want to be on this side of the dirt as long as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| And these folks that want to as well want to continue to live a quality life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| And then the other thing, and it may or may not happen, so it's sounding like the mood of the room is something more temporary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| which I'm fine with, I'm fine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| But, you know, if we were going to give a dollar amount, I did like the fact that whatever the telethon raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| that we would deduct that amount from whatever we gave them up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| So I'm all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I don't want them to get, say we give them $300,000, they get $170,000, they get a total of $470,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| I was never in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| So I did like hearing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| So, you know, again, just trying to share some of my thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| But, Commissioner Adams, I don't know, what's the motion on the floor at the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| Well, the motion right now, the substitute motion is to, I guess, really to postpone this until after the telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3017)|
| 0:50:27| And then I'd like to have, I mean, because really, and then come back into discussion with August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| I mean, to kind of talk about it when we do normal budget adjustments at the end with the leftovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3033)|
| 0:50:41| But what I'd really, I mean, CAC has got such a huge board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| and there's, I mean, I'm one of the local nonprofits that's struggling too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| And I think that, you know, we're changing our dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| And I think, you know, this really, and I'm not being critical of anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| but this dynamic hasn't, this dynamic has been changing for two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| And the board's really not adjusted to that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| And so I think it's important to kind of look at the makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| And, you know, some of the questions I'd like to talk to Amy about, I may try to do that this week, is the fundraising issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| And so, you know, my substitute motion is to let the telethon, let the people, let the churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3080)|
| 0:51:28| and the people know about it, the businesses know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| And see what their step up is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| And then let's have a discussion about ongoing and sustainability in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| You know, I'm not against that at face value, but I would like to do something in this interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| something in this interim until we get those dollars in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| So that 30, 60, something like 60 days is something that I will be supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| And that's why I want the information for Monday, what it would cost us for two months or three months or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| But this problem hasn't changed since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| You're out of order, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| You can't just start talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| I'll stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| So I guess my question would be, Commissioner Adams, would it be more appropriate just to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| without recommendation and we have a discussion on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Yes, I can change that to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| I didn't want to go back to the original motion, but I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| I can change my motion to without recommendation and try to get the numbers for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Who is the second to the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| Is that okay with you, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| No recommendation for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Do I get to wrap up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Well, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Well, I wanted to say, Brad, we do need to sit down and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| I actually just got appointed to the CAC board, and I've been going to meetings now for a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| and I agree that things are changing and that the board is going to need to make some adjustments, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| So we've definitely got that underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| And I'm, like I said, CAC is not asking for an unlimited amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| They're not going to go on a spending spree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| This was simply to make sure that none of our seniors fall through the cracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| while they're working on this long-range goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| I can also tell you that the $100,000 for the consultant, that was not a number that I picked out or put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| That, I'm not sure where that, who put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| But I had wanted some money for some consulting to help them develop a long-term plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| But $100,000 was not what I had in mind for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| I can also say that, yes, we've known about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| So has, and I hate to put you on the spot, Michael, but so has Michael Greider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| And I'd asked to be put on the loop on this from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| and the last e-mail that I got about what they were trying to do was dated in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| So we've all been working hard on this since January to put this together and deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| No one has forgotten about this or didn't include it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| As Chris pointed out, he and I had a conversation about the best way to accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| He didn't think it was a good idea to try to amend the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| that he thought it was better to try to get it out of the surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| So I have consulted with Michael Greider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| I've consulted with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| I've talked to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| We have all been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| We've all been aware of the problem and working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Nobody is just popping up now and saying, oh, this is an issue, please fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| So I think this is something that we're all committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| If I can speak for Michael, he's working his tail off on this now and trying to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Hold on, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| She still has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Ms. Royals, I think this is going in a favorable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| Oh, I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| I'm perfectly fine with just funding to keep the people off of it for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| I think it is going in a favorable way for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| I just want to interject that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| But I just wanted to make sure that you all understand that whatever is, you know, this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| if we get these people off the waiting list with the funding from the telethon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| the funding is still going down while the need is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| So there's still going to be something to talk about when we do get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| And this also is great because this will make Chris happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| It will give us some breathing room between now and when we have the total amount of the surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| So, but that's we're going to have this conversation again when that comes in because this is not going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| even with a great telethon and a couple of months reprieve for us to provide for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| it's still an issue that we need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Mr. Grider, you wanted to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Commissioners, I just wanted to clarify that this isn't an issue that's been laying fallow since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Commissioner Broyles and Chris Caldwell, after a CAC board meeting back in February, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| did mention that a telethon was brought up as a possibility during that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| and reached out to Commissioner Broyles to try to schedule a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Unfortunately, she wasn't able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| But we did meet with Barbara Monte, Barbara Kelly, several members of the mayor's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| including Jennifer Lingenfelter, who's helping organize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Chris Caldwell was in that meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| So at that point in February, we decided that, you know, we were up against the budget season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| We need to, and it wasn't something that CAC was really in a position at this exact moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| from what I can remember, to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| We didn't have the resources at that time to put into putting together a successful telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| And so we all agreed at that time to hold off until after the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| At no point was it something that was ever just laid by the wayside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| As soon as the budget, in fact, before the budget was even voted on, we had already taken it back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| and we're trying to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| So just to let, make sure that everybody's aware that it's not something that we just let go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Thank you, Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Thank you, Mr. Grutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| In looking at these numbers, again, I want to make sure that I'm totally correct here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| It's $820 a year per person to feed them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| Divide that by 12, and that is, what, per person, what, $68.33 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3436)|
| 0:57:27| Now, the $820 a year, if you multiply that out, that doesn't come up to $392,780.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| It's less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| I mean, that's so I don't want to do math in public now, but what I do want to do is let's look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| and let's really look at it very, you know, with our pencils and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| and let's really look at it because when you look at the 113 people times the $820 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| it's a lot less than $392,780.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| And so, anyway, I just want to mention that maybe we can do that during the chairman's lunch or something, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| or however you decide to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| But I think that we need to really take a look at these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| I can answer that after the meeting, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| The motion before us is to send on with our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| So we'll have some numbers on Monday to help us with this, what to do in the next 30 to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3504)|
| 0:58:33| The next item is on page 14, item number 53, resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| It's requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission, MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| to recommend amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance to remove distance regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| for the sale of beer from the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| You asked for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Do you want to tie that to the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| Those are in the ordinance section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| One or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| So you're taking it out on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Mr. Law Director, do you see the need to follow some other process here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| It would be fine either way, whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| You've got it would depend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| It sounds like when we do this, though, that we're just taking it out all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| It will depend on whether you approve the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Well, we're going to go ahead with the other one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| They'll both be in position either way today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Let's just do it one at a time and we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| I don't have a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Mike, did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| Mr. Brown, did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Will you make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| And Mr. Smith seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Yeah, I think, you know, we talked about this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| And I think the law director met with some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| And I'd just like an explanation of what the meeting and where we're at with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| I think it's been recrafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| Where are we at with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Tell us the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| We met with all the interested parties here, Commissioner Anders, over the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| And there was quite a few, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| And basically, we crafted it around the old ordinance and zoning and moved it under the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3621)|
| 1:00:32| And we identified the method of measurement to be in compliance with the state statutes as it relates from residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3632)|
| 1:00:41| to residence to the zone to zone from building to building and point of service to buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| Everyone in and we narrowed it down to on premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| And everyone present was, how's the word, very happy when they left and that there were no issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3657)|
| 1:01:06| As a matter of fact, if Mr. Seymour is here today, he was representing some of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| And I'd like for him to either comment or add there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| I'm giving you my perception of their point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Mr. Seymour, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| Yes, we had a meeting last week with Law Director Armstrong, Mr. Buick, and several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3685)|
| 1:01:35| Representatives were there from Food City, Kroger's, Weigel's, Pilot, Walgreens, Easy Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3695)|
| 1:01:44| Who am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Yeah, Cherokee Distributing, Eagle Distributing also, both the major beer distributors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| and went over the new proposal with Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| And when we left, everybody was very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| It kept the status quo on off-premise sales of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| So that will remain the same as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| So I would concur with Mr. Armstrong, all the interested parties, and there were quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| We filled the commission conference room upstairs, standing room only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| And everybody was happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| And so I guess the other question goes back to when we take it out of zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| and we put it in ordinances, essentially what we're doing, we're removing the ability to do variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| And so if we have, again, if we have a, let's just say that a North Shore Town Center pops up somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| around Choteau and Duncan, or out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| And, you know, North Shore Town Center currently has a beer, a pizza place, Cassie's Sports Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3769)|
| 1:03:00| It will probably get more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Under this new ordinance, not zoning ordinance, that would not be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| Because there's a park there and a school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| Under the current ordinance, it's not really possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| You're going through the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| We have a lot of legal issues with variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| That's the whole issue at hand because you have a due process issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| and treating everybody the same way fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| And this is a regulation where the other is land use under zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| Everywhere else it should have been under the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| And once it's under a regulation, there will be no variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| And if you're going to do planning for those type of businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| you take that into effect before you start land purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| So the answer to your question is if it was in conflict with this regulation, then it would not be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3831)|
| 1:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| Oh, Mr. Seymour, you have something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| If I may add one thing in support of what Mr. Armstrong said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| I think on the residential distance requirement the resident has to formally object to the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3861)|
| 1:04:31| And one thing I didn't see on the online one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| but I think I saw on the one you all gave me the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| is if you have a state ABC license, the distance requirement goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3876)|
| 1:04:44| That's correct, and it's in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| Page 15, item number 56, ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 10, Sections 2-768 and 2-828| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3905)|

| 1:05:37| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| All this is doing is updating our ordinance to reflect federal law, what the state is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| and what the city passed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| So it's all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=3963)|

| 1:07:55| And I just want to make one comment towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| I haven't heard anything from the vendors, so to speak, that this is going to be an undue hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| So I'm hoping it won't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4084)|

| 1:08:46| All in favor say oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we send this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| I'm going to ask that we take a look at the pricing unless I think the pricing would change the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4131)|
| 1:08:59| Mr. Law Director, or would it be enough of a change to where it would affect it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Because I really feel like, and I have it as a discussion item today, but I'm going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4143)|

| 1:09:11| I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| I'm just looking at the price that's being paid for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| Mr. Hammond, the pricing issue would be affecting another part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4156)|
| 1:09:26| This ordinance would exclude charitable organizations from the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| whatever the price you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| So we can go ahead and pass this so it's not a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| And your discussion would really bring another change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4181)|

| 1:11:52| Item 67, discussion regarding additional fiscal information to be provided in the caption of resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Mr. Smith, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Let me just jump on this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| This is something that I asked for a year or two years ago and asking, I guess, our office to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| Joe Lee and the girls up there to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| But, in all honesty, that's not fair to Joe Lee because she doesn't know what our budget is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| and doesn't want to spend the time going through and doing the research there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| So I've checked with the mayor's office and Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| What I want to do is, as we have these items that come up, just list whether it was budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| or is it passed through money or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| That way we know if somebody is trying to add extra to us from what we've already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| And people that come up here and pick up these and the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| they'll know immediately whether this is something that was previously budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| So if we don't spend a lot of time on something, then we know that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| that we may have already been talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| It's already been in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| But just a little housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| And Chris Caldwell thought he had no problem with it whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| And the mayor's office was on board with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| I'm sure Ms. Caldwell can accommodate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Chris, you need to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Is there any problem there, Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Next item was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| It's discussion of the joint education committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| Mr. McKenzie, would you like to start us out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| And I'll ask Commissioner Wright if he'd like to chime in because I know there will definitely be gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| But we met last week and we spent most of the meeting discussing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| And we ended up electing, appointing co-chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4414)|
| 1:13:42| There's not going to be a chair person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| Karen Carson and I will serve as co-chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| Again, we talked a lot about, you know, how we approach issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| and how we deal with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| We do have a facilitator that's been, you know, independently paid to help us through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| what we think are going to be some media issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| And at the end of the day, we don't vote on anything that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| We're a discussion group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| So that was abundantly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| But, you know, we do want those media issues to come our way and, you know, try not to blindside each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| I think that was the biggest push in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| An executive summary will be sent out by our facilitator after we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| And it will be sent to the Education Committee with both larger organizations copied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| So the Board of Education and the County Commission will be copied on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| The costs associated with the public notice will be shared as well as the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| the setting up of rooms and whatnot will be shared between the school board and the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| Our next meeting will be July the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| We've said we will meet from 430 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| All are welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| So we're generally going to meet the first Thursday of each month, but that happened to fall on the 4th this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| So we're going to meet on July the 11th at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| And, you know, you'll hear a lot more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| But, you know, that was the biggest things that we dealt with were that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| how we interact with each other, how we get information for the agenda when we'll have those things approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4526)|
| 1:15:35| I know there were two things on the agenda, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| but I can't think of the second one to save my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| The first one would be properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| We're going to try to deal with titling of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| Again, we haven't talked a thing about it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| We talked a little bit about it at the meeting before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| But, you know, we're going to bring it up kind of fresh and we'll discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| And what was that second item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Joint meeting of the full commission, full school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Full Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Board of Education, school, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| Them and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Us and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Another joint meeting, we'll discuss that, how that should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| And, you know, what our role is in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| Do we set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Do we bring that back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| So that will be another item for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| Was there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| The thing that we asked for was the executive summary sort of thing, which when you receive it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| I hope we get it this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| It would allow discussion at our next full meeting to then be used for input July the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| So I hope we get the executive summary this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| And, you know, we discussed a little bit just to bore you all with things that only the law director really cares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| deeply about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| But there was a lot of discussion on, okay, we get that executive summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| and someone has a question and we get into a back and forth on email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| We don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| And then the facilitator, you know, really I guess the committee members should take questions or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| just really factual accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| If something was said in the meeting that was incorrect, type wrong or whatever, bring that back to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| and not let us get into a debate and he'll resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| And if he can't resolve that issue, we'll just bring it up next meeting and talk about it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| So we're just really in the abundance of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| We want to make sure that we're not communicating in a way that may be perceived as not being following the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| Sunshine Law in its fullness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Anything else that you'd like to add, Mr. Wright or other members of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| We're okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| And, Ms. Royals, you're not going to castigate me today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| I'll save it for after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| I'll walk you down to the parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| I'm almost offended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| So, okay, well, I'm sure that we'll have some joint meeting of some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| and sometime here in the near future and things will get better, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| But, all right, do we have any other items before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Seeing none, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130617?start=4698)|
