| 0:02:15| This is most likely going to be my last devotional for my political career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| Typically, I would call my priest for my devotionals and talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=143)|
| 0:02:32| I usually go to Proverbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| It's one of my favorite books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| Unfortunately, last Sunday he died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| He was a really amazing person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| He was only 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| He's my father's best friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| He was my uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| I've known him for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| He married my wife and myself, so it was tough getting this assignment on a week when I couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| turn to him anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| It was sad, but at the same time, he worked his whole life for God, and now he gets to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=186)|
| 0:03:15| go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| You go through all the emotions of sad and angry, but at the end of the day, I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| I'm selfishly sad for myself because I don't get to see him anymore, but one day, hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| I will again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| I don't really have a verse to give tonight, but I just want everybody to remember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=218)|
| 0:03:47| life is precious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| I've learned this lesson too many times, unfortunately, and lost too many people at a young age, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| feel like, but it is very precious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| This here is a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| It's a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| We could all probably be a little nicer to each other, a little bit more understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| a little bit more patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| When you go home tonight, make sure you tell the people that you love that you love them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=259)|
| 0:04:27| Make sure you smile when you see people in the hallways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| Make sure you ask people how they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=271)|

| 0:04:53| I'd like to thank Richie when he saw me, give me a hug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| You don't always realize what everybody's going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| I saw here last Monday, nobody knew this happened, but those little things, the how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| you're doing, the hug, that what's going on sometimes really does make a big difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| in somebody's life, whether you realize it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=317)|

| 0:10:53| But then I met Mr. Vandebate, wherever he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Mr. Vandebate was down there and he goes, I can remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=658)|

| 0:11:05| He said, a lot of times I was the only one, only one present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=665)|

| 0:11:18| Or nine of us were down in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| So it's an honor and thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=683)|

| 0:13:40| potentially in this group over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=820)|

| 0:13:54| budget and our mayor spearheaded, want to make sure anytime we lean in and work hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| on an investment, we want to make sure that it's working, and so I asked the sheriff how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| his recruitment and retention efforts and our workforce within our law enforcement team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| are doing, and I'm happy to invite you here to give us a little report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=850)|

| 0:14:21| You were handed out a few pages there by Amanda Kitts and Ann Souter, both in our human resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| office, so don't get into those too heavy yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| So it's like kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| You have to hand something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| They won't start looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| They won't start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| I want to go over a few things, and then we'll talk about those as well and some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| and obviously, I'm sure you may have some questions, and as Amanda and Ann both were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| up here, if you have any questions that I can't answer, that's why they're here, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| what is that saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Behind every man there's a good woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Those two right there have been exceptional, helping out and doing anything and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| and taking charge of this, and I'm so grateful for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| So I have to give accolades to both of them for the work that they've done and the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| that they have been able to do with our Merit Council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| So things have been going very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| The Sheriff's Office, we revamped our recruiting initiative by launching what was called Join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| KCSO website and creating a mentorship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| What that meant was when somebody was interested and they went online and signed up for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| we had mentors signed up, employees, that they could contact, and that mentor would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| guide them through the process of what they needed to do, how they needed to do it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| they stayed with them all the way through that process and getting them started with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| our human resources and getting applications done and things such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| We received over 960 employment inquiries through the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| These employment inquiries were assigned to KCSO mentor teams, and it moved on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| The team consisted of 52 individuals with different classifications, such as law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| corrections, civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| It didn't matter, we weren't looking for any specific, but obviously we were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| for corrections and law enforcement, and then we had many civilian positions, so we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| sure that all entities were covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| They personally assisted that applicant through the hiring process and the recruiting team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| and that attends to the local job fairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| We attended the local job fairs and military job fairs throughout the county and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| This combined with KCSO and the merit system working together has allowed us to hire 190| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| individuals to date, with the exception of hiring 200 plus by the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| We also have a recruiting budget of $50,000, and I think we've pretty much expended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| already, but it's been a good thing for us to go through as well, and I think it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| money well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| To kind of give you just a little bit more, our third quarter, 40% increase is due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| the county commission, due to you all approving the pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| I don't believe any of this would have been possible if you all hadn't stepped up, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| I am standing here in front of you today to say thank you to each and every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| for giving us this opportunity, and the men and women of the Noss County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| a salary that I think that the majority is happy with and will continue working on as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| The starting salary, obviously, for correctional officers before July increase was $39,471.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1061)|
| 0:17:49| After July pay increase, that starting salary went to $50,570.94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| Correctional officer starting salary before July was $44,814.35, and after that pay raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| it went to $51,978.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| I will tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| I have been to one TSA, that's the Tennessee Sheriff's Association meeting since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| and I will say that I had many of the 95 sheriffs that were there, I take that back, of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| 95 sheriffs across the state, 82 were there, and they wanted to know how we got it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| And I'll say this, my commission and my mayor's office was gracious and grateful with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| hard work of us, my finance director, Allison Rogers, and Chris Caldwell, and we made it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| There was a lot of work that went into it, but I was very adamant in making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| they knew that this county commission was supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| Because of the influx of applicants in our third quarter, our psychological provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| added another psychologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| That's how busy we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| We had to add on another psychologist to make sure that we could get people through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| process a little bit faster, and you'll see one of those pages that you have there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| give you an idea of how the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| It was taken anywhere from 45 to 50 days or so, and now we've got that cut down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| 30 days, and I think you'll see that within there, and it's made a huge difference for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| So, very grateful for our staff in our human resources office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| Here's the number I think everybody's interested in, and it's going to be a little bit of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Currently we have, get this now, we have seven corrections and 16 patrol officer vacancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1183)|

| 0:19:53| What that means is we already have people in the process right now that have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| been offered, and depending on where they are in the process, right now we only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1197)|
| 0:20:05| those positions available to offer to somebody else outside of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| That is telling an awful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Now am I happy with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| I'm happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Am I ecstatic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| No, because I want to see it full, and I think any CEO, anybody that owns a business wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| to see their employment where it should be, and that's where I want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| The 16 patrol officers, that's patrol law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| That could involve people in our courts, and uniformed bodies is what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| So it kind of gives you an idea there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| We have 33 applicants currently going through the hiring process, so that's where that seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1243)|
| 0:20:52| and 16 number, if all of those 33 go or are accepted, then that's all we have left to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| be able to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| I did tell the mayor, and I think, I don't remember if I come to this body, whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| we approved, you all approved the pay raise, we gave up 28 corrections positions, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| told them I may have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| I hope that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| You probably hope that I don't, but I hope that I do just for the fact that it shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| what's happening and what's caused because of what you all are approving with this pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Those 33 applicants currently going through the hiring process, 23 of those are corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| three for patrol, and four support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| That could be people within our records division or anywhere else in our civilian area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| Together the Knox County Sheriff's Office and the merit system work diligently to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| the most qualified applicants to fill our current vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| This has been a team effort with the Sheriff's Office and with the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| I'm very proud of both of the entities, the way they've worked well to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| this has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| I also want to thank the recruiting team, our mentors, and the men and women that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| been out here promoting the agency on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| So with that being said, kind of give you an idea on our retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| As of November of this year, our exit data consists of a total of 115 employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| have retired, resigned, and unfortunately terminated or left for personal reasons compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| to 22, with that total number being 185, which is a 60% decrease from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| It's made a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| One of the things that I know, it was a little bit of a contention and me begging you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| to drop our age to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| I have had 13 applicants, 18-year-olds, that have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| So far we've hired five 18-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| So that means a lot to me, and it means a lot that you were concerned enough, but yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| you were also allowing me to be able to go out here and hire those individuals that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| want to come into this profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| I'm very grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| So thank you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| We've also had 12 employees come back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| They've rehired, and this is their statement, it was because of the pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| If I can get them back, if I can get that experience back, I'm going to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| Just to kind of give you an idea, too, with all this, what I consider good news, the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| of the downside would be come between now and the end of December, I have 10 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Now, there's nothing I can do about people who have 25, 30-plus years that decided that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| this has been enough for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| But this is the step that we have to have to be able to fill the positions of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| people in a command supervisory role, and we've got to get those individuals that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1435)|
| 0:24:04| So this is a good start for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| So what I'll do right now, if you all will allow me to do so, the hiring process form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| that you have in front of you, again, I think it's kind of self-explanatory, gives you an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| idea of where we are once a person comes into contact with us and that applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| That's where we are today and how things are moving along, just to kind of give you an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| idea of how long it takes us to get them through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| That's one of the reasons why we've had to hire another psychologist to do our psychologicals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| to help move that along, expedite that situation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| So if you have any questions, we'll go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| The next form, and I'm sure I'm going to have to call the two ladies up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| They can explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Our total number of applicants, you see there in front of you on the one chart that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1492)|
| 0:25:01| the more, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Brown color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Kind of gives you a breakdown, and it gives you one of the things I think, too, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| are concerned with, well, why did they not make it through the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Over on the right-hand column, you see those definitions of why they didn't make it, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| it didn't make it through us as the Knox County Sheriff's Office or through the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| And if they don't make it through the Merit Council, they don't make it to us, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| It doesn't get to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| So those failures from the Merit Council could be anything from a no-show assessment testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| a false application, which they either held something back or didn't want us to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| about or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Their criminal history didn't pass through the Merit Council's regulations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| And obviously, if it does make it to us, then there's reasons up there of why they may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| have passed our interview process, if you will, as far as a failed background, failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| drug test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| When we give somebody an offer of condition, that means, okay, you're going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| We're going to go ahead and give you a psychological, a physical, things such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| But that is contingent on you passing that for that offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| So we don't just hire them, put them to work, and then do all this later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| We'd be out of so much money, and then we'd be in trouble, and I'd be in trouble from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| But we're moving these things quite along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| So the exit, the next piece of paper that you have there in front of you, the exit data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| breakdown kind of gives you an idea, I think, which is a number that I talked about with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| retention as well, kind of gives you reasons of why they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| And we offer an exit interview to everybody, but not everybody will fulfill that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| So if you all have any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| And if I can't answer it, I've got two young ladies that can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| So again, let me reiterate, I'm very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| I stand up here in front of you and say thank you to each and every one of you for allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| us to continue within the Sheriff's Office to have a salary for these men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| That really meant a lot to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| It meant a lot to me to make sure that we got that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| And a lot of times, you know, we as elected office holders, we get up here and ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| But I thought it was very important for this community for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| And you all stepped up and I'm grateful for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Are there any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| I don't think I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| I just want to make a statement to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| These numbers are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| And I think we're definitely leading in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| So I'm really happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| You know, I've had to reach out to you numerous times last month or so with things in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| And I really don't think people think about all of the work that you guys have to do for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| neighborhood parking issues to, you know, very dangerous issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| And so I just wanted to be able to have this opportunity to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| I've done that privately, but I wanted to do that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| You've had a rough couple of months, and so has your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| And I just, you know, I just want to thank you all for the job that you do and for always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| being there for me anyways, to answer my calls and take care of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1736)|

| 0:29:11| And so I wasn't gonna be this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| I'm honored to be leading this agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| But to to have lost one of my people is very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| But I'm thankful for this community and I'm thankful for this this council or committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1766)|

| 0:29:45| Allison Rogers, I think all of you know that as hard as she worked with me on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| And Amanda and Ann that are sitting back there for my human resource office, they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| very instrumental in putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| And I'm very grateful for the work that they've been doing to make sure that that our potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| applicants are getting the assistance that they need and making sure we get people hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| for this for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I didn't mean to ramble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| Next on our agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| This is for agenda items only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| And the first person I have down is Stephanie Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| Stephanie, if you'd state your name and county of residence and you'll have three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1827)|
| 0:30:39| to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Hello, I'm Stephanie Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| I'm a lifelong resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| I was raised in the Dole community and now reside with my family on the farm that adjoins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| both sides of the old Dandridge Stagecoach proposed road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| We've lived there for a little over a decade and you may ask why this proposed road closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| is now coming or being asked to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Well, actually, the Lang family, unfortunately, a member of their family was sick and she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| sold the last nine acres that allowed us to join our farm to Old Dandridge Stagecoach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| The Pierce family, which is the second family that's listed on the proposal, they bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| a home at the end of Old Dandridge Stagecoach, which was the Lane's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| And at that home, they thought they were moving into a quiet, tranquil East Knox County piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| And it's been anything but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| And I'm going to list a few things, which we'd like to tell the Knox County Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| thank you, because they've had to assist in a lot of them over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| But the first year that we built our home on the farm, we had over 42 trespassers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| used this road to access our farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Now, as awful as that sounds, it was actually quite innocent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| It was hunters, fathers, uncles, generational hunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| The past two years have not been so innocent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| There was an incident where another neighbor asked why people were trespassing, which resulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| in shots fired into the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| There has been numerous individuals from East Knox County area that use this dead-end road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| as a shooting range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| If we're lucky, they're shooting into the rock bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| If not, just like three weeks ago, they shot towards my residence with my teenagers outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| People are very open with why they've pulled down there, maybe to do smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Again, I'm not talking cigarettes or other drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| You can go down there and find baggies, drug paraphernalia, condoms, and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| So, both the Nichols and the Pierce family, we'd like to express our gratitude for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| consideration on the Old Dandridge Road closure, and also, due to escalating security reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1975)|
| 0:33:04| we feel that the closure is imperative for not only our well-being and the safety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| the individuals who live on Old Dandridge Stagecoach, but as well as the East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| Our next speaker is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Keith, you have signed up for two matters on the agenda, and these two combined, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2000)|
| 0:33:32| allow you a total of six minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| If you'd introduce yourself, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Keith Britt, 506 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| I will be striking my comments from item number 11, so I'll just be speaking to one item tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| I have struggled with the prospect of this ambulance contract for the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| At your last work session, I urged you to pass it because this contract, while completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| unsatisfactory, is better than no contract at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| I've tried to put myself in your shoes, and I think about my first and foremost responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| being a father to my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| I take parenting very seriously, and I live by a three-part code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| One of those codes is I have to set the example for the people I want my children to become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| In terms of this ambulance contract, what example are we going to be setting if we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| a contract with a provider that has a long history of failure, a provider that hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| even come close to showing that it can satisfy the very lax standards in this proposed contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2075)|
| 0:34:44| a provider that is likely depending on fee and penalty waivers like it has done over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| and over again for the last $8 million, a provider that has demonstrated in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| that if it finds it to be a profitable decision, they will abandon Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| What does a yes vote mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| It means that we've let somebody push us around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| It means that we don't believe in ourselves enough to stand up and do the moral thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| It means that becoming a coward, while undesirable, is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| What would a no vote mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| It would mean that we have standards and we're not willing to lower them because our standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| literally mean the difference between life and death for a lot of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| It would mean that while it may set a lump in our throat, we have the confidence, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| have the faith that in the next 72 days, we can find a solution that doesn't sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| the health and welfare of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| I saw the work session and Mr. Moyers, I heard you shoot down Commissioner Schoonmaker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| emergency powers argument and I don't wholly disagree with you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| I found your legal footing to be pretty steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| But it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| It absolutely can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| We've won wars in less than 72 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| We've stopped global economic collapse in less than 72 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| I believe in this commission and if you give yourself the proper motivation, you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| Our next speaker is Constance Avery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2188)|
| 0:36:39| I notice you also have signed up for two agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| You'll have a total of six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| My name is Constance Avery, Knox County, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| So yeah, I'm going to speak first to the first item, which is item number 31, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| was involving the child, Tennessee Department of Children's Services, dealing with a juvenile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| probation officer's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| But I think there's a greater elephant that needs to be talked about in this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| The Richard Bean Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| As you all should be known, fully aware of, that the report is rolled out thanks to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| big media platform that has revealed that we are dealing with a juvenile detention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| that has a leadership who proudly vocated that he's abusing children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| I am pleased to hear that the state legislators are stepping up and are actually requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| investigation into the matter, but this is in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| And so my question is, Knox County, since Tom Spangler is down here and everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| what are we doing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Because this is in our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| And it's concerning, because if we know for a fact that this was a parent, if this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| a daycare center, if this was a youth after-school program, a rec, I'm sorry, a youth sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| program, any of such natures, anyone else would be charged, sitting in jail right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| the program or whatever it be should be shut down, defunded immediately, and the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| would be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| And yet somehow, this man was confident to say not only was he openly willing to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| he treated every child that came in there like a murderer, because of what the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| may or may not be for them to be there, but then he came behind that and said he was making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| millions of dollars off of it, and had no intentions of ever slowing down or stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| See, when I hear that kind of language by somebody like this type of man, it lets me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| know that money's funded into our elected officials' pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| He's making a lot of people money to turn their heads and have a blind eye to the matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| of these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| And we know by experts that when you have children who are dealing with trauma in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| type of manner from a system, the system that they're supposed to be able to trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| the system that we all lean on in our time of need, that this leads to farther greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| matters such as them growing up and becoming greater harms and threats to our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| like murderers and child rapists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Let's not forget KPD, child rapists running through the KPD department right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| So that's the concern here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Why are we not addressing the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Why are you all taking a blind eye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Which leads me right into the ambulance service, because now we had another report came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| that told us that AMR has paid some of our elected officials up here $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Particularly you, Terry Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| See, you was in the comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| And you made a statement saying that somehow this money would not influence your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| Well, if that's the case, then why did you even take the money in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| How about we don't take no money at all, so we don't have to worry about this being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| factor coming in here tonight with them on the agenda for a vote of approval of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Which somebody already said before, y'all don't listen to us, trust me, we know this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| as taxpayers and as voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Y'all do not listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Because if you listen to us, you would know that by now, we want an ambulatory service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| not just one, but multiple, because people are literally dying waiting for the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| Dying waiting for the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| We're talking about elderly members, we're talking about like 60 and up people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Some of y'all are in that age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Now think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| And the irony is that you all are taking money that's criminal, that's corruption, that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| I cannot trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| And I cannot trust the decisions that you make, nor can I trust the back door room deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| you're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Because obviously, all they got to do is pay you, and they pay for the vote, no matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| how crappy, no matter how poorly, no matter how terribly they perform in their so-called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| job descriptions and contractual agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| So this is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| And I start to wonder, what does Charm Allitt actually do as a district attorney, besides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| harass black activists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Because it seems like she don't hold her police departments accountable, she don't hold our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| elected officials accountable, she don't hold the detention centers in her jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| So what does the woman actually do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| This is beyond ridiculous, and it's no better on the city side than it is on the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| So basically, Knoxville, we just got a bunch of crap leadership going on all around at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| And everybody acting like we're supposed to pat you on the back, we're supposed to applaud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| your awards, we're supposed to act like you really done something great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| When we got children outside dying, we got homeless people sleeping outside, we got families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| losing their homes daily through the eviction courts, we have inefficiencies in our education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| we have poor public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| The list is long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| And you all sit up here and waste our money, fund it to corruptive departments, sit up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| here and take money on backdoor scenes and behind-the-scenes funding, and then act like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| somehow we should applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| This is hilarious to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| So I really hope that the state legislator brings in the necessary investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| I really hope that it brings DOJ in to start bringing some investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| I really hope you all who are accountable for your failures and your lack of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| and more importantly, your own corruption, are also held accountable, because I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| can't seem to understand that a child by the name of Andy Thompson Jr. was murdered and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| several of you all had nothing but racist, bigotry comments to make about him, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| sit up here taking money for endless votes for contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| And I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| And that concludes our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2512)|

| 0:48:50| and our police chief want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2930)|

| 0:49:18| part of this job overwhelmingly challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| I think that the overnight response, the 3am, two nasty dogs in the back of a car during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| a traffic stop, those types of things, especially the nights and weekends stuff, is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| I think that you will be back before this commission in a matter of years saying, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| out of space, please buy us a bigger facility and ask for more money and I think the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| will continue to balloon and you'll be back here asking us for more resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=2984)|

| 0:51:54| If I were on commission, I would vote for this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| This is not an extension of the existing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| It is an entirely new, vastly improved agreement providing much needed financial and operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3121)|

| 0:52:12| We don't live in a perfect world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| But what we're proposing is an important step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| I understand that many of you have legitimate concerns about this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| At the same time, the other options that we've heard and have been suggested are fraught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3144)|

| 0:52:38| off the subsidy, all the way to an unrestricted right of cancellation upon 180 days notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| And I urge you, echoing what Commissioner Frazier said last week, to hold the vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| accountable to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| And my office will be your partner along the way in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| AMR has agreed to present a progress report to Commission quarterly, providing you with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| ongoing status reports straight from the company, as well as the opportunity to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| direct questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| They have also agreed to make numerous improvements and changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| I ask that you trust and respect the procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| It was fair, objective, and free from political influences, and I'd like to thank everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| who was part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| It was a lot of hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| I cannot overstate the importance of certainty and stability in the EMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3207)|
| 0:53:34| Since the Notice of Intent to Award was announced, we have seen significant gains in the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| of available EMS staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| This reflects that stability in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| We now routinely see 20 or 25 trucks on the road daily, with improved staffing both throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| the week and on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| All of this could be thrown into disarray depending on what this body does here this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Knox County is a big operation, and despite recent challenges, things do work relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| In 2022, AMR answered an average of 175 calls a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| In 2023, they're answering an average of 190 calls a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| Patients are being cared for every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Approving this contract will help ensure that care is maintained and continues to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| in 2024 and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Now I'm going to turn the floor over to the subject matter experts, who will be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| As always, thank you for your service to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| I believe we'll move forward now with commission questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| Mr. Myers, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| He's going to get the same question from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Again, I'll go with Mr. Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Mr. Britt said that we may be, not exact words, may be stuck with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| I see us moving forward with AMR, and one year, we will know if they've improved or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Then we could give, and I say we, this commission, I won't be setting here, this commission in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| a year to 16 months can ask for it to be re-bid again, because there's a 180-day clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| It's in section 801 and 802 of the current contract that's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| I apologize, Madam Chair, Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| So, that's the most important part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I'm looking to go forward, and hopefully, in a perfect world, everything would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3342)|
| 0:55:51| We'll get more nurses out of college, in the working force, and everything's going to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| But if it don't, AMR's got to, they will have to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| There's no doubt about that, and we will know that in 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| And there's, this commission will have an out if it needs an out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| I didn't say anything last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| I'm just going to state my opinion that really hasn't changed in over the last year that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| we've been dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| I've always been of the opinion of a two-service solution, split between across I-40 and anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3383)|
| 0:56:32| within the 640 loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Both should be able to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| That's always been my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| I made that clear to everybody involved, and anything in services that talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| I don't think, you know, there's been a lot of finger pointing at AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| I don't think AMR is necessarily the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| I think they got put into a situation where they were set up to fail to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| I don't know, I don't have the confidence, I should say, that this situation is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| much better that they're not being set up to fail again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| So for me, it's been, it's just one part of the whole entire cog, it's with one cog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3428)|
| 0:57:17| in the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| So for me, it's been a challenge going back and forth over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| But basically, just wanted to state that I still believe the two system is better than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| a single system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| And I'm more disappointed in the contract than I am, have problems with whoever won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| the contract fair and square is whoever won it fair and square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| Doesn't matter what the company name is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| So that's kind of my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| And I wanted to take the time to thank everyone who's been a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| I'm pretty certain that we can all agree that our current approach to the provision of emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| services, it no longer meets the growing demand or the ever-changing health care landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| And it's going to take time and a collective effort to address all of the factors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| contribute to the challenges that we're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| I know that a great amount of work on this effort has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| We started with an assessment of emergency services by Fitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| We developed an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| There was review and scoring, an update of the contract, bringing forth the review committee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Overall, I just want to state that I think that there was process integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| And at the end of the day, we have a much, much better contract that will enable Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| County to have more oversight, more accountability, and a broader range of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| However, after a great deal of consideration, and I want to emphasize that, a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| of consideration, it's my opinion that there are still a few things about the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| that caused me to pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Even with paramedic quick response vehicles to provide treatment while a transport vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| is in route, and even with the understanding that recommended response times are the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| not the floor, I would have liked the RFP to be based on the CFAI response time baselines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| and benchmarks provided in the Fitch report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| I would have also liked to have seen more zones countywide in the deployment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| I'm not in favor of increasing penalty times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| I would have liked a bond amount equitable to the subsidy, despite industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| I also think that because the landscape of emergency services and healthcare in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| is constantly changing, that the terms of the contract should reflect such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| These are all things that I did ask to be considered, but understand could not be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| because they were not a part of the RFP, and commission was not a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| I was happy to see that my recommendation for peer agency surveys was included in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| revised contract, so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| I've said this often, that interagency communication is key, and it will continue to be the key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| to success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| So like Mr. Commissioner Ward said, it's not so much the recommendation out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| committee, it's just I take pause with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| So with all this said, I just want to state that I have made the very, very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| decision to respectfully vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| I want to say one last thing, though, that no matter how the votes fall, I have always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| been and I will continue to be committed to working with all agencies to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| we, as a county, are continually improving and adapting our approach to emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| I too prepared some notes, just because this has been an amazingly dense process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| I know all of us have read so much and talked to so many people, and there's a lot to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| I also want to echo, I know how much work has been done by the Jacobs Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| and our procurement team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| This is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Your efforts are absolutely not unnoticed, and you guys do an amazing amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| There is a lot of good that's come out of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| We will have a new medical director that will be focused and will be a Knox County employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| to oversee the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| That's a huge improvement, and I hope that person is found and they are a great asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| I think it's a very good thing that Knox County E911 will take over dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| It will own the software and the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| I think the dispatching will improve, and I think that they will focus on constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3717)|
| 1:02:05| analyzing the data, and I'm happy to know that we will drive that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| The overall contract, the new contract is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| It's more modernized, helps address the state of our current healthcare system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| There's some good things that have come out of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| I do have to say, like my colleagues, I'm a little disappointed at where we are right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| We, as commissioners, we weren't included or consulted on drafting the key elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| of the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| There are a lot of things that I wish were different when we started this process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| got the vendors to bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Like Commissioner Ward said, I really do think we could have had multiple providers supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| different services, giving bidders an option to bid on some or major or all those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| and having multiple vendors work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| We're growing too fast to rely on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| I still can't understand why we're giving private insurance a subsidy and helping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| out by capping reimbursements for the free market enterprise system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| It's against every notion I have for free market principles, and I think it would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| us less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| We weren't involved with the selection of the committee that scored it or was part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I would have loved to have seen more representation from key stakeholders and more key comparative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| metrics, past performance, financial health, employee relations, the list goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| But because of the structure of the process and for other reasons, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| The legislative body wasn't afforded the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| We can't amend the terms, change the contract, determine the vendors, or make any alterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| We're in a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| We're asked against a rush timeline to just say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| That's where we are, and that's part of the structure of government, so I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| But from where I sit, it's hard for me to not take more into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| I, like Commissioner Frazier, represent nearly 500,000 people, and my job is to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| best decision for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| Throughout this process, I've heard from so many people across from Knox County, seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| EMS professionals, first responders, hospital administrators, nurses, patients, caregivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| everyday citizens who've used the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| I want to thank them for having really candid conversations over the phone, via email, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| the field, nights and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Something that struck me as I reviewed a lot of those, and I put all this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| and stayed up a long time last night, in over the hundred conversations and emails that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| I had documented, only one person had anything positive to say about our current ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| It just tells me something about the confidence of our community in rehiring our current vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| In addition to the hundreds of times in the last few months where AMR was at level zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| meaning there were no ambulances available to help citizens, last week was a really difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| moment for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| On Thursday afternoon at 4.03, I was informed that once again, AMR was at a level zero status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| with four calls holding and no emergency units available to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| Let that sink in for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Normal afternoon, no major crisis, no major crashes, no national disasters, nothing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| of the norm, and the situation was so strained on a normal day, I can't imagine what it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| look like during a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| I respect the process, the broadest decision, I really do, but I've lost confidence personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| in AMR as an ambulance provider, I believe our community has as well, and I will vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| no on this contract approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| If you get six votes AMR, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| If you get the opportunity to work in Knox County, I wish you the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| I'm just one vote out of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| If that's the case, I really do hope you prove me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| I hope you are very successful, I hope you take care of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| However, I think Knox County needs a new path forward and a new ambulance provider, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| I'll be voting no tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Thank you very much, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| I've got a couple of questions for Director Partin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3968)|
| 1:06:16| Kevin Partin, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| Last Monday, prior to the work session, we were told there was a red line copy that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| changed numerous portions of the contract, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Okay, and then you were kind enough to send us the red line copy so we could actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| study it and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| Do you by chance have a copy of that red line contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| No sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| If not, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Well, just a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| Do you believe that in the contract that you're going to be able to, we're going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| to hire a medical director at $50,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| That's the current standard across the nation according to Fitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| So obviously, we'll see where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| And then on page 18 of the red line version, there's some numbers that need to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4027)|
| 1:07:16| And I can point those out to you later because you're saying 60 days and then you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| in parentheses 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| So which way is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| And this is supposed to be the changes to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| Is there anything in this contract that spells out that AMR will provide service at our high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| school football games?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| No sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| We were kind of told that the Fitch report is our guide to make our decisions from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| Would you agree with that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| That's what we built our RFP off of, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Was the evaluation committee given this report prior to their scoring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| It's available to anybody that would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| It's an open document, but we didn't physically hand it to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| They didn't get a copy of this before they started scoring the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| No sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| They're there to score the proposers, not necessarily the Fitch report, which was only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| a data collection and recommendation tool of the prior contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| I tried to perform kind of a factual analysis of all the information that all of us have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| gotten here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| As you can see on the screen, that was the information that I requested from you on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| fees that AMR were assessed from your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| Is that the correct numbers up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Well, in 2018, that is the year that AMR got their second renewal of their contract, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4125)|
| 1:08:56| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| This body had to give them the opportunity to renew that contract, and there were several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| commissioners that at that point in time that really emphasized that maybe we should put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| it out at that point for an RFP, but the majority said to go ahead and go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4150)|
| 1:09:18| Based on the data that you see there, it seems like every year that they've had the extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| of the contract, their fines have increased dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| And in 2018, we were promised that they would do better, they would continue to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| the right way, but yet your data right there doesn't hold water, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4176)|
| 1:09:47| I would say that teaches us a lesson to not allow a contract to go 10 years without looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| to change it along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Can you do the next slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| And then since this was our guide to make decisions from, if you can kind of scroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| down to the bottom, at the bottom of the page there, the Fitch report basically says, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| if any commissioner has their Fitch report, it's on the bottom of 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4208)|
| 1:10:16| It basically says the contractor did not meet the 90th percentile requirement for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| years 2021 and 2022, even with the seven-minute allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4221)|
| 1:10:29| And that was the standard of 10 minutes plus an additional seven minutes, meaning 17 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| and they couldn't hit it in 2021 and 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| And now the new contract wants us to go to 20 minutes, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| The new contract outside of the city incorporated does have a 20-minute response time, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| would be better than the response time that the outlying areas are receiving now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| I was actually, this is fascinating to me, because kind of like Commissioner Jay, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| like the numbers, but are you aware that the Knoxville Fire Department actually keeps data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| on their 911 calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I'm sure all first responding agencies probably keep data on their calls, or at least I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| Well, what was interesting is they provided me with just the month of September of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| So inside the city of Knoxville that were 911 calls designated to their jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| there was over 1,100 calls for service during that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| And like you said, inside the city, they are required to meet that 10-minute threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| It's 17 minutes as of the last amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| Inside the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| As of the last amendment, it's 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Well, they met that 47% of the time inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| That was 524 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| More than 10 minutes response time was 20% of the calls, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| That was 222 out of the 1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| What's also fascinating to me that individuals called in and requested an ambulance, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| because of the wait time, 24 were transported by privately owned vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4341)|
| 1:12:29| In fact, one of the vehicles that transported a patient was the battalion chief of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| But then the last number I thought was kind of really interesting was that in the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| of September, when the 911 call came in and it was determined it was in the city of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| jurisdiction, there were 289 calls for services where no ambulances were available at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Now, if that means the call came in at noon and then at 12.05 there were ambulances available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| that could have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| At 1.05, ambulances could have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| But I thought that was interesting that that high percentage, there were no ambulances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| available within the core center of Knox County to be able to handle the citizens who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| live in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| And it's kind of unfortunate that you guys in the health department don't get to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| those numbers because you really don't know then what actually is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| That's why in the new contract we'll own all the software that allows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| Right, and hopefully that will get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| The other thing is under the new contract, Knox County is going to pay a little over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| $172,000 a month to AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| And then in the contract, if they don't meet the deliverables, those fines are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| be deducted from the $172,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| And then one of the things I thought was interesting, nowhere in this total conversation is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| I'm not sure if the other vendors that were vying for this contract, and if they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| known this information, would they have reduced their subsidy requirements to very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| to AMR, but how much does AMR actually receive on a yearly basis from their ambulance subscription| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| fee that they charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| You know, most of us know that the rural metro charges us a fire fee, but also people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| paying as part of that, if they want to, they can tack on the ambulance subscription| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| fee, which is additional revenue for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| So when you say in the contract that if their profitability is above 12%, is that going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4494)|
| 1:15:02| to include the subscription fee that they're getting from Knox County citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| That would be included in their revenue numbers, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| But so I guess my question is, if the other people who applied as a vendor were aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| of the subscription service, they might have lowered their estimate instead of being above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| the $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| We would need to ask AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| I'm not aware that the subscription service is still, that you can sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| Yeah, I had a call today from a very, yeah, they pay a yearly fee for an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| I'm sure that somebody pays for it, I just don't know that you can still sign up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| I believe that was from rural metro days where it carried over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| Well they paid it this year, so it, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| And again, we are the third largest county in Tennessee, and I know I've said that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| several times on several issues over the years, but I'm kind of like Commissioner Jay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| Commissioner Frazier, I feel like we're taking a step backwards with this new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| And you know, we should have been going, instead of increasing the time for the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| for Richie's area and stuff and Commissioner Lee's area to 20 minutes, we should be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4579)|
| 1:16:27| from 17 minutes down to 14 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| We should be trying to do better to get that service to the constituent who needs it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| a timely basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| And again, if this contract goes through, they're not going to hold Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4602)|
| 1:16:51| or Mayor Williams or even Mayor Jacobs' feet to the fire, they're going to hold, the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| is going to hold the 11 members of this body's feet to the fire if this doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| So after completing a factional analysis, I am not in favor of supporting this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| renewal, or a new contract, excuse me, for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| This is one of those votes, you know, I sat in this seat for five years and cast quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4643)|
| 1:17:32| a few votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| Some of them are tough, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Some of them are, you really remember them, because of just how you labor over deciding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| this is definitely one of those votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| And I guess in a way it is what we sign up for, because we want to be part of the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| making process that affects Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| But of course the risk in that, the inherent risk in that, is no matter how much research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| you do and no matter how much you labor and debate and gather information, sometimes you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4680)|
| 1:18:08| make a decision, it might not turn out to be the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| You just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Sometimes you just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| I'm going to tell you how I'm going to vote, and then I'm going to kind of tell you how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| I got to the decision, just like my colleagues have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| You probably know how I'm going to vote, because I've seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| I intend to vote yes on this, and I'm going to tell you how I got to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| Everybody arrives at their decision a little bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| And let me just say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| I know beyond a shadow of a doubt there is not a person on this dais that would cast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| a vote either way on this for any self-serving reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| I know that about these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| That's just, that's not in the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| Having said that, you know, we'll vote, we'll end up voting differently, I'm sure, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| You know, I've heard a lot of information, I've gotten a lot of emails, phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4744)|

| 1:19:19| of this bid process, and I'm voting yes on this, because it boiled down to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4759)|
| 1:19:32| I believe we need a contract, and I believe we need a contract approved tonight that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| ready to take effect February 1st, 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| That's no disrespect to any provider's ability to come in at the 11th hour and save the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| I don't doubt anyone's ability to do that who says they could do that, but that isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| We're looking for a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| In Mayor Jacobs' words, we need a contract that is fixed and stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| Again, I may be quoting the mayor, I don't know, but is it perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| How could it possibly be perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Is it better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| I do think it is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| I think even some of my colleagues who have said they are probably not going to vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| it admit that there's been some good things that have come out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| But ultimately, whether or not this contract is a success or a failure is going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| down to the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| You guys got to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| If we vote to approve this contract, you guys got to get it done, and if you don't, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| going to be right back here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| I will remind us of what Commissioner Daley said, that the county has protections in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| contract to revisit if it's not getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| I wanted to make a comment or two on what Mr. Brett said, and not to pick on Mr. Brett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| I know what my colleague already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| It shows you were listening, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| I appreciate Mr. Brett's remarks, but even if I disagree with him, he always presents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| them in a way that's articulate and civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| But just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| The cowardice part, listen, depending on your motivation, a yes or a no vote could be cowardly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4880)|
| 1:21:28| in a case like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| I don't think that necessarily has to do with which way you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| In terms of our ability to do things in 72 days, I don't think Knox County can print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Last I checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| It's not as easy as winning a war in terms of financing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| For all those reasons, I believe that it's incumbent upon this commission to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| this contract, imperfect as it may be, and then hold the provider's feet to the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| or revisit it when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| I do have a few comments I'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| Commissioner Beeler, you were very articulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| It is one of those votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| It just doesn't feel quite right either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4941)|
| 1:22:34| I am going to move forward on this, and like Commissioner Beeler, I kind of feel the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| to tell you why also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Not because I think everything's going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| I know that we've got a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| But I do appreciate that this is a new contract and that we have safeguards built into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| that we did not have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| I think that is of critical importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| I don't appreciate the fact that the contract was written and then, if any of us wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4979)|
| 1:23:13| to propose any changes, that it was not impossible but extremely difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=4993)|
| 1:23:23| I do respect the integrity of the process, but I do hope in the future that there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| be a little bit more involvement and input from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| That made it very difficult for us, although I appreciate, in the other realm, the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| that perhaps you were trying to protect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| But either way, we are the ones up here having to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| So in your effort to protect us, perhaps, was not what we all hoped that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5027)|
| 1:23:55| And when I say protect us, I mean protect us from any undue influence in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| I do appreciate that we have the out contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| I'm not pretending for a minute it wouldn't be very difficult to pull, that it would cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| a lot of disruption, but it is there if things do not work as we intend for them to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5051)|
| 1:24:20| I do appreciate the fact that we are going to have our own medical director and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| that medical director is going to have full access to software that we are going to own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| and we are going to be able to request and run numbers ourselves so that we will know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| if this situation is, in fact, improving or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| I do appreciate the stepped up accountability with the quarterly reports that we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5081)|
| 1:24:48| to be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| I do appreciate the fact that out of our subsidy that we will be paying every month, that fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| will no longer be excused or forgiven, that it will come off the top of that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5098)|
| 1:25:05| I think that all these things serve to prove to whoever the next contractor would be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5105)|
| 1:25:12| we mean business and that if we don't get it right this time, that it's not even going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5112)|
| 1:25:20| to be a five-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| Another thing that I very much appreciate that I wish were further along in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| but I'm glad it has at least started, is our health care task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5129)|
| 1:25:38| If you could, Mr. Parton, just very, very briefly please explain to especially those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| that are watching what that task force is, in fact, charged with doing, recognizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| this issue is not just an ambulance issue, but it is truly a health care issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5151)|
| 1:25:59| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| So what I charged Mr. Hamby to do was, after the Fitch report came out and we started to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| realize the issues and the problems that are surrounding not just EMS, but the health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| community itself, was to get some stakeholders from each one, start out very small, identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5170)|
| 1:26:18| issues that they're seeing, and kind of, as Commissioner Fraser talked about, break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| down the silos of what's actually going on in our health care system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| At their first meeting, they actually found, I think, four issues in terms of discharge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5187)|
| 1:26:34| behavioral transports, which we know, the culture of low-acuity patients being driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| into the 911 system or into the ED when they didn't necessarily need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| And then, of course, everybody's hated word, staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| And so what they do is they take, they've only met-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| And who is they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| So this would be members from each one of our hospital partners, and then AMR currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| attends as the EMS provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| And then once they isolate a problem, for instance, discharge, the hospitals are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| on getting data for us so that we can analyze that to see where the gaps might be that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| could fill, perhaps, as ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| Do we need to look for a service to help with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| The second meeting was about behavioral transports, just behavioral patients inside the ED itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| And so what we do is we take the next meeting and we bring those partners in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| So they had all of our local behavioral health partners come in and work with not only the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| hospitals, but with AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| Can we divert that individual from the ED?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| So that's kind of the charge that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| And so far, we're getting there slowly, unfortunately, but surely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| And the role of the health department is to actually want to facilitate or organize or-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| We're the neutral ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| No fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| You actually have no authority to make anyone do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| In fact, can call what it is, what it is, and put it out there with the good faith that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5287)|
| 1:28:19| all the providers will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Everybody's working in the same direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| I'm being kind of quiet on this, just really listening to everyone's thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| And I totally get where my fellow commissioners, Commissioner Frazier, Commissioner Jay, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| Commissioner Schoolmaker is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| I also understand where Commissioner Beeler and Commissioner Daly is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| As a person who works in healthcare for the past 18 years, it's bad out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5334)|
| 1:29:07| There are a lot of people that are not getting served because there's not enough people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| I've seen so much, so many people are living alone, suffering whatever illness, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5356)|
| 1:29:25| no one there for them to call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| I see where the needs are not being met when people need basic medications or maybe a walker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| for assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5376)|

| 1:39:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| You want to talk first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| No, after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| I was trying to put my name in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| Didn't understand the hand signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| First off, we get a packet of 13 pages on the morning of the commission meeting, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5985)|
| 1:39:54| the commission staff has to run around and scan this document and then copy it, scan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| it and send it to us, and then copy it and put it in these folders all for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| I'm glad somebody realized that we have no header from anybody's name, address, email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6008)|
| 1:40:19| there's no signatures, there's no corporate name, there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| I think the rules committee needs to make a decision that when we get things like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6023)|
| 1:40:30| delivered to the commission office, that it goes in the circular file, or it goes in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| mailbox, but the commission office shouldn't have to stop what they're doing and run around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| This is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| At this point, we have no idea who sent this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| Complete waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6050)|

| 1:41:09| Yeah, or some input from some of my colleagues, do you think this is a complete waste of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| for us and the staff and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| I mean, this could have come from Connecticut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| We have no idea where this came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6079)|

| 1:41:33| It will go in the circular file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| In the past, we've had mail sent to us with nobody's address on it, no return address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| You do open it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| I did open those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6103)|

| 1:41:46| If you're not brave enough to put your name on there, don't send it because I am not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6111)|

| 1:41:59| There's a rounded rectangular file right back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| Mine's already in it, unopened, but I would say anonymous communications don't need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| be disseminated to the commissioners, but I would encourage the Rules Committee to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| that in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| That's a second request to have the Rules Committee look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120?start=6137)|
