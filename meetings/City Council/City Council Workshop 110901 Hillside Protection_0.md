| 0:11:42| I'm getting all disorganized, Larry, I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=702)|
| 0:12:00| The first issue tonight that was brought up in question was the concept of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| development and basically what was asked, the question was asked and I'd like us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| talk about for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| We're going to kind of do this force field discussion as we did before where we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| about what we hear are strengths and weaknesses and do some comparative look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| The question was asked to me, is the commercial development end to limiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=740)|
| 0:12:29| It seems to me that I can tell from the conversations I've had with MPC and with others is first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| of all we need to remember that all pre-existing and commercially zoned properties in the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| and ridgetop protection area are not affected by this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| Someone asked me recently, if it's already zoned, does this change, and apparently no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| So we now move into this discussion of those, but what happens when there is new zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| What happens when you want to build in those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| The current plan says that non-residential use on slopes over 15% can be built via planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| development zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| If you look in your general plan, you can see that page 65, you see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| The proposed plan pretty much says the same thing it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| You guys helped me with this, but it says planned commercial zoning districts need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| be recommended and they follow a zoning plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Now those who've been involved and you've been studying this and looking at this, does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| that seem to be, Commissioner Norman you were involved in the writing of this, does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| seem to be an accurate portrayal of those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Right, we saw the need for, there's obviously places where there's major roads or highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=817)|
| 0:13:45| that are going through ridge lines and when those intersect, there's opportunities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| commercial development that are already there and we saw those as, that's a reasonable use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| to continue, expand that, you know, have the opportunity for developers to expand those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| as they need to or as, you know, it seems to fit with the economy of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| So we made adjustments in the plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| I'm going to ask Mark Donaldson, I know you're going to have to crawl over people to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| but it's a basic, the question I want to ask is a basic one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| You've got to give Mark credit because I catch him cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I don't prep him for any questions, just whatever crosses my mind, he gets stuck with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| How does that type, just that first question of non-residential now following a planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| development zone and the idea now that the planning zone district should be recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| how does that differ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Is there a difference in the current way we do it and the proposed way you manage it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| I would say there's no difference and the thing to keep in mind is that within the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| hillside and ridgetop protection area, there is currently a very, very, very small percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| of the land that is zoned commercial, non-residential, and there is an even smaller amount of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=899)|
| 0:15:08| that carries a non-residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| So there's literally more zoning in the hillside and ridgetop protection area than there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| land use, planned land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| And the plan allows for the creation of non-residential special districts that meet the recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=922)|
| 0:15:35| criteria that are in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| The plan actually is broader than the current policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| So you're understanding, but I understand that there's actually a broader scope in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| idea of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| That's the last provision that the Planning Commission added to the task force version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| And all of you have this commercial list here, this is what he's talking about, these comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| The other thing I wanted to bring up was that right now in the current plan, I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| East County sector plan was adopted by Council Commission that recommends commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| should be prohibited on hillsides greater than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Can you kind of expand on that a little bit for information's sake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Yeah, the East County sector plan is the most recently adopted sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| And it embedded many of the policies that are proposed in the hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| protection plan, including the proposed geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| And the recommendation was not to amend the land use plan to provide for commercial or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| non-residential land uses above that 15% threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| And that's currently in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| That was adopted a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| In the proposed plans, there is the proposal that commercial building should not be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| on slopes greater than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| However you see, and correct me if I'm wrong, okay, and anyone else who understands this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| better than I do, but there are a couple of exceptions or proposals attached to that across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Commercial uses may extend up to the 25% slope mark with the provision of tree restoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| planning on the cut slope below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| And also then a special district provision, and you can help me expand on this for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| because I didn't quite understand all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| There's a special district provision that allows for building commercial and office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| space on steeper slopes and ridgetops, and here's where I would like kind of some definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| And it's advantageous for employment-centered development with good transportation systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Does that mean it's a logical place that's got good roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Well, you know, big words get me, so I kind of have to push those down, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| And so that is kind of the, what I think kind of the key kind of phrases within that commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| development topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Is that accurate as far as you can understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| And then I'll want to kind of clarify that if there's anything else within that commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| that you want me to clarify or Mark can clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| On the bottom statements, special district provision, who makes that provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| Does the legislative body or MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| That would be an amendment to the land use plan that's contained within each sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| So the way the current process is that MPC considers it, adopts it, and then it's ratified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| But without the elective bodies, it doesn't become?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| It's not operative until the legislative body approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| And Councilman de la Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Maybe Mark can clarify this, but I'm assuming the reason for the difference in commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| is that it generally requires a whole lot more clearing and a whole lot of hard surfaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| that have runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| And if we're going to put that on the hillside, we're going to make big problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| I'm assuming that's one of the reasons we have the limit for commercial, that it tends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| to sprawl out and take up a lot of land base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Well, that's certainly a factor, but it's also non-residential opportunities are closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| tied to the transportation system, and the transportation system runs on the flat land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| generally, unless it's cutting through a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Are you including more than public transportation you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Roads themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| You've got to move a lot of cars in and out of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| There's a distinct correlation between the land use plan and the transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| And so I hear two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| I think Councilman de la Volpe makes a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| You know, you're concerned about hard surface runoff and that attached, but probably as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| much as anything else, you're tying it to good transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| It doesn't make much sense to do building off, you know, off a dirt road somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| And so you're trying to tie those two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Something else kind of jumping out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| You want to kind of clarify with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| So basically at this point, you know, that they try not to build over 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| You should have a land development, you know, zone attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| And if you do that, the East County sector wouldn't even let them do that, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| there and current, and it's allowed with zone development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| The new plan then, if my understanding is right, you can extend the 25% with special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| provision and there's even a special district provision for even steeper slopes or ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| as long as it meets certain standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| And he said that's through MPC that has to be ratified then by the appropriate legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Then that's my understanding of commercial kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Anything else you want to add to that for the body's sake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| Everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Feel pretty good about it and where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| So, basically, what we're talking about at this point is that this would be so far the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| only exception to the fact that nothing under 40 has been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| Would that be safe to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Well, the previous discussion was talking primarily about residential, the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| density factors that we would make as recommendations, and that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| This will be the only exception, where basically, does residential need to be put into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Well, residential is already allowed into the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| I know, but we're talking about a new document here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Are you talking about under special provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Is that what you're referring to, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Well, it wouldn't necessarily have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| Well, it is going to be, because they're all going to be planned, which constitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| further plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| But when we look at, you know, one of the big issues that was facing this plan, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1318)|
| 0:22:07| know, from those against it was the fact that it changed everything from 15 percent up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| When, in effect, it does not, except for this one exception now that we've got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1334)|
| 0:22:24| Yeah, and that exception broadens the flexibility as far as doing commercial activity above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Well, but I'm saying this defines it where we never had this discussion before publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| so that this information could be disseminated out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Okay, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Yes, Commissioner Omby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| I just want to, I guess, point something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| I guess on where it says proposed, it says commercial buildings should not be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| I like that wording because it doesn't mean it can't be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| And I think I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| I think that's an accurate phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| It should not be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| It's not a, it's, I want to make sure that I phrased that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| Is that the correct wording, or should it be stronger wording from the NPC's point of view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| The intent in the plan is to use the should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| We scrubbed it, what we thought thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| We actually found a couple of musts in there, and there's one must that we would love to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| But other than that one, everything else says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| That's been the sticking point on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Some of these has been the must instead of the should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| Everything else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| But if you put must in here, it negates this whole other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| That's why I wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| That's why I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| This is a should as far as the clarity is concerned with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Well, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Let's move on to the ridgetop definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| I've been asked this one multiple times, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| What's the definition of a ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| My understanding is currently there is no written definition of a ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| But in the proposed plan, it's basically the flatter area above a ridge's steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| We'll define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| The flat area above a steep slope is a ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| That seems to be the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Now, the second question I've been asked, I think we need to sort through with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| is why haven't you used, like, rise and elevation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| Or why haven't you used just elevation for ridgetops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| I've heard people say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| I'm just kind of telling what I've heard, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| That this is just pretty broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Why do you just, like, pick an elevation and anything above that elevation is a ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| Or a certain rise and that's a ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Which, you know, seems like a logical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| I'm going to pick on Mark again because, you know, I asked him that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| They gave me an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| But rather than repeat what you said to me, I'm just going to the source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| The task force spent a great amount of time talking about what ridges look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1504)|
| 0:25:13| how you would go about defining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| And the truth is that there is no single type of ridge in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| There are rolling ridges and knife-shaped ridges and tabletop ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| And to try to define it would be extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| Certainly within the proposed hillside and ridgetop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| we have captured the tops of slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| And we call them ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| And the task force started from the point of view of trying to describe those ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1542)|
| 0:25:51| that were worthy of protection and move beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| Started at a point looking at elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| And because of the particular topography of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| discovered that that was a very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| and probably nonproductive way to attack the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| And as an example, there's a ridge in the northeastern part of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| that at the base of the ridge, the base of that ridge is lower than Fort Loudoun Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| So if we used that elevation to be the starting point of ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| we would have essentially all of Knox County covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| And then you would then move into the exercise of going ridge by ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| and determining at what point is the toe of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| And that is the process through which we reached consensus on the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1603)|
| 0:26:52| to adopt the methodology used by the University of Arkansas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| and produce the proposed hillside and ridgetop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| which captures slope and those parcels that drain through that sloped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1621)|
| 0:27:10| I've got a question because I kind of looked that up on the University of Arkansas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| and they had some stuff about ridgetop also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| And this is just for me, if you can help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| They said that, and it could be, Mike, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| that certain types of ridgetops might be in watershed that others aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| Certain things at higher elevation might be better for building things at lower elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Is that, and I'm just trying to clarify, I mean, I don't quite get all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| I don't know if Mike wants to hop into that or what you all want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| but that would help me with clarification a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| Well, in describing the proposed protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| we certainly took all of that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| And in recommending those density and clearing factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| we use factors for those less steep areas of the protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| comparable to what we would use anywhere in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| that has that same sort of land use plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| So we are, in fact, reflecting that on the flat spots within the protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| whether they be at the top of a ridge or in a hanging valley or on a bench that's been established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| you get to do what everybody else outside of the area is doing within that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1703)|
| 0:28:33| within that slope group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| So the methodology acknowledges that and provides the flexibility to be used throughout the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1715)|
| 0:28:47| instead of analyzing each and every individual ridge as it comes up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| Okay, and so that's how I hear that described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| I would love to hear some comments back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Anybody else that wants to hop in, just use your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| We can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Yeah, I was trying to understand what Mark said at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| I gather if a ridge has a big flat spot on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| then the slope or lack of serious slope up there allows you to develop that piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| as long as you can do it consonant with the other criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| One comment I've heard is that this whole process started, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| partly from the visual assault on the ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| and, of course, people point to the water tower up by the Cherokee condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| as maybe a trigger point for starting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| But the question is raised, is every ridge to be treated the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| or are there some ridges that are scenic either because they're higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| because they're more visible from roadways or places where people live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| In other words, are there classes of ridges that have a higher scenic value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| that should have some overlay or protection on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| and others that have a lesser concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Obviously, steep topography causes questions about runoff, erosion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| siltation, all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| But was there any discussion about that part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| There was discussion about the visual and scenic aspects of the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| but I think that moved aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| and was overtaken by concerns about water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| The steepness dictates the results that we're trying to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| This is not a visual protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| It's protection of the hillsides and ridge tops primarily to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| or mitigate the impacts of water moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| I think that might be an important thing, and, Commissioner Ownby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| I'll come back to you, but I want to pursue this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| If anybody else has those questions or comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| because I've heard that also, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Well, this is primarily about visual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| and yet this doesn't seem to be a visual description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| So does anybody else have a question? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I just want to comment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| Being on the task force, we spent a lot of time talking about the visual aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| since the whole thing did get started with the water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| What we saw, though, was it was really difficult to really analyze values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| you know, what somebody values in terms of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| They had a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Yeah, yeah. It was very subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| And so we just shifted to basically say all these ridge lines are valuable in their own way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1888)|
| 0:31:36| and certainly water is the issue that we're trying to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| because of the tremendous damage that's potential if we do unwise development on the ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1902)|
| 0:31:51| And there are certainly recommendations in the plan that speak to aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| You know, there are recommendations about the choice of colors that are used on buildings that are on the ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| There's recommendations about keeping a certain amount of tree cover on the ridge line itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| and there's also recommendations about height, which to a certain degree is aesthetic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| but it also has a lot to do with fire safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| But what I hear you saying is those are discussions about as you develop on the ridgetop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| but in terms of definition of ridgetop, it was not primarily an aesthetic thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| And what I heard Councilman DeVolpe ask is, you know, which is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| And I think Commissioner Norman's response is it became just a matter of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| then you're saying whose taste is involved in what's aesthetic and what's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| so you move more to the protection and water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Anybody on that particular topic as far as aesthetic value of ridgetops, anybody else want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| Is this in relation to that also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Anybody else want to add to that before I go on to Commissioner Ownby's comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Commissioner Ownby, do you want to hop in and comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Yeah, comment on this, and also I want to make a statement because I've got to leave early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| The way I'm understanding this is that the ridgetops are going to be basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| are they going to be done a case-by-case since we're not doing an overlay on the whole county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| We're saying, okay, as somebody wants to develop these, they're going to do a case-by-case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| and look at the slope percentages and if it's just a peak or if they can build or not build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| That's right, and that's, you know, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| that's the beauty of the recommendation of using a planned development district to develop residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| on the slopes and the ridgetops is that you do have the opportunity to look at a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| and to determine on a site-specific basis those areas which make most sense to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| and then we can look to determine where those breaks in the topography are that we might want to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| and leave a few more trees and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Okay, yeah, that was, I mean, I like that that we're going to do a case-by-case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| because I don't like the whole blanket every ridgetop is going to be treated exactly the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| because they're not all exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| And my statement before I have to leave is this is just, I guess, something that's concerned me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| and I've got a bunch of calls about it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| is that we have four different lawyers that are involved in all this process, the NPC, the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| and then the city and the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| I'd like to have an opinion on this process from all four to know what we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| before we can make a decision on where we need to go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| I mean, yes, there's going to be changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| We're going to come up with a compromise, but we need to know the opinions and what we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| to protect the citizens too from lawsuits or anything else that might come down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| And I was going to address this a little bit later, but I can jump into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| I'm sorry, I just wanted to say it before I left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| So let me do this while you're still here, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| because I think from the chamber you had a memo, all of you from the chamber, on their opinion on the legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| We then took that to the legal representatives of the bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| and I don't know if Mr. Swanson wants to address it or Daniel was going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| but I got something back from Joe Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| So would you like to address that real quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| I guess I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| I think generally the lawyers have, in fact, reached agreement with regard to our opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| with regard to the legality of what's being done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| that this is something that is being done in an appropriate lawful process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| despite the objections and the opinion of the memo that you received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| Every process that we follow is subject to some type of criticism, typically due process type criticism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| and you never know whether the correct answer to that question is, yes, we've done it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| or no, we haven't done it correctly, until you go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| and some judge tells you whether that's right or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| And you're not sure then until you go to the next level and the Court of Appeals gives you an opinion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| So despite the fact that we love certitude and we would like to have certitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| I don't think that certitude is going to be available to you with regard to the legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| What we have is, I think, agreement between the county lawyers and the city lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| that an appropriate process has been followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| and that we do not see significant legal issues in what is being proposed, either initially proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| or what we have heard about what is being proposed in terms of potential modifications to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| that would cause us serious concerns about the ability to legally defend that if challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| So I think that may be the best we can do for you, although the county law director, Joe Jarrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| when we get into this issue of we want a legal opinion here and we want to dispute this legal opinion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| and go back and forth and back and forth, lawyers can do that forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| We're really good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| And so county law director Jarrett has asked the MPC lawyer to weigh in on that process as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| because that opinion is important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| But I think the bottom line, which is really what you're looking for, is that we believe that the process followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| and the outcome of that process is a legally defensible product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| And that's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| I'm not that naive to think that nothing will go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| I'm not saying that, that we could be excused from anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| But this process, I mean, let's go back a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| We were told that we could vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| There was no changing it until we voted it down and then we could make changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| The city was told different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| They were told to up or down or you can change it and send it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| May I interrupt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| And I apologize for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| I don't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| But I really don't think the advice was different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| I think it was perhaps viewed differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| But the process is when the Metropolitan Planning Commission, whether it's for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| or whether it's for the city, proposes to us changes in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| When it comes from them, we have to vote it, you have to vote it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| or the city council has to vote it either up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| But that doesn't mean that you're stuck with that product either up or down forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| What that means is if you want a different product than what came from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| you may initiate your own plan that incorporates 98% of that, if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| and just change it 2% or you can change it 98% and just incorporate 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| You can do that, but you've got to go through the process once more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| It doesn't mean that it can't be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| It just means the process that you follow in making it different is a little different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Yeah, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| I'm just saying that the city, because I was at the meeting, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| was told that they could make the change right there on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| and that's not what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| But that's irrelevant at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| We haven't got an opinion from the MPC attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Because he didn't get the memo until apparently last week or this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| and I'm just asking that we get that opinion only from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Mr. Sanders, could you kind of tell me what your plan is to make sure that happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| We're waiting for Mr. Wise from the MPC to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| Steve, if we could get everybody to give their name and affiliation for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Daniel Sanders, Deputy Law Director, Florida Main Street Suite 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| There have been some memos going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| We're waiting for everybody that's interested to weigh in before we come down one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| We've said throughout this whole process, just like Mr. Swanson said, we don't see any red flags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| We believe you should go forward with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| But you will talk to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| You guys will come up with an opinion back to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| so they will be heard from each of the council for each of the three groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| I would defer to the law director on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| I'm not saying that we shouldn't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| I don't want anybody to misread what I'm saying or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| I'm just saying that I want to make sure that we have all of our T's crossed and all of our I's dotted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| and that we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| I've read over Councilman Della Volpe's thing so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| I like what I see with a few minor tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| I know you have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Anything else you'd like to add on this particular topic on ridge stopping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Short footnote, and that is that I think the most recent change that MPC came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| which was to lump 40% and above, takes in that flexibility comment we had last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| That is that no track has a no development flag on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| It may be that the standards are very high if you're on a very high and steep slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| but no property owner can say that he's denied the right to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| If he can do it right, if he follows the right procedures, gets the right engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| So I think we actually reduce the risk of litigation by adding the flexibility in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| And that's work that Mr. Norman and MPC had worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| Is that accurate, the way he described it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| I think that what we tried to do, of course, was it was just another language issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| When you say no development, the intent, you know, when we use this budget aspect, it really wasn't no development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2516)|
| 0:42:05| It just meant that if you had a restricted category right there, which that never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| I mean, you just don't have a parcel that gets isolated in that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| I know, but it's the Toro red flag thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| For sure it is a red flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| So I think that table, when we take up, when the councilmen and commissioners can look at that table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| it's certainly the red flag is no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| And we'll talk about that table in the second half of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Just so I'm going to be sure I heard what I heard when we're talking about these red stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| because this is one of the hot buttons from those against from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| They are going to be taken on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| We're not throwing a big blanket over 65 or 72.5 percent of the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Could you just do a yes or no confirmation of that from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| No, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| I'd say this is just one of the four or five really hot subjects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| and I think that's the one that we need to get out on the table and get aired so that everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| But we did not have a chance to do that at our commission meeting, as we've said several times before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| As Commissioner Olmey said a while ago, there was really no discussion, it was up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| Well, I'm glad we're having it now, and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Next topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| I'm ready to move on, but the other two would be, I'm going to go to protection area size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| I mean, I've had it expressed to me and I've heard from some of you that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| man, just the protection area is so large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Now, I'm going to ask this question again just of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| It seems to me, from my limited understanding, that that protection area is determined by slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| Is that how you got the size, you know, of the protection area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| Slope is a starting point, and then after areas of a certain size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| contiguous areas of a certain size and a certain total change in elevation are grouped together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| then the model looks at other areas that are above those areas so that water would drain through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2664)|
| 0:44:34| That is how we literally capture the ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| So, yes, it is all a function of looking at slopes with our GIS capability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2678)|
| 0:44:46| looking at contiguity of slope groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| and looking at some filters as far as total rise in order to throw out the little ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2690)|
| 0:44:59| And the question I want to ask the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| does the flexibility tied now into slope and into ridgetops mitigate, for you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| any of the concern for the size, or is it still a concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| Is that question clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| In other words, if there's flexibility within that, does it matter as much, or does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Ninety-eight percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Ninety-eight percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| You've got the two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| I've got 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| I think, actually, for Commissioner Brown, 98 is pretty good, you know, but I'm just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Were you using 98 earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| I just thought I thought 98 would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| One other thought, and it may just be, as the phrase Tony used, language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| There may be places in the plan where we need to recognize that this is a should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| or recommended approach that not necessarily applies to every parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| but so that when we get down to the tough decision-making on specific ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| our hands are not tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| And so it may be that it's a phrase or a preface or something that gives that leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| to legislate different than the umbrella, because that was always the fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| the umbrella tied your hands to how you might get down to specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| And, obviously, as a compilation of good practice and good things to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| this is a great document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| But if it's rigid, we start to steer towards maybe an undesirable result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| And I'm going back to your concept of how much land is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| In other words, in general it's good, but specifics matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| Land is all different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Any comments to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| I think when the members have time to read the proposal that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| that MPC and I worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| I think overall what you'll see is the intent is to soften the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2808)|
| 0:46:56| and emphasize the flexibility that's inherent in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| And that's both from the calculations and the tables that are adjusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| and from where we're trying to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| or we're adding a couple of sections that clarify and stress those points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| that it's not a document that is intended to be ordinance directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2838)|
| 0:47:27| or to be like an ordinance would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| It's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| It's guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| And there are places where we didn't stress that enough probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| didn't have quite enough language there to stress that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| And I want to ask Mark one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Mark, I know you've already spoken 12 times, but would you identify yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| What percentage of this is zoned agriculture of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| Do you have any idea what that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Because that's a different animal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| Yeah, let's just review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| And this is in big, broad numbers and probably grossly rounded off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| but roughly 131,000 acres are captured within the proposed hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2890)|
| 0:48:19| and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Of that, more than 60% is within the rural classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| which essentially says that all development will be either agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| or rural residential except for some very specific exceptions for rural commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| and industrial and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| So most of the area is within our rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Most of Knox County, 70% of Knox County is still zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| So most of the proposed geography is still zoned agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| which simply has a one-acre minimum lot size for any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| Then stepping back, if you look at the area as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| roughly two-thirds of it is already developed as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| either in subdivisions or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Two-thirds of the remaining 40%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Two-thirds of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| The whole thing, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| Either in platted subdivisions or parcels less than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| Two acres, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| Parcels less than two acres that have a house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| So that's kind of our definition of rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| So we're really not talking about a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| Well, we've taken a whole lot of that 131,000 acres off of the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| because it's planned for extremely low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| or already developed as low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| or extremely low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| That's just as much for me as anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I understand this is not all new development that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Commissioner Norman, do you want to address that, this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Your light was still on, so I was just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| I didn't want to ignore anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Any questions then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Any questions then now on the size protection area, how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| I'll make sure we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| Finally, the cost implementation, which I've heard on several occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| and this is where I'm going to need some help looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| From what I see, there is not any real straightforward process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| for identifying a generalized identification of cost development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| In other words, I guess my question I may ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| I don't know who I would ask in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| how do you go about deciding the fiscal cost of implementation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| Is there a process you guys use if you're going to do something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Is there somebody who kind of works almost like the GAO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| who looks at what potential costs are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Do you guys have a designated person for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| We would have our finance director that we would ask to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| He would, I'm sure, have his staff look at it on the county side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| and work with Mr. Donaldson and the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| and try to come back to us with an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| And we haven't done that at that point, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| And so I think you could look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| There were some, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| It's important to distinguish when we're talking about the cost of implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| the cost of implementing the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| versus the cost of implementing the proposed regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| that are identified in the plan, and there is a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| To implement the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| will trigger two activities that we already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| One, we'd look at rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| and we recommend planned development districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| We're already doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| And then if a planned development district is the zoning that's completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| we then review the development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| We're already doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| If you look at residential development in Knox County as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| the planned development districts are the district of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| because it's the district that gives the builders the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| to hit the markets that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| Nobody chooses to zone RA in the hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| and nobody chooses to zone R1 in the city on the hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| They choose planned residential development already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| So to implement the plan, which is that new geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| and the recommendations associated with that geography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| there is little or no incremental cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| We're already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Now, as we get into ordinances that codify regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| that's a different ballgame, and that's the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| That's creating regulation, not creating a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| I appreciate you delineating those two out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| because what I hear you say, and I want to clarify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| at this point, the implementation of a plan is no more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| or incrementally more expensive than what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| As you move into step two, there would need to be, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| from the finance director or whomever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| a look at what it costs as you begin to codify or deal with the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| And then as we develop ordinances to implement regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| we would deal directly with the respective engineering departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| of the city and county in creating those ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| Great, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Councilman, I mean, I'm sorry, you all moved around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Well, as far as these two legislative bodies are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| I don't think we could separate those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| because when you go down the line, you know, we can vote it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| but as Councilman Della Volpe pointed out in his article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| there may be some additional training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I mean, we don't know at this point what the training statuses are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| of all of Mark's staff and MPC or county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| or water control or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| But I like what he's got in here that somebody with the smarts is following up on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| So there's where your extra cost is going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| And there's no way probably without doing an inventory of what resources they have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3279)|
| 0:54:47| of these qualified people to be able to predict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| But I think it's definitely got to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Is this a new light here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Yeah, I was just going to say similar to what Mr. Brown said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| and that is that costs in government typically are salaries and the support services they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| And planning and designing work on steep slopes without following up with inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| and the training before that is kind of futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| You've got to make sure it gets done the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| And so those will be bodies, and they will have costs and overheads that come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| And like someone else said, that's what the finance guys are good at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| And, of course, you have a temporal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| Right now nobody's building nothing kind of thing, and so the cost would be kind of low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| But in a peak period, you might have to add a half dozen or so trained inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| to be out there weekly checking on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Those are good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| One of the things to consider is that the bodies, both the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| and Knox County, they have to consider their permitting process for water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| the federal regs, NPDES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| What we've tried to do on the task force is somewhat separate our goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3367)|
| 0:56:16| what we're trying to achieve from some of the things that the stormwater people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| that's really their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| I'd like to remind, in terms of cost, the failure to protect forested hillsides are going to result in some tremendous costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3382)|
| 0:56:34| in terms of potentially from infrastructure, from lack of compliance with federal regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3394)|
| 0:56:44| So to get into that, it's quite an exercise, and it's a good subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3404)|
| 0:56:56| but I'd just like to remind the bodies that the stormwater departments, that's really their domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| and for that to deter us from going ahead because we can't get exact numbers about staff or salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| or things like that that may come, those are really engineering questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| And so what I hear, and that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| Here's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Just a quick follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| Some of these costs are going to be recouped because, and any other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| you know, if you go buy a new car and you want mag wheels and you want dual mufflers and tinted windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| you're going to pay for them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| If a certain person is going to build on this ridge stop, they're going to have to understand you can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| but you're going to have to play by the rules that protect everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| I mean, I see that as a comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| So you say that they're building that ridge stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| They may have certain costs for building on that ridge stop to help recoup the cost of enforcement and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| And so what I hear, in summary, I want to clarify this because it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| I hear Commissioner Brown saying, you know, it is important to know what the costs are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| not against those costs because, you know, we can recoup some of those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| I hear Councilman De La Volpe going, there are going to be costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| I mean, there's people costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| It may go up and down due to demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Tony's point is that some of the federal water quality requirements are going to come either way, with or without a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| They're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| They are part of what people have to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| There are civil penalties and criminal penalties for screwing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| And so then I hear Commissioner Norman saying, yeah, and exactly that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| which is the stormwater people are going to be out there and we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| So I think it's fair to say the implementation of the plan, from what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| the implementation is not expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| It's not going to be expensive on the actual this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| But when you get into the actual enforcement, there may be costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| You may need to lean towards your finance directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| You understand there's stormwater people involved and there can be recoupment of costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| but we're not going to deny that if you don't put enforcement in, then you really don't have a plan that's worth much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| And so you've kind of got those both sides of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Does that sound about right and a fair assessment of what we talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Look at the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| I mean, I think the last two weeks we've talked about it to a great degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| This is – oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| In regard to costs, which we all want to be efficient and keep down, certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| I don't think we need to lose sight of the fact that there's going to be a cost of not doing this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| It may not be directly that the city pays for it directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| but indirectly through private individuals, insurance companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| even the city is going to have to pony up some for damages that result if we don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3599)|
| 1:00:07| So we all want to keep a good balance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| and I'm thinking we can spend a little bit of money on the protection part that's going to save us costs if we don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3610)|
| 1:00:19| Great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| And I would say in the last – since we started July 18th, particularly the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| I think to a great degree you have talked through the issues that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| We've talked about slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| We've talked about clearing and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| We've talked about protection area, implementation of cost, ridgetops, commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| All those are the questions we've been dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| And is there any other comments about that before we move to just kind of the final phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| of introducing some of the kind of creative ideas that have popped up in the last few days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| Your light's still on for a reason there, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| I understand that, but I also didn't want to ignore you and make you feel bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| This is my last night here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| I don't want to make anybody mad at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| I'm infuriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Well, what I think we'll do for just the last few minutes is there's been some creative work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| Here where we are, we're at the point now that we're about to hand this back to the legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| and you do that work way better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| I mean, you've now got this plan, and I'll tell you, this plan has been talked about from what I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3695)|
| 1:01:44| And we've worked through the key concepts of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| We've had people talk about, you know, is this a good plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Is this a bad plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Should we amend this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| And we're now coming to the point that you can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| Ever how your chairs tend to want to manage that, whether in groups or within subdivision or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| you can go back to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I think you guys are at a place now where you can now make some good decisions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3721)|
| 1:02:08| What's really exciting to me is in the last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| and this is when I know that we're moving to some good work within bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| is when people start themselves taking responsibility to be creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| and think of ways that we can make the plan more workable and amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| So I'd like to take a few minutes hearing from a couple of different groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| one on the commission side and then one plan that has been disseminated on the council side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| that says, you know, how can we take this and make this workable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| I'd like to give the floor just for a few minutes to Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| Would you kind of talk about you went to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| and you guys started trying to work to make this plan more usable and a more flexible approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| If you kind of describe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| I think everybody's got a copy of his work here, and I'd like you to take the floor and deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Well, you can, if you guys want to flip through with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| ours has the title Purpose of Proposed Revisions there at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| Rather than go all the way through it, and you can do this and analyze it yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| but certainly one of the problems we did recognize, as we said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| there was some language, like no development in one table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| and we saw that we could really accomplish what we wanted to anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| probably by combining some categories in that first table there that's on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| It's on the third page, and it's page 33 in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| And so there was discussion in that table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Like Councilman De La Volpe was talking about the 20 to 25 percent, I mean 25 to 40 percent slope group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3826)|
| 1:03:56| and some difficulties that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| We ran the numbers on some trying to develop some parcels in that category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| and saw that, well, we might be, you know, 15 percent clearing standards in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| That might make it kind of tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| And so the staffers that did the math on this, and as we talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| we agreed that we don't see 20 percent being an onerous thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| and it would provide with flexibility for the developers to be able to have a little more space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| and a little more consideration in the prospect of grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| That was probably the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| Then its effect is in Table 2 in terms of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| And we just don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| We see that as an example of us offering something a little more flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| And then combined with the other language issues where we're trying to soften, take out the must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3897)|
| 1:05:08| We just think that these are simple, relatively easily done changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3908)|
| 1:05:17| that are pretty easy to understand and see their effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| And so certainly we hope you all will consider those as possible changes to the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3925)|
| 1:05:33| And so in my understanding, kind of reading through this, Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| there's kind of three changes here that jump out at me and clarify others too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| One is on ridge top and the 50 percent proposed no development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| You've allowed room for development even at the 50 percent slope level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| Is that correct also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| So it goes into that budget operation for calculating whether you can develop or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3956)|
| 1:06:04| So just to remove that language that sounds like no development can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| So you talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| You talk about expanding to 20 percent the proposed clearing level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| and taking out the word used, onerous, that kind of language, the musts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| where it sounds like people are being locked down and leave more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| Would that be the gist of what you guys are talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| Did I accurately describe that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| I'd love any kind of comment for that, response to that, questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Commissioner Brown, did you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Well, kind of, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| You asked where we want to go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| And I walked right by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| I said that, then I ignored you, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| That's what I'd like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| I mean, I'd hate to think that we've spent all these hours up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| I know they put three years into it beforehand, but with these two bodies together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| I certainly have gotten a lot clearer understanding of what's going on now than what we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4018)|
| 1:07:06| This is your last night here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| I don't know what our leaders have planned for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| but one question would be, are we still going to try to have city, county mirror each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| which I think, if at all possible, it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| Number two, is it possible that MPC or somebody puts these changes into the document in some form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4044)|
| 1:07:35| that this body can get back together, you know, both bodies together and look at again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| I mean, we're just about going to have to go through it, you know, page by page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| Well, not necessarily page by page, but category by category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| to be sure that we're all in agreement on something before it's going to pass through the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| So when is that going to happen and how are we going to accomplish that fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| And that will be our last point of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| I'll take it back to your chairs after we hear from Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| That's great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| We're catching those kind of on our parking lot up here because we make sure we want to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| Thank you for bringing up some good points, and I don't want to ignore those coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| Any other questions particularly about Mr. Norman's suggestions for kind of more flexibility built into the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4093)|
| 1:08:22| Understand that, feel good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| All right, and then on the other side, Mr. DellaVolpe kind of came from a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| and it's a little more extensive document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| I don't know if you want to read through it, but if you kind of describe it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| your approach and what you were thinking and what you hope to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| Well, I guess I was trying to focus on how much we can bite off and chew at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| And when you look at the tables at the outset and you see that, in a sense, we are regulating 65 to 72 percent of the land mass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4123)|
| 1:08:52| and I realize a lot of these requirements are already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| or are required by federal and state water pollution control laws, so let's not be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| But this document purports to be the umbrella for all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| and I wondered whether we had the oomph and the stamina to get that far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| and I certainly didn't want us to ignore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Let's take the biggest risk factor, the steepest land, and make sure we address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| And I'm not to exclude the other, but the idea was let's look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| And, of course, we talked about flexibility, and some of that is creeping in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| That was the other aspect, because as we spoke about last time, development is both good and bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| The good part is that it creates jobs and homes and economy and taxes that run the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| and we certainly don't want to discourage healthy growth, but we do want to control harmful development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| And so that's kind of the yin and the yang of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| And so on the flexibility side, I was talking about if we could, and maybe this is peeking ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| The last two pages of this document really are sort of specific criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| What do you have to do as a developer and a designer to get something that's going to pass muster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| Because before you plop down your, I don't know, $1 million or $2 million to buy the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| and get going and spend a lot of money on engineers and architects and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| you're going to know whether this is a go or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| And without specifics, and in a world where the only answer is a discretionary yes or no from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4223)|
| 1:10:31| after you're halfway down the pike, you can't make that kind of business judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| So I was saying let's be sure we focus on that aspect, and that's what the last half of the document does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| What are things that are important to consider if you're designing for a steep slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| And I brought out in there that the state general construction permit issued May of 2011 uses 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4247)|
| 1:10:56| I backed it off to 30%, but the number could be picked by someone smarter than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| The idea was if we took the steepest land, what requirements do we have to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| And I had that little table on the first page that basically showed that as you got steeper, you had more requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| One of them was qualified inspections and qualified designers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| We've got to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Writing plans and writing laws that don't self-enforce is kind of futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| It's a nice act, but it doesn't get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| So I wanted us to be looking ahead at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| And, in addition, I think that it comes down to money at some times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| It has been said here by some folks, you know, that basically an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| That's the old saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| And if we get folks to do it right, we won't have to spend a lot more money correcting flooding, siltation in our streams, problems downstream that we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4303)|
| 1:11:52| And so this idea of shouldn't we be looking at bonding of the essential erosion control, the sediment control, features on a development site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4312)|
| 1:12:04| I mean, you can scratch them into the earth and throw a little grass seed, but sometimes the grass don't take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| Sometimes the water overwhelms what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| And keeping those structures safe protects homes from flooding, protects streams from siltation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| And I use an example there of how the city had just spent $5 million just trying to buy a little flood expansion room up along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4338)|
| 1:12:27| But the one thing that we haven't talked about was when this process first started, before I think you were brought on board even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| the question was that no one's really an expert on this panel, and it would be nice to hear from somebody with real, you know, hydrology kind of chops to tell us what's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4355)|
| 1:12:48| and what's not from their perspective, and also maybe a design engineer who works in subdivision work to see what the practical problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4368)|
| 1:12:57| And we've had information slanted and oriented somewhat from the planning side, which is good and healthy, but we ought to hear the other side, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4377)|
| 1:13:06| And so I thought as part of the legislative process we ought to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| I don't know if anyone has the stomach for another meeting, but I'd love to see us have, you know, someone like Dr. Schantz come in and give us a dog and pony, answer some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4390)|
| 1:13:19| and one or two of the developer kind of engineers that say, this doesn't work because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| And we get to hear, if not firsthand, then secondhand what has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| I think our job as legislators is to facilitate healthy development and to avoid destructive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4411)|
| 1:13:39| And I think we're all working towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| I was trying to boil my thoughts down to about three or four pages, I guess, in essence, of information that seemed to stand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4422)|
| 1:13:50| And one of the recommendations in there was to consider possibly having a citizen and technical advisory panel that exists for the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4430)|
| 1:13:59| and looks at what's happening and sees whether this plan is working and whether the ordinances we're adopting need tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| In other words, this is a big enough issue that we should have some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| And I don't know what the best way to do that was, but that was a suggestion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| So that's the thrust of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| Obviously, you can read the point by points about, you know, trying to minimize tree clearing, trying to reduce visibility of the structures on hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4456)|
| 1:14:25| They're laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Some of those come from Sevierville and Gatlinburg that actually has steeper land than we do and so has more of that kind of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| They've actually gone out of their way to codify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| Some of it is information I picked up from talking to people and reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| But, again, it was an attempt to put some concrete ideas out there rather than talking generically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| I think that's enough said about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| You can read the words in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| I know that you kind of had to gloss over a large amount of material, but do you want to respond to some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4491)|
| 1:14:58| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| I did a quick read of Nick's, Councilman Del Lope's proposal today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4501)|
| 1:15:09| and what struck me was most of all is that he really talks about very significant, very important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4509)|
| 1:15:17| There's not anything in there that I would consider or I think the task force would consider isn't important and critical in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4517)|
| 1:15:28| But the problem in the process is that a lot of it, and a lot of it has been a lot of what the councilman is talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4528)|
| 1:15:38| and if we were to, these topics, if we were to take them up and start to go into a process of evaluating those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| I think it would take us back maybe about a year and a half or two years into what the task force did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4546)|
| 1:15:55| I think some of them, especially the more water-specific parts of his proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4555)|
| 1:16:03| these are things that the stormwater departments are going to take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| Our review, our stormwater ordinance review committee, which has city membership on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4568)|
| 1:16:16| these are all issues that they are dealing with, how to address bonding and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| A new advisory board is going to be recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| The county commission just accepted some recommendations for a new advisory board on stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| So, you know, ideally, and I'm kind of scooting over towards Commissioner Brown's question too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4592)|
| 1:16:41| I think ideally for me and for some of the staffers that we've talked about, there's a simplicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4601)|
| 1:16:51| I like our proposals for the fact that they're pretty simple, they're easy to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| I think they get us to the concerns that we've expressed in this facilitated session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4618)|
| 1:17:08| It will allow us to be, from the commission standpoint, if we adopt them, you know, somewhat like they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| then it becomes our, you know, it's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| We've just made our new plan and we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| The plan can become operative, you know, when it goes back to MPC for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| So we hope that, I think that's kind of, there's not one thing that Nick's talking about that's not really, really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4650)|
| 1:17:42| but to go back in and maybe have sessions with hydrologists and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| these are issues that we've thoroughly discussed and have been in consideration in the development of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4668)|
| 1:17:58| Certainly there's times when we get to the ordinance phase, there'll be times to vet those individual considerations out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4678)|
| 1:18:08| and so there's not one thing in there that's not going to be addressed, I think, eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| at least in the process as we get through the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| And so here we sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| So we've worked through this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| We've addressed those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| We've come back with, on one side, saying, you know what, we need to make this document more flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| We need to make this thing where people aren't pushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| They don't feel like their land is being controlled for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| They need to have a way to have flexibility where they can go back to their legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4722)|
| 1:18:53| We want to work that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| And then Nick comes in with, yeah, and at another level there's some real specific things that we want to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| And I hear both sides agreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| The question is, you know, and just that you get to decide is do you want to go back and redo that within this particular document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| Does that become more of the ordinance process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| Are those discussions kind of brought in as we move later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| But those are both very legitimate spots to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| Well, and I wasn't suggesting that all of this be put into the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| I think the vision I was trying to express is that we have to have an overviewing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4762)|
| 1:19:30| an umbrella plan that's flexible enough to allow good old-fashioned engineering to solve problems differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| than were conceived when the plan writers wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| Every piece of land is going to take a little special look, but there's lots of ways to skin a cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| I hate to use euphemisms, but there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| And to shut those doors to make a rigid plan would be a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| And so some of these things are, if we adopt a plan that allows us to get specific criteria for developers and stuff to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4793)|
| 1:20:02| I think we do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| I'm not saying that you necessarily pour these into this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| but I do think it's important for us not to shut down good development as much as it is important for us to prevent bad development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4809)|
| 1:20:17| I think that's the balance we have to strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I think everybody agrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Now, the exciting thing is we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| You're done with me at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| Some of you are going to be really glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| You may not welcome me back to Knoxville after putting up with me for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| Phyllis and I both want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| You have no idea how much of what happens here is actually her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| She just doesn't like to stand up and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| We know she's the brains behind Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Everybody, if you've been with us three minutes, you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| So where we stand is I think we've developed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| We've discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| We've brought it to point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| The point is, as someone said early on, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| We need good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| We need some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| In fact, I think Commissioner Brown said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| I need to know where it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| And I guess my question for you tonight, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Yes, yes, but my question still remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| Are we going to go off to each one of our little hidey holes and work on this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| or are we going to still work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| And what I'm going to do is hand that back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| because as I talked to Commissioner Hammond and to Vice Mayor Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| that becomes a legislative decision, not mine, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| And that's where you guys step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Well, first of all, thank you again for your hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| and all of the things that you've done in coming back and forth from Middle Tennessee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| I also want to thank Lawrence Tullock with the Cornerstone Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| because he was the one that is, you know, paying the expenses and the fees and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| And so they were very gracious to do that, and we owe them a great deal of gratitude for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| I just want to throw out just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| And, again, just throwing them out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| I think that now that we have a couple of suggestions from Councilman Della Volpe and Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| there may be others who have suggestions as well from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| Perhaps we set a deadline for any further comments or suggestions for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| that we get them to our individual offices and distribute it by a September 23rd date, which is a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4936)|
| 1:22:23| That way we can all have the information, any suggestions anyone has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| There's got to be a public vetting of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| There needs to be a public procedure where people can look at the proposals and have comment on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4949)|
| 1:22:37| And so I do think it's vital that the two bodies get back together again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| after we have taken a look at the suggestions that people have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Maybe county commission comes with a suggestion, council has a suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| but we meet together to see what our individual body's suggestions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| or we can meet together and try to hammer that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| It scares me that if we do this that you're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| And so I say that because I think you've done a great job in facilitating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| And so it may be that we might want to bring you back another time or two, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| or we have some type of facilitation where we can do this and do it in a judicious manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| So I just throw that out for the bodies to look at, to see any suggestions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| But we definitely don't want to stop now and just kind of let it go on the shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| I think now is the time where we take these suggestions and we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Yeah, Chairman, I think that on behalf of the council we'd like to thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| You've done a great job and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| And, of course, Lawrence Tullock and the Cornerstone Foundation of Knoxville for underwriting the cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| But originally the council wanted to work jointly with the county commission on a plan that we could move forward together on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5020)|
| 1:23:53| Well, I think what the chairman has said is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| and I like his idea is that we ought to come up with some dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| And what I'd like to do is to poll the council on their comments and their feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| and how they'd like to proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| And then I guess the chairman and I can reconvene here in the next couple of weeks or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| and figure out a plan to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| That sounds great to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| So we're perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| We're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| You know, we'll just talk to the Cornerstone Foundation for how we're going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| and we'll move forward if we can be of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| At this point we're now moving into the more legislative work, and I defer to your expertise in that arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| But happy to facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| If you come back together and you guys do that work and you want to have a facilitator there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| happy to find a way to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Steve, I concur with both Councilman Bailey and Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5083)|
| 1:24:52| I hope that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| I hope you can work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| We'll probably take up a collection or something if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| The others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Moon pies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| We'll be getting a couple of moon pies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| When we started this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| we really started with the notion that we came together to consider a problem that is a common problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| It's not a problem that we can separate between the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| The city is dependent on us doing good, reasonable things with development in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| or we're going to damage our city and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| And so what brought us together is just the realization that this is good for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| and we're going to agree, and we started this with the notion, we're going to agree to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| We're going to agree on what are the things that we need to fix in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| And so I think we've gotten there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| I think we've gotten pointed at some changes that we can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5154)|
| 1:26:03| Therefore, it's a new document for us, for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| and I have high hopes for the city, too, that this will be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| and it will be a good starting point for a change that's long overdue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5174)|
| 1:26:23| Well, that's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| So what I hear you saying is that the chairman will get together in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| You guys are going to do whatever process you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| You'll be polling your people, finding out what the opinions are and what needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| You'll select a date that you'll come back together with the thoughts of the council and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| and come back together to try to forge that final document within a meeting or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| to have some kind of consistency on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| If you feel like you need a facilitator, would like me or someone else, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| and we will then lean on your two chairs to kind of walk us through dates, times, and management of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| Does that sound fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Well, I'm honored you let us be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| I was going to really get back to what the chairman here today said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| is when you were talking about getting comments from the public and other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| are you speaking in terms of having a meeting with a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| or just where somebody submits to a website or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| We could do either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| You know, I personally think we need to have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| You know, I'm looking out here at some of the people that are out here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| I mean, I see people that were very passionate against the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| I see people that were very passionate for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| And I know some people are much better at articulating their thoughts and ideas publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5261)|
| 1:27:49| than they are writing them down, and I think it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| And sometimes you can hear the passion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| and you can hear what's really bugging people more when they're speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| than them just trying to list some comments on a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| And I personally would like to have a public forum so both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| if there's something that we're sort of maybe going in the wrong direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| we can get the people that really want to have more stricter protection of the slope speak out for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| or if we're going or if there's another aspect we need to hear that other people can get up in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| And I'd like to hear what some of the most passionate people feel about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| you know, about where we're at right now too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| So that's why I'd like to have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| I think that, you know, the public process is going to be key to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| once we have developed a plan or a proposal to give them the opportunity to give their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5318)|
| 1:28:45| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| I want to thank you for inviting us into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| I hope it was helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| If you need to continue to be involved, we're happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| You're a phenomenal group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| and you can tell that you really care a lot about the people you represent and this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| We're honored to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5347)|
| 1:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110901hillsideprotection?start=5355)|
