| 0:00:06| We'd like to begin by asking Ms. Pelow to ask the invocation and Mr. Hall to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6)|
| 0:00:14| If you will all stand, please, and let us bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=14)|
| 0:00:20| Our Father, it's good to come before you in the quiet of the evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=20)|
| 0:00:26| and express our gratitude for all the many blessings that we experience in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=26)|

| 0:01:00| and for the many challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| This is a challenging time, and so we call on you more than perhaps at other times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| We know you know the hearts of many whose hearts are heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| and the load they carry is heavy because these are difficult days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| We pray that you'll give us the courage and the wisdom to weather those days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| that we may serve you as you need us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| We pray that you'll be with those who are not so fortunate to be with their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| who serve us in areas of the world where there's much difficulty, much fear, and much pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=96)|
| 0:01:44| We pray that you will give them the comfort so that their families may know that they are comforted by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=104)|
| 0:01:53| We pray that you'll be with us as we deliberate these very important issues before us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=134)|
| 0:02:21| Ms. Mitchell, before you call the roll, we'd like to formally welcome Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=141)|

| 0:02:31| It's a high honor to have somebody that's served in both the State House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| has been a former city official, and has his own bridge named after him around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| So it's hard to beat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| But, Bob, we're very glad to have you, and thank you for being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=160)|

| 0:03:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of February the 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=185)|

| 0:03:21| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Mayor Haslam, I have been asked to request a postponement for item number 11J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| There is apparently some wording that needs to be finalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| and Mr. Wetzel has suggested that a two-week postponement would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=215)|
| 0:03:42| That's the item dealing with the city and Southeastern Glass sub-building, LSC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| down on Jackson Avenue and Broadway, and that was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| Any further discussion on that postponement for two weeks is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=233)|

| 0:04:07| Consent items are 11K and 11L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=247)|

| 0:04:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Real quick on Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| A lot of you all were down a very successful Mardi Gras parade over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| over 500 dogs and their owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| And watchers enjoyed a great day in downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| and all benefited adoption efforts at Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| So, thanks for helping on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Tomorrow, tree planting, the Legacy Tree Fund Initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| which I think a lot of you all know, doing through the Legacy Tree Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| the Legacy Parks Foundation, and Carol Johnson Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Tomorrow at 1030, right where Union meets Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| So, if you can come by for that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| One reminder, a lot of you all know this, the Summit Hill Drive road closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| Summit Hill, right where it comes, is closed for probably just the remainder of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| The 200 block, which is closed, is tentatively planned to be a 30-day closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| and started five days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| So, unfortunately, as you all know, once you start digging under old streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| who knows what you'll find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| But the plan is for the 200 block to be closed for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| and the 100 block, obviously, will be closed for longer after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| One other piece of good news to share with you, we did receive notice yesterday that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| as you all remember, part of the south waterfront plan was a pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| And we received notice that in the omnibus bill that Congressman Duncan recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| and we received a $572,000 grant toward that pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| Obviously, we're waiting on some other things to develop before we know exactly where that's going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| but that obviously will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| And it was part of the overall plan that everybody here worked so hard on to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| so I wanted to pass along that good news that we did receive $572,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| That won't pay for the total cost of that, but obviously will be a good dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| What's the total cost estimated, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| It depends on how you design it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| You can build a bridge to cost anything you'd like it to cost, to be flat out honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| So, we don't know, and that will be obviously something this council will have to help decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| I mean, it's one of those priorities with everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| We could have a wonderful suspended bridge that's the latest in architectural design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| or we could have something that's very functional and there's a pretty good price gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| So, TBD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| I mean, that will be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| But the good news is whatever it's going to cost, we're $572,000 further down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| I think TDOT's estimate for your very, very basic bridge, that type of pedestrian bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| is around $5 million, and, of course, that could vary, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| And the one in the picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| High is the limit, as the mayor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| So, we don't know, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| There's still a lot to be said, but we're very grateful to Congressman Duncan for working that out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| Okay, I think that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Following up on our budget retreat on Monday, Mayor Haslam already knows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| I was in Tuesday in Nashville last week and happened to talk to the state's commissioner of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| and, you know, asked him about state shared revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| And the good news is the state is not going to change that this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| so they'll make it good for us in the upcoming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| One good piece of news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Just an update for folks and an announcement for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| You'll recall last December we talked about the Lonsdale Rec Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| and sort of some ideas of saving money to better meet the needs of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| I'd hoped to get a task force together by early February, missed that by a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| but the first meeting is going to be on Tuesday, March 3rd, which is a week from tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| 6 o'clock at the Lonsdale Rec Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| Pleased to have Councilman Woodall helping a lot on that and got some good ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| and a bunch of folks coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| And we haven't officially formed a task force that we brought back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| We want to sort of wait and see who shows up that we don't know about to decide where to go finally with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| But next Tuesday at 6 o'clock at the Rec Center in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Moving on to Item 8A, which is the election of the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| Let me suggest one thing to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| We can obviously, by Robert's rules, as Mr. Swanson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| the normal procedure would be to nominate someone and then have them voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Mr. Swanson and I discussed that maybe a preferable method would be to have Ms. Mitchell go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| and everyone could just say whether or not they wish to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| It's obviously Council's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I personally think that's an easier way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| But, again, it's Council's desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Right now, Robert's rules of order stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| It would be my desire to, like I said, either go around and have Ms. Mitchell call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| and people could say yes or no, whether they're interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| or to whatever different way Council would propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| That sounds like it might be a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Also, I was wondering about the voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| I think we said before, well, I'm not sure where we ended up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| because some of this discussion had to do with the six-district member selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| But if I understand, maybe we were talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| voting and the person that got the least votes being eliminated and going through another round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| I'm just wondering what happens if you get several people that get one vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| and one person that gets two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Does that mean the person that gets two wins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| You have to have five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| You still have to have five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| I just wanted to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| I guess I'm looking for a sense of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I like your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| I think just asking everybody if they want to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| I would actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| I think Mr. Holquist actually raises an interesting procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| If the policy is, and I'll ask this to the people running the meeting, so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| if the policy is that the lowest vote getters are dropped and there are, as Mr. Holquist said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| seven people get one vote and one gets two, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| my sense would be we vote to suspend the rules and do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| But it would be nice if we could fall into that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| If we should end up in that situation, I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| If the idea is just to drop the lowest and there's lots tied at the lowest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| I think we can fall back and discuss that, whether we want to keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| I'm okay with that if counsel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| There is one person signed up to speak on this, so I did want to let counsel know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| There's one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| I prefer to hear the speaker before we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| No, we will do that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| I'm trying to determine the method that we're going to vote before we do that, if that's okay with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Let me just ask maybe for a vote then on if counsel would like to handle it the way that I suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| Again, that's my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| It's your all's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| But all those in favor of having the process be Ms. Mitchell would call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| People could state whether or not they're in or out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| And then we would eliminate the lowest vote getter unless the vote getter, there are three or four people with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| And then we'll rediscuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| All those in favor of that method, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| The next person signed up to speak is David Buckwalter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=718)|
| 0:12:06| David, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| David Buckwalter, 813 Maplehurst Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| It should be self-evident that the power and advantages of incumbency are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| It also seems like we're in a situation where it's possible, if not likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| that Mayor Haslam will step down to pursue the governorship with full vigor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| and the vice mayor will be taking over as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| So I think you should seriously consider, I'll be disappointed if you do not seriously consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| picking someone who is not interested in running for mayor in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| I know there's at least two people on council who are interested in running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| and it may be that everybody's interested in running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| That wouldn't surprise me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| I think to not do that in some ways gives a huge advantage to one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| and also is a bit of an end run around term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| I think term limits are there to obviously keep one person from staying in office too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| Also, I think term limits serve the value of a level playing field at least every eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| every other election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| And I know you all must have thought of all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| and I don't know what the thinking is or the discussions have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| but it just seems to me that I'd like you to know that at least one citizen is standing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| saying that it feels important to strongly consider picking someone who is willing to declare publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| that they're not interested in running for mayor in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Just for clarification purposes, there is absolutely no circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| in which I would be stepping down under the term of the vice mayor we're considering right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Okay, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| I was going to ask, just for clarity's sake, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| could you explain how a new mayor is elected if the current mayor stops serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| just so everybody understands that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| You're trying to kill me off or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| I'm not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| He's asking for Chrissy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Under the charter, the method to handle the vacancy in the office of mayor would be initially the vice mayor assumes the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=865)|
| 0:14:34| and then at, as I recall, the next regularly scheduled meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| then the members of council select someone to serve in that position, whether it's the vice mayor or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| They elect someone to serve in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| And then following that, depending on the timing involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| if it's a significant period of time before the new mayor is to be elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| a special election is called and a special election is held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| with the person selected by the vice mayor serving only during dependency of that special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| And to be clear, we're electing a vice mayor to serve what period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| Ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Right, until the new council is elected, at which point in time they will elect a new vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Responding to Mr. Buchalter, a former neighbor of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| there are five people here who will not be seeking election for vice mayor come December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| Also, I did a little research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I can't find a single vice mayor in the city's history that has become mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=935)|
| 0:15:46| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| I could only find, I mean, you know, I went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| I don't pretend to be a great historian like Councilman Bucher is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| But the last member of city council that got elected to be mayor was in 1972, Kyle Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=954)|
| 0:16:06| And I would say with all due respect that everybody up here tonight is interested in public service in one form or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=966)|
| 0:16:18| Otherwise, the people here, all nine of us, even though Mr. Bucher was appointed, he, too, has put his name on a ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| have been interested in serving, and that's why we are all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Councilman Bailey, something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Seeing no other lights, I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Remember, yes or no is for you personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| whether you want your name to be considered for vice mayor is what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Councilman Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Councilman Bucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Only if that's not a better choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Was that a yes or a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Very tentative yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| I heard everyone except Mr. Hall and Mr. Bucher being willing to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Now comes, I guess, the awkward moment of you have seven folks who are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| and I don't know if you want to have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| We're obviously at a critical point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Well, I would like to make a comment because this is not a yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| as you notice with hesitancy, because just because it's difficult to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| And I've given it a lot of thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| and the reason that I felt that it might be helpful for me to stay in the situation was basically a lot of the comments Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| Burkoff made, and although some of those comments I believe we found not to be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| I do think that, you know, I love public service, have thoroughly enjoyed this opportunity and experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1084)|
| 0:18:14| would take nothing for it and appreciate the opportunity being given me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| But let's face it, at my age, and it is not something that is likely that I would ever consider running for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1098)|
| 0:18:31| And so I thought if that is something that is concerning someone or is of interest to anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| while I will always continue to be in public service and volunteer in the community and so on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| I will not be a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| And it isn't because I don't cherish that opportunity being before us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| It is because, really, I treasure the leadership of each of the individuals on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| And I do feel and I do hope that a number of the individuals on this council will consider staying in the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1139)|
| 0:19:10| You know, at my age, I'm 72, and it's just not a likely thing that I need to be running for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1150)|
| 0:19:19| I'm ready to turn it over to younger people who have many more years of leadership ahead of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| So I thought if it is helpful for one of us to take this opportunity to work through this interim period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1166)|
| 0:19:36| I would be willing to do that so that it would not in any way ever be a problem for any of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| who I really hope will be available for many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| So I appreciate making that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| I'll try and be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Ten days ago, when we elected the new Sixth District Representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| a lot of us said how we thought there were a lot of great candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| And I just want to say that what we said then, I think, goes 100 times for what's facing us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| I mean, we have nine people who can do this job incredibly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| And I know as I think about who I might vote for and who I might not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| the difference between the top of that list and the bottom is infinitesimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| We're all good at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| We could all do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| And, frankly, we all deserve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| And I almost think we ought to do one round where we each get a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| even the people who don't want it, because we all deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| I guess, seeing no other lights, we're going to go to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| What we're going to do is just go through the roll with a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| If we do end up with a bunch of, you know, a couple of twos and a bunch of ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| then we're going to have to talk about that and where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Are they going to state their name or the person there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Yeah, when you're called by Ms. Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| if you would say who you are voting for, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| who you're voting for when Ms. Mitchell calls your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1253)|

| 0:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| You have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1295)|

| 0:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Mr. Swanson, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| We have a tie among four with two votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| and Councilmember Pelow has one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Under the system we use for the Councilmember position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| you would drop Pelow and vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Bailey and Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| You would drop Bailey and Hultquist and vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| My mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1332)|

| 0:22:53| Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| I have Roddy, Woodhull, Frost with two, Becker with four, and did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1376)|
| 0:23:06| I've got two, two, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Who was the three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Sorry again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| I thought Becker had five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Mr. Schwantz, go ahead and give us your totals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I have Mr. Becker with three and Mr. Frost with two, Mr. Woodhull with two, Ms. Roddy with two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| Well, there's still some votes out there then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Does that add up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Three, four, five, six, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| There's only nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1410)|

| 0:23:32| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Somebody double checks you on the budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| So then by this rules, we would drop out Ms. Pelow, and we're now voting between Roddy, Woodhull, Becker, and Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1432)|

| 0:23:56| Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Okay, now I think I do have the count right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| The count is the exact same, Becker with three, Roddy, Woodhull, and Frost with two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| So by our rules, we're sort of deadlocked at this point in time unless someone would like to propose a change in status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1478)|
| 0:24:48| I guess we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Actually, I think under the rules we've adopted, you would drop Frost, Roddy, and Woodhull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| and vote again with only Mr. Becker being eligible for votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| If you didn't have five votes, you'll have to start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Is that your ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| I don't have any authority to make a ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| I'm just saying that under the rules that I understood that we had adopted, that that's the way I think that it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| I think so, except Mr. Becker won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Much as I kind of like that idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| I think it might make more sense to do another round or two where we're at and see if anything changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| I do think Mr. Becker's suggestion before we started was if there was a bunch of people tied at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| that we would take a step back and discuss that was kind of what we talked about up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1536)|

| 0:26:22| Now we are back where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| We can go through it one more time or we can go to Mr. Swanson's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| I guess what's the will of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| I'll make this easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I'll drop out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Mr. Frost is withdrawing from the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| I guess then we will go back and vote between Roddy, Woodhull, and Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| It would be the chair's ruling unless I get overruled by someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1606)|

| 0:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1653)|

| 0:28:51| It's not easy to vote for yourself even when you think it's the right person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| I know enough of these people well enough that just calling their own name felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| somehow wrong to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1737)|

| 0:31:11| Rick Burnett, Keith Pankey, Brad Denton, Jay Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| Excuse me, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Before we get started, you know, last time we had a very lengthy discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| only to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| I just want, you know, there are people here that are very interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| topic, whether they like these things or they don't like these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| And I'm just wanting to make sure that we're trying to go someplace tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| without come in an hour and a half here saying, never mind, see you in a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Yeah, I guess that's a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Is there any sentiment on anyone to that the best move at this point is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| If there's not, and I think we're ready to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Now, that doesn't mean you can't, at the end, obviously change your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| But right now, I think what Rob's asking, which is very fair, is full intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| right now, let's see if we can figure this out without postponing, pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Is there also anybody out there that's kind of a key player that's asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| I just, it's the same question, but, you know, is anybody asking for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I don't think, we haven't heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I don't know if council offices have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Not that we've heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Mr. Hall, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I'd like to postpone it to January of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| I'm going for January 2012 myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| We're going to go ahead and start then with Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1956)|
| 0:32:44| Mayor, did you say grief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Duane Grieve, number eight Emory Place in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| I'm here representing scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| This is my, I think, 13th time before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| And our position is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| We're in favor of the ordinance as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| And I gave each of the council people a packet of information with our position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| statements, both on the ordinance as well as a potential amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| If there are any amendments, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| I'd like to have the opportunity to come back up and talk on that, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| I'm going to call on Mr. Seymour and or Mr. Bedwell next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| Mr. Mayor, members of council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| I am speaking on behalf of the ordinance with one amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| That amendment was laid in place in front of everybody before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| Ms. Cash used yellow and green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| We used a black backdrop and placed a one-letter or one-sentence amendment in green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| The ordinance that was submitted this afternoon by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| and Mrs. Cash allows up to a 100-square-foot EMC on a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2044)|
| 0:34:17| in a development that is subject to a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| Turkey Creek presently is subject to a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| It has a development directory sign on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| As written, the ordinance would allow a 100-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Mr. Bedwell is handing those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| It is the one on my left, your right, as you face here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| That's what 100 square feet would look like on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| Our amendment would allow up to 400 square feet on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| That is what is on your left, or if you're facing it, your left as you face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2095)|
| 0:35:05| The 100-foot square sign we would not put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| Frankly, it is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| It would not be visible to interstate traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| It would probably be a traffic distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| What we are proposing is the language I have submitted that would allow us to go up 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| To show you what that would look like, we have handed out, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| copies of the poster Mr. Bedwell has here, which shows the sign as it exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| And that is the Turkey Creek development directory sign at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| This is what it would look like at the bottom if our amendment was granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| Same square footage, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Do they all have copies of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| We think the after is a much more attractive sign, one that would direct business to Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2161)|
| 0:36:09| and one that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Our amendment suggests that an EMC of up to 400 square feet be allowed as part of a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2173)|
| 0:36:23| in a development subject to a master signage plan of 100 acres or more that is located on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2183)|
| 0:36:33| Now, you may say this is specific to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| I will admit it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| But there are specific provisions in the existing ordinance that apply to individuals or businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| The city of Knoxville, for one, is exempt from any compliance on EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| So we have one at the city coliseum, civic coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| We have two at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| Downtown is exempt if you meet the development guidelines for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| So we have one at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| I've heard that argued to be historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| The top part is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| But the bottom part, where you have the changing messages, symphony this Thursday and Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| and the shows after that, is not historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| It came with the new theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| The old one had a sign that looks like what's at the BSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| A man on a ladder got up there and put letters on Shane coming or now showing, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| And that existed up into the 70s when the Tennessee was last showing first run movies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| You have the Riviera Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| You have the sports corporation down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| So you have four items on Gay Street, and I think maybe the BSU Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| although it has traveling lights, it does not have a changeable message, would be exempt also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| We are asking that you exempt a unique commercial development from these strictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| and that it be made available to other commercial developments in this city that improve signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| I will not go back and discuss everything I have brought up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| but Turkey Creek has, I submit to you, the best signage of any commercial development in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| And it did this in collaboration with the MPC, the city of Knoxville, and it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| If there are approximately 200 businesses that would be impacted, had Turkey Creek not done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| you would have a couple of hundred pylon signs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| You'd have a forest of pylon signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Turkey Creek prohibited that, and the master signage plan overlay, which it operates under, prohibits that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| It has been a model in signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| We think it is unique that there is a resolution tonight that would direct a study committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| to look at other businesses that might be able to come under this in the wayfinding section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2345)|
| 0:39:14| But we think Turkey Creek is entitled to the exemption the city of Knoxville has given itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| that Gay Street has, that the University of Tennessee has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| And I rest my case there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Mr. Bedwell and I are here to answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| but we're certainly not going to belabor the points we have been over before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| He was first, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| How does that sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| It makes me feel like I need to talk in a deeper voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| I think it means you need to talk shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Yeah, we can all hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| I think that tonight there are a couple amendments being offered around a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2394)|
| 0:40:04| and a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| So I've got a couple questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| You've seen the administration's proposal that would get you up to 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| and this is the 40% of the total signage, which would get you up to an EMC of 174 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2414)|
| 0:40:22| I think somebody who can do math told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Let me make one clarification there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Sorry to confuse you, but that actually is not the administration's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| That came out of our sign review group, and we had some crossed wires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| And so until about two hours ago, we weren't aware that that was sent to you, and we apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| But I do want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| That thing that somebody did would give you a 170 square foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| Does that feel comfortable to you all, or is that still not small enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| And can you say a word about why it's not large enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| One, I think it would get us 160 square feet, but I'm not going to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| He is right, 174.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| All right, 174.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| One, we are contractually obligated to CarMax, Target, and Walmart there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| Again, it's an issue of visibility, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| We are on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| The sign is only visible from Interstate 40, 75, although I think the speed limit out there is 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| If you go 55, you're going to get run over unless you're in the far right lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| It's a matter of visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| If it's not a good-looking, attractive sign that is visible to the traveling motorist, it does not work for Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2500)|
| 0:41:51| and especially on an interstate highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Now, is 400 absolute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| We have shown what 400 square feet would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| but anything really under about 360 feet is probably not effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2524)|
| 0:42:13| How high is your 400 square foot sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| What's the height of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| It is Robert Bedwell, 1321 Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| It is a 50-foot tall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| The EMC side, is that 50 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| The overall height of the sign is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| The EMC is probably 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| I mean, to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Maybe 35, but we haven't measured that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| If it's 400 square feet, it's some dimension this way and some dimension this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| What's the dimension this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| You didn't understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| I thought you were talking about the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| What's the height of that at 400 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| It's approximately 14 by 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2593)|
| 0:43:23| That gives you 420, so it's probably 13 and a half by 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| This is for Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| I was actually out deep West Knox County last night and drove through Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| I realized that some of Turkey Creek is in the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| and some of Turkey Creek is in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Is there a portion of Turkey Creek that is outside the city of Knoxville in the town of Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| So it's immediately city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| When you're on Parkside, you don't ever go into outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| Outside the municipal boundaries of either Knoxville nor Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Now, there are a number of these businesses in Turkey Creek that are obviously in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2654)|
| 0:44:23| Isn't it true that you all could not ask for a sign such as this in the town of Farragut because they wouldn't allow them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2663)|
| 0:44:31| I think you're probably correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| But you can't have a sign like this in the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| but this sign is going to be advertising businesses outside the city of Knoxville, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| It probably will, but they're part of a unified development, which is Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| You have our base sign restrictions, Turkey Creek sign restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| and, of course, you have the city of Knoxville and town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| But under a master signage plan, which is an option available only in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2701)|
| 0:45:11| other than using private covenants, which Turkey Creek has done also, you have those two jurisdictions, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Well, I mean, folks aren't surprised that I still don't like these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| but it just kind of sits with me a little funny that what you can't advertise in one place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| you can come on over to the city of Knoxville and advertise it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| And also I'd like to clearly state that I'm in favor of any city of Knoxville signs coming into the guidelines for the EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2733)|
| 0:45:42| And also, as Mr. Seymour well knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| we can't dictate what the state of Tennessee does with their signs or the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2744)|
| 0:45:53| Ms. Marilyn Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| Thank you, Mr. Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Which would apply only, I guess, to the Thompson Bowling sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| The others, the Convention Center and Coliseum, are both city of Knoxville properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| I think it should apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Marilyn, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Mr. Seymour, you stated that the smaller sign, the hundred square foot sign that's on this illustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| would not be utilized by your client because it would be too small to be seen or be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| And yet it looks to me very similar in size to the permanent sort of conventional signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| that you said you're contractually obligated to keep on this monument, the ones for Walmart, Target, and CarMax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| And obviously those must have some effect and some readability for passersby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| If this EMC were enlarged so that it fit inside the pillars of the monument like your contractual conventional signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2807)|
| 0:46:56| would that be acceptable in terms of providing visibility for your other businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| many of whom I think council members have heard from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| who are concerned that they don't have visibility along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| And this allows a revolving kind of presence for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| In other words, it maintains the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| I think a hundred square feet was sort of a random number, and I can certainly be corrected if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| Maybe it was a random number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| And when the design drawings are spelled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| you see that a hundred square feet is a little bit more narrow than the setting of the posts on this monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| So if it were expanded just a little bit, I don't know if that makes it 120 square feet or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| so that it's similar in size to your contractual conventional signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| would that be helpful in terms of your merchants who are desiring representation on the interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| Robert took my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Are you going to answer that, or do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| No, I was just seeing what you were referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| You go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Is my question clear in terms of size that I'm looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| It was a two-part question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| What you're asking is could we make it work if we took the area between the new Turkey Creek logo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2885)|
| 0:48:14| and the existing panels for the EMC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| Yeah, so that it fits inside the two tan-colored posts that we see in our kind of schematic drawing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2900)|
| 0:48:29| So it's very similar in size to the – it looks like you have four now with the addition of JCPenney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| that you're contractually obligated to have in conventional signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| which it seems must provide some benefit for those four businesses in terms of visibility from the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| and in terms of the size of the type and their logo and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| You know, it's a great question that nobody's asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| I believe denied is first reading anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| We would be happy to entertain that as a motion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| and then we can sit down with Duane, too, and we can draw that up and bring it back to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| and we'll get with our ad people and see how it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| If we say no, then you all will just turn it down at second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| But I'd like to be able to draw it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| and I would like to get it on if that's council's desire to get it on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| so that we could move on with this next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| And I guess I understand the need that the smaller businesses have within that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| to achieve some level of visibility along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| And coming out of beer board tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| all of us on this council recognize that small businesses are uniquely challenged in this economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| and they don't have the wherewithal to have the contractual arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| to be one of the permanent conventional signs on this monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| And if we have a compromise position, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| where we could provide some exposure and some support for small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| but still stay smaller than the digital billboard format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| which is what I see in this other drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| I think that might be a situation that I'd be interested in pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| I have difficulty supporting the digital billboard format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| even with my concern about the small business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| because this council has already prohibited digital billboards within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| I think it's really reversing ourselves in terms of that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| and opening ourselves up for questions from that industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| that I feel like that's a bridge we've already crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| He's already spoken on this, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I think it's an intriguing idea that Councilman Roddy has presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| Mr. Bedwell, the drawing that you handed out, the side-by-side drawing, the comparative drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| if I read it correctly, the lower array, the four-panel fixed sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| is 13 by 11.5 feet for a total of 149.5 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| So if you take the left drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| and you remove the large horizontal 420-square-foot panel, pretend it's gone away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| and you replicate the exact shape and square footage of the lower assembly above it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| it looks like there's plenty of room for that in there, as Councilman Roddy was indicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| That would put it at roughly 150 square feet if those numbers are accurate for the lower assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3110)|
| 0:51:59| So does that, if we said 150 square feet, does that sound reasonable on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3119)|
| 0:52:11| I mean, my tendency is to say no altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| I don't like them, but looking for some compromise will get us moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| I would prefer, from an aesthetic point and from a structural point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| that if we could make that a solid so that it's probably around 200 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| If we went to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Well, that wasn't my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| My question was about 150 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| This is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| We can actually, because it's been considered at 400 square feet, we can still consider bumping it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| if you can make the case for it with your drawings, et cetera, at second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| But I'm proposing that we just go with the square footage of the lower assembly on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| I won't do anything to discourage first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| And we will be happy to provide drawings for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| I think it's an excellent suggestion and something we hadn't thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Vice Mayor Becker, I'll get there after a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Ms. Roddy, actually I was sort of going where Councilman Holquist was about what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| that in effect this does look about the same size as the lower sign on this that's in white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| Is that what you're thinking as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| this idea of what Councilman Holquist said is 150 square feet would get us about there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| That's what you're thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| I think the dimensions on here are approximate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| and we can certainly tinker with that on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| But this shows us in both the left and the right-hand drawing 149.5 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| as being the dimensions of the white panel with the gray horizontal lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| and I believe that's representative of the contractually obligated conventional signs that are on this monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| And so replicate that same 149.5 square feet in a digital billboard format just above it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3246)|
| 0:54:15| that could have rotating displays to allow some presence for some of the smaller business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| And I can present that as a motion if we're ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| If we can hear Councilman Booker's light, then I'll come back if nobody's ready for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Since we're talking about some technicalities and redoing, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| I have a question that's in 9A number 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| and it says a temporary sign shall not be suspended across public streets or other public places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| What kind of signs are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| Does that include banners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Which page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| It's on page 4 of 29 on the ordinance, item number 13 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3294)|
| 0:55:04| That would be a question for Ms. Cash, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| That does include banners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| My goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| What about the Old City, for example, when it has Mardi Gras and it puts a banner across Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3312)|
| 0:55:20| and when Kumba Fest happens, it puts a banner across Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| When the Tennessee Valley A&I Fair comes, I think they have a banner across Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| Are we banning those with this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| That item is already existing in the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| That is already in effect, so we are not proposing any changes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| That language has been in there for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| You just don't enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| If we get a complaint, we do enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Well, I don't think you'll get a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Do we have a motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| We do not have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| There's nothing on the floor at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| There are, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| I will propose an amendment to 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| We need an original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| There's no motion period on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| There's a motion to approve 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Well, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| So I would like to propose an amendment to 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| And Mr. Swanson or Ms. Poplin will have to help me in terms of where this language is inserted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| because I know there are various places where some of this is repeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| But in regards to an electronic message center on a sign as part of a development under a unified master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3411)|
| 0:57:01| I would propose that a sign up to 150 square feet be allowed as part of the unified master sign plan display,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3421)|
| 0:57:14| or the unified master sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| I think under a sign plan you have one big sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| The sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| The development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| That's what I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Up to 150 square feet as a part of the development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| That would be on page 8 of 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Ms. Poplin said that would be on page 8 of 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| And then Councilman Hulk will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| We're discussing now the amendment as just proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Mr. Grieve had stood up and said he wanted a chance to address these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| and I guess just to see what does the president of Scenic Knoxville think about this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| And just as a reminder, we have lots of other speakers sign up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| We still have lots of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Oh, yeah, we have another eight or nine people who haven't spoken yet, just for information purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| No, you, Mr. Becker, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| And we can amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| No, we certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| I just am reminding you that there are folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| Yeah, Mr. Becker would like, I guess, your comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| Vice Mayor Becker, we would certainly like to see the diagram in terms of what they come up with on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3497)|
| 0:58:25| But once again, we have said previously that a sign within an EMC located within this area would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| So whether it's 100 square feet or 149 square feet, I don't think that's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| But we would like to see what they do come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| And there has been a lot of communication between both of us, and I'm sure there will continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| Councilwoman Pillow, I think, is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| I don't think there's an answer to my question or my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| But while agreeing with having the opportunity for the amendment to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3535)|
| 0:59:09| I think for some of us it may be a problem to approve the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3549)|
| 0:59:19| So my concern is that this cannot be separated out, which I had hoped might be what would happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3559)|
| 0:59:28| because I feel that this is a separate issue to some of the remainder of the ordinance in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3568)|
| 0:59:38| And that really concerns me, because I think there might be a tendency for some of us to feel we needed to vote against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| where we would vote for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| We would not vote to approve the ordinance in its entirety for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| So help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| Mr. Swanson, that's where I'm struggling at this point before we go any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3599)|
| 1:00:07| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| I had my attention working on the amendment that was offered, and so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Can you ask the question again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| My concern is that some of us may be inclined to vote or to want to support the amendment as presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3616)|
| 1:00:27| in order to give an opportunity for the reconsideration of the plan that was before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| We may not be inclined to want to support the ordinance in its entirety as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3634)|
| 1:00:43| If we cannot consider the two separately, then we would be inclined to have to defeat something that we support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3643)|
| 1:00:55| because we will be looking at the ordinance in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| This is my problem of the way that we have broken this all into pieces now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| and we've put it back together without being able to support the aspects of the ordinance that we do support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3665)|
| 1:01:14| You're wanting to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| I was so hoping that was how it was going to be presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Procedurally, if you want to vote for the amendment, you can vote for the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| and then you could vote against the ordinance as amended when that vote came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| I mean, if that's what you wanted to do procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Well, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| But then that would also defeat the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3691)|
| 1:01:40| Do you see the dilemma?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| And this is what happens when we have dissected this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| and tried to put it back together in a form where we did not thoroughly work it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3707)|
| 1:01:56| before it became a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| So that just leaves me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| I think that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| And I find that to be a very difficult situation to be placed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| All the other lights went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Councilman Pelo, I think I know where you're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| because I, at several points along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| have thought that since we're going about it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| that the best way to go about this would be to delete this part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| go ahead and put together the rest of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| and pass that part of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| because I think we're pretty much in agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| And I know Councilman Becker, at one point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| asked the MPC to look at some issues, which I don't think he felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| or I didn't see were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| I haven't talked to Mark about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| I'm sure we probably weren't very clear on what we were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| But I like the idea of the concept of a graduated sign plan based on acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| and I thought there was a sense of the council that we might want to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| But I'm prepared to support the amendment because they tend to agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| and this is first reading, and so I'm prepared to vote for the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| and move on and see what the rest of the ordinance looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| and then I'll decide then how I'll vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| But I'm prepared to vote on it as it's presented on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| and considering this is an interstate location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| in the next two weeks we'll move forward and see what we think from then, from that point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Two procedural questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| One for the distinguished lawyers at the head table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| We deal with EMCs in development directory signs in a couple places in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Do we need to amend all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| And can somebody just be clear on where those places are and what we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| I'll tell you what pages they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| It reoccurs four times on page 8, 12, 13, and 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| And this is on the ordinance, the packet we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| That was attached to 9A, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Ms. Roddy, as the maker of the motion, was your intention that all those be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| Yes, that's why I asked Ms. Poplin where all it appeared because I knew there was multiple times where it appeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| And I guess just the other question is, with other speakers signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| whether we want to hear from folks before we vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| I mean, it feels traditionally we have done a good job of waiting to hear everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| This is clearly an important issue and, frankly, I think a great compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| But I don't want somebody who wants to speak on this issue not get a chance on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| The question is, are the speakers here to speak on the amendment or the ordinance as a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| Do they have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Most of the speakers that are signed up, I think, are signed up to speak on the ordinance as a whole from here on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| best I can determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| Can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Are we discussing the language in the yellow or are we discussing the language in the green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| Neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| Neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Ms. Roddy, you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| We're talking about something totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Right now we're on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| So we're only discussing the amendment that would allow a 150-foot EMC as part of a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3933)|
| 1:05:42| under a unified master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| And it's on the attachment 29A, which is a 29-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| The document you're referring to is a 32-page document that came out today, which is a different document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| So are we going to discuss the 32-page document after we discuss the 29-page document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| I don't know that for sure, but I anticipate that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Right now the motion on the floor is 9A as presented in the packet, which is the shorter 8-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| I think the answer is that's the direction we're headed into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| And I apologize, but I threw away the 29-pager when I got the 32-pager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| So I don't have the 29-pager now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| But right now we're on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Mr. Seymour, do you have a copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| I think it would be helpful for you all to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| I printed off the copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4000)|
| 1:06:50| If you could go to a microphone, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| I printed off what was in the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| But then when I received this this afternoon, I assumed this would be what was in the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4017)|
| 1:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Let me, while they're, I'm going to give them a chance to look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| and then we're going to go on with our discussion while we do that, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Ms. Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Well, I guess, you know, I'm going to go back to my concern, which we didn't discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| I would appreciate someone, some folks, you know, kind of joining in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| and I hope you understand what I was trying to state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| Councilman Bailey has stated that he sees the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| You know, I just think this makes it very difficult for some of us who want to deal with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4061)|
| 1:07:49| and within our own sense of what is appropriate for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| And consequently, it puts me in conflict with myself to be able to work through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| because this is something that is new, that has been added, the amendment I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4082)|
| 1:08:10| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| I think it is an excellent compromise, if you want to use that word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| or consideration to be brought to us on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| But I have already voiced my concerns regarding the ordinance in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4099)|
| 1:08:28| Consequently, I would be having to vote not to approve something, of which I do approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| in order to vote on 9A in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| So unless we delete or somehow withdraw this section that involves the master signage plan areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4120)|
| 1:08:52| or Turkey Creek specifically, if you prefer to do it that way, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| we've set up a very conflicting issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| I'm sorry, I just needed to restate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| because I really don't think we ever dealt with whether that is a problem with anyone else or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| I think I understand Councilman Pelo, and I think I have a lot of the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| You know, I'm not so sure that the Turkey Creek portion of this shouldn't be looked at separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4159)|
| 1:09:28| I personally, and it may be a shock to some folks, I don't have a problem with the 400 square foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| I mean, you know, I don't see that it would be that much of a detriment for this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4173)|
| 1:09:42| And I do have some conflicts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| You know, we've got some people with a bowling alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| They have bought one of these signs and had it manufactured and can't put it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| Have been sitting on it for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| And then when you really get down to it, and I know this is probably part of the discussion that's about to come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| you know, in these economic times that we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| there are a lot of small businesses that I've talked to of late that use these signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| and say they get a tremendous increase in their business because of these signs that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| And I think that's something we need to really seriously look at is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| one thing to want to protect the appearance of Knoxville with signage, and I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4223)|
| 1:10:32| we don't want a Pigeon Forge or Cervera when it comes to signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| But, there again, we still have an obligation to give these people that own businesses an opportunity that they can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4237)|
| 1:10:46| their payroll and they can sustain themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| And so I'm real conflicted with the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| I think, you know, Ms. Pilo, I sort of agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| I understand what you're saying, and it feels like there are a couple things to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| One, this is just first reading, so there is a chance on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| I'd like to get it done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| The other possibilities, it sounds like if your concern is about the Master Sign Plan language, it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4274)|
| 1:11:24| It's entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Entirety, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Then I think Mr. Bailey actually suggested the option that it would be to delete the idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4286)|
| 1:11:34| to delete all the language on EMCs in Master Sign Plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| and move that to the committee or the task force that my resolution that 11E sets up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| I would actually think that's a great way to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| But I know from talking to Mr. Bidwell and Mr. Turley that Turkey Creek feels they need to get something done quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4308)|
| 1:11:56| And this feels like a compromise to me that makes a lot of sense because it allows them to get an EFC up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| And I think if we do the task force, it still allows us to say maybe down the road Mr. Hall could be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| It might make sense to have a bigger sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| That's not a decision we can make quickly, and I'm hearing from the Turkey Creek folks they need a quick decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| In a way, I don't disagree with Mr. Hall about a 400 square foot sign might not be that bad there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| Can I just respond to what you said about the word quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| You know, for neither side of this issue, is that term quickly appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4346)|
| 1:12:37| I mean, everyone has been waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| We have the woman who has a sign which was built over a year ago, which she's going to be obligated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4360)|
| 1:12:49| We have a company sitting there that has not been paid for the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| They have had a dilemma for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| And this council, I understand with us needing to move quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| But I think for it to infer that, as we're saying, Turkey Creek has got to move quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| I think they have been extremely patient with us as we have struggled with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| And we have struggled with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| My interest in it is why can this not be pulled out and approved separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| And, Mr. Swanson, I do not know if it is possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| But then it becomes, once again, a part of the entirety if 9A is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4407)|
| 1:13:37| Or is it just so contradictory to 9A in its entirety that it could never become a part of that ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4417)|
| 1:13:49| You're saying pull out the part that deals with the Turkey Creek development and pass it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4429)|
| 1:13:58| That deals with Turkey Creek or master signage plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Because I'm a fan of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Because I feel that is the way to resolve many of these issues for these large developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| So, actually, I'm not necessarily advocating for Turkey Creek as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| but for any of those master signage plans which have been described to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| of which I believe are five in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| It is possible to do that simply by deleting all the rest of the ordinance from this ordinance except those provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4464)|
| 1:14:33| But then you're in a situation where you have to start again with all those other provisions of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| Why can't you do it the other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Can't we just delete the Turkey Creek section, and that's what I'm going to refer to it as, delete that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| and then two weeks from today put that on as a separate thing and vote on it at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| In two weeks I don't think is too long of a period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| I would oppose going to a task force because I can envision that I would be off council before that ever came back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| I think you're absolutely correct about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Ms. Poplin has pointed out to me she has one clarification that needs to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| Just something you need to think about when looking at the EMCs on the master sign directory signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| that there is a total sign calculation that's allowable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| so you need to make sure you're not creating an internal conflict because all the signage is added together on that one portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| So the higher percentage allowed for EMC is a lesser amount of signage as to other things that would be permitted on that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4529)|
| 1:15:36| And I think Anita could point out what the maximum is for that particular sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4536)|
| 1:15:45| Without a variance is what Debbie is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| The total would be 400 feet within that without a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| So just a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| I realize there's a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| You can't obtain a variance under the master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Because they're within 500 feet of the interstate right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| Otherwise, it would be 275 total square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| And you add every part of the sign to get the 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| We'll go to Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| Well, I guess the question is are we going to sever that portion and deal with it separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| I think if we do, the only way to do that practically from my standpoint is to do like Councilman Hall is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| and bring it up, the master signage portion, in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| Sever it out now so that we don't address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| I will say that if we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| I am probably going to introduce another amendment that will prohibit advertising on a master signage sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4605)|
| 1:16:55| a development directory sign for any businesses that are outside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4615)|
| 1:17:05| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| Mr. Swanson, if we wanted to sever the development directory language that I made in the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4628)|
| 1:17:18| but be able to consider it tonight on first reading so that we could get second reading in sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| for the folks that wanted to utilize this technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| could it not be added to the agenda on emergency tonight as a separate item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| By motion you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| By motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Yeah, not emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| Added by motion on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| It's not written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| Boy, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| I think the answer to the question is yes, but I would like to consult with Ms. Poplin on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| So why don't you just give us a couple of minutes to talk about this because this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Anybody else, while they're discussing, want to make a. . . that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| Want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| If not, while they're talking, we could go to some of the other speakers or I'll listen to councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| Would you like to. . . okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| I'm going to go ahead and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| We're going to move into. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Now, these are folks who are, as far as I understand, speaking against the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| And the first is Rick Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| Council, there are one, two, three, four people signed up to speak against our rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4702)|
| 1:18:30| Your rules allow three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| What would you like to see happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Maybe all four to speak, but to keep it as short as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| You have a. . . by council's rules, you have five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| but because there's more than three of you, they're asking that you keep your message as short as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| Rick Burnett, 9010 Candlewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| I spoke with you all two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| And, again, I guess the last part of what I had to say to you all, and do I understand this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| 9A, if it is approved, will ban electronic message centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| And for the small business person, it will not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| Well, actually, Anita, you go ahead and comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| The only new. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Anita, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| The only new electronic message centers that will be allowed under the proposed 9A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| in the H-1 or the D-1 or any other special zone that is created to allow them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4770)|
| 1:19:38| but in any of the existing zones the way it is right now, you would have to be in the H-1 or the D-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| or the Master Sign Plan to have a new EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| So. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| I mean, just to answer your question, I say they're not banned because they are allowed in Master Sign Plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| and new zone districts that we create or new zoning overlays we create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| So I don't think they're banned, but. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| But for the typical business owner, like a Wishbones or a Strike and Spare or somebody like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| if you're not a Turkey Creek or a Westtown Mall or a Knoxville Center, you don't qualify for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| I believe Mr. Frost actually had the minimum square footage that a Master Sign Plan needed at one meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| and it's not very big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| I think you said it's like two lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| Yeah, 25,000 square feet and. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Of a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Three businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| And three businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| So. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Retail space, 25,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| So that would ban the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Pretty much it would eliminate all small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Well, I'm against this, and like I said, you know, we've got ImagePoint going out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| We've got all kinds of businesses in these troubled times going out of business because of the hard economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| And I've got a letter here that was written by Larry Smitto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| He purchased the Strike and Spare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| He closed on the property November the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| and I think everybody knows the story about the sign being bought and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| But this is from Larry Smitto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| It's dated today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| You all have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| I'm going to waste my time reading it verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| But in a nutshell, it says he has three of them in Louisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| He has three of the LEDs in Louisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| He has one in Nashville, one in New Albany, and one on Western Avenue at the Strike and Spare there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4886)|
| 1:21:34| And it goes on to say that, well, these have automatic dimmers to control brightness at night and day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| And he says that the sign on Western Avenue has greatly contributed to the increase in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| in over 40% from the previous owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| And he goes on to say this means more sales taxes for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| And obviously it means more jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| If he's got more people in there, he's creating jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| And he's just asking to do this same thing for the Family Bowl on Parkside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| And if you approve this or pass this, he will not have the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4928)|
| 1:22:16| And as I stated at the last meeting, it's, you know, you don't really have an obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| It's the business owner's right to be able to do whatever means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| If it's new technology, whether it's an LED, whether it's a new phone system, a new computer system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| if it's available to him to use and it's within reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| and it's not affecting the beauty of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| We've got beautiful neighborhoods, dogwood trails and all that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| But business areas are business areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| And they're in business to make money, create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| And by limiting them in this technology that they can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| you're limiting their ability to make their business work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| And I really think it's an obligation of you all to vote no on this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| and go back to option A, which was just to increase the street frontage required from 200 feet to 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4989)|
| 1:23:19| There's not, even at that, there are a very small number of businesses that have 250 foot of road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=4999)|
| 1:23:27| I'd say less than ten percent of the businesses in Knoxville do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| Besides that, they can't afford them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| They're a very expensive item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| But those that can afford them should be able to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| I mean, the city of Knoxville uses them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| You see them all through the city county building directing people how to go where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| to pay their taxes or go to court or whatever they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| And to force somebody to use an old antiquated sign that you have to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| and change by hand when one is available where they can type something in on the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| whether it changes every 15 seconds, every 30 seconds, or every hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| It's ludicrous to prevent them from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| And I would just ask your indulgence and support your business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| instead of stepping on them and pushing them under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| I mean, the technology is available for them to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| There's not very many of them that can afford it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| and not very many of them that qualify for it, even under the existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| But I just ask your indulgence and ask for you all to vote no against 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Keith Pankey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| I think Mr. Frost has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| On the letter here from Mr. Schmidt, I mean, I remember him coming for beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| Let me get a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| It says, we applied for the signed permit for Family Bowl located on Parkside Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| several days before the signed moratorium was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| Were you all given a permit for an EMC before the signed moratorium passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5105)|
| 1:25:12| No, we were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| We went down to apply for it, and I think I've told this story before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| We went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| We got this contract signed on December the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| He closed on the property on November the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| He purchased the property and closed on that property on November the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| The contract for the sign was signed on December the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| But we went down with a sign application on December the 11th, I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| We had the engineer drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| We had the sign application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| We had a site plan that was incorrect because there were some right-of-way issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| or easements that were being taken along Parkside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| And we told them, we told Scott Rinneman that this is not, I mean, this is the only site plan we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| but it is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| It's being revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| And we asked to leave the permit, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| no, come back with it when you have the revised site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| We got that from DeLay & Associates, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| and we brought the application back on the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| But you all didn't have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| We did not have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| And we were told that the application had to have been put in before the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| which we actually went down before the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| Anita, there were two applicants, I think, going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| Mr. Burnett, I just wanted to clarify this because I know a lot of us want to address these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| I think there's two applications that were right around the time that we applied the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| And I think that for those that are here on that, that several of us want to get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| and come to some sort of resolution as soon as we can move this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5226)|
| 1:27:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Next, Keith Pankey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| Keith Pankey, 419 Westbridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| I've been in the sign business for 28 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| and since that time there has been message centers, incandescent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5246)|
| 1:27:33| the old light bulbs that would always burn out and they looked very trashy if they weren't up kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| With LED technology, it is a green power source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| It has given business people airports, all sorts of places that try to move people around and direct people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5264)|
| 1:27:54| LED technology has allowed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| It has very many applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| It can be timed on intervals to do just single colors or full color photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5280)|
| 1:28:11| My daughter's name of her wedding that we had at the convention center proudly displayed her name and her date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5291)|
| 1:28:18| and, you know, that was very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| So the technology is available to some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| I'd like to see it available to everybody as opposed to just picking out people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| or properties that you deem competent to have this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| So I'm opposed to this ordinance, and I would appreciate your vote for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| Brad Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Brad Denton, 6723 Emerton Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| Councilman Hall, I'm one of those small businessmen you were referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| I have five quick service restaurants here in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| I employ about 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Five years ago, I was able to purchase a sign for one of those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| I increased sales 30 percent after the installation of that sign, which required me to hire a couple more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5348)|
| 1:29:17| And when I increased sales 30 percent, I had to buy more goods from other local vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| raw goods from the produce markets and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| I would like to be able to add the sign to some other locations, but with the new restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| and things, I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| That's one thing that I know I can do right now that would increase my sales at my four other locations 30 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5374)|
| 1:29:41| but I don't have the 200-foot road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| You guys are debating on signs that are 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I'm just wanting to sign 18 to 24 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| That's not hurting anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| To be able to add an 18 to 24 square foot sign to one of my restaurants could increase sales 30 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| which is more tax revenue, hiring more employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| and putting more money back into the other local businesses in the area for their goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| And, you know, I would appreciate it if you guys would think about the business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| and be a little more pro-business and don't do anything to restrict us from trying to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| What's your business, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Wishbones and Denton's Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Jan Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5435)|
| 1:30:43| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| Jan Watson, 8532 Richland Colony Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| I don't have too much to add here as to what these guys have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| We're just little voices out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| We really – I go back to my 30-year-old sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| What am I going to do when it dies, when it is no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| and I can't put up anything else that it's dead and gone and it's almost there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5466)|
| 1:31:15| I ask you to vote no on this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| Move forward so we can get a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| It's been going on a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Ben Doden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| May I answer a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| This is for Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| Ms. Cash, in terms of traditional sign technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| although I know all of us have read this many times, I still need to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| This new language does not ban – I'm sorry, I've had a mind freeze –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5501)|
| 1:31:49| replacing a sign that has – what's the stuff where you can bend a little tube?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| Neon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| This doesn't ban neon, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| In terms of a lit sign, this new language still allows a backlit sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| as we're used to seeing, or a neon sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| It doesn't allow the scrolling and the movable images that we see in the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| But in terms of somebody needing to replace, like our last speaker, an older sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| there's still the potential to advertise your business with lights at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| in terms of a backlit display or a neon display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| Yes, ma'am, depending on the zone that you're located in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5548)|

| 1:32:37| I had the last meeting, I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| and a council member asked if it didn't seem like there was too many people against the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| and I'd like members or people in the audience to please stand that also agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| that don't have the opportunity to speak on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| You know, it's not just a few of us out here that would like to see the ordinance put to rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| but, you know, voted no on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| I am with Watch Fire Signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| We're a manufacturer of digital signs for those of you who weren't here when I was here last two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| Manual reader boards are ineffective, outdated, cumbersome to use, have limited space for copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| and there have been reports of property damage and people getting hurt and calling letters, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| damage to vehicles and other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| You know, it's 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Everyone has access to computers, cell phones, GPS navigation systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| New technology is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| It's here to stay, and I'd like to see it stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| A lot of businesses in this community have closed down, and others have had major layoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| Let's give the remaining small business owners an opportunity to survive during this time of economic stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| as Councilmember Hall had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| Small businesses need a cost-effective way to advertise to a growing mobile market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| opposed to other advertising mediums such as newspaper ads, radio, and television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| whose markets are decreasing, be it the cost to get on those markets are increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| EMCs also allow the business owner to advertise on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| which allows a potential customer to come in, make a purchase based on what they saw on that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| I handed out an information packet two weeks ago that I hope everyone has had a chance to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| There are a lot of negative opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| I had heard a couple comments that people don't necessarily like electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| but I'd like for everyone to look at the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| In that packet that I provided, there are two studies that address this issue about traffic safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| They state that there is no conclusive evidence on the correlation of electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5688)|
| 1:34:56| and an increase in accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| If EMCs were unsafe, why would the Department of Transportation place EMCs in construction zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| and over the interstates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| These are the most congested and unsafe areas on our roadways that all of us travel on on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5706)|
| 1:35:14| Another document that I provided was a memorandum on the guidance on changeable message signs published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5714)|
| 1:35:21| by the Department of Transportation in September of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| It states that a changeable message sign is not an intermittent or flashing sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| as long as it holds a static message for at least four seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| The proposed ordinance allows electronic gas price changers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| but does not address time and temperature displays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| Time and temperature displays have been accepted in almost all communities since the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| When you think about it, is a message center displaying sale today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| or open until 10 o'clock any different from the fuel price changing from $1.75 to $1.79| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| or time and temp changing from 50 degrees to 1230?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| I encourage all of you today to make the right choice for the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| and the citizens of the city of Knoxville and vote against the proposed changes to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Please allow myself and other sign professionals the opportunity to work with the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| to write a code that allows regulated EMCs to exist in industrial and commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5777)|
| 1:36:24| Thank you for your time. Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Well, I know I'm talking a lot about this tonight, which is amazing myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| But, you know, one of the things that these individuals have brought up is we're fighting technological advancements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5798)|
| 1:36:49| I mean, you know, I don't think anybody up here uses a rotary dial phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| I know Vice Mayor Jack Sharp has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| He used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| And they still work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| But there are reasons that we don't still have those in our homes and use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5819)|
| 1:37:06| And I think we really need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| I mean, this is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| You know, I talked to some folks up in the Pigeon Forge area about law enforcement officers about these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5831)|
| 1:37:20| You know, do they cause a lot more accidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| I mean, they have them up there with streaming video and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| And, granted, I don't necessarily care for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| But they talk like they don't seem to have an increased volume of accidents and stuff because of these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5849)|
| 1:37:37| And, I mean, you know, we've heard, you know, in the beginning, it's been back months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| but I still remember how dangerous these signs are to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| because they're a distraction to drivers and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| And I think if that was a true statement, up in the Pigeon Forge and Survival area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| they'd just be accident on top of accident because that is a they have a higher demand of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| than we have here in Knoxville anywhere, you know, pretty much throughout the summer on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| And I think this is something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| I've just become really concerned over the last months that we've discussed all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| about what this will do when we ban these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| And, technically, it is a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| There may be exemptions to it, but it's a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| If the gentleman who owns the restaurants that was talking here minutes ago wanted to put one out here on Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5906)|
| 1:38:34| he can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| And so, to him, it's a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| Whether it's a ban to everybody, I'll concede that, yes, there are places that you can put one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5918)|
| 1:38:46| And then, I guess, another question that comes to me is why does the city of Knoxville have these type signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5926)|
| 1:38:55| I mean, if it's okay for the city to have them, which, like I said before, I've stated, I don't really have a problem with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5935)|
| 1:39:04| But the reason is it's so much easier for the city of Knoxville to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| And somebody may come up with another reason for that, but, I mean, they could use a reader board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| They could have somebody run out there and change them things every 15 or 20 minutes if they wanted to announce things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| But that's not a practical thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| You know, so I think we really need to really think about what we're about to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5964)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| Councilor Huckabay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Well, I appreciate my councilor colleague's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| I have to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| I've driven through Pigeon Forge four times, including coming and going over the last five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5982)|
| 1:39:50| something I don't enjoy doing very much anymore, but I had to to get to a retreat in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5990)|
| 1:39:58| And I'm not sure at this point if the city of Pigeon Forge has prohibited new EMCs or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| I know there was a debate on hotel signs and pricing going on up there, and I didn't follow that very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| And that was within the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| But assuming that they don't disallow them, that they continue to allow them for businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| it's already extremely, extremely distracting visually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| Whether it causes accidents or not, they're dominant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| And the more of them you get, the more they compete with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| If every business along that route had an EMC, I mean, it's bad enough as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| but if every one of those businesses had an EMC, basically they're so dominant visually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| that you would essentially see nothing else once you've diverted your eyes from the immediate traffic stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| And the gentleman that owns the restaurants was talking about how he boosted his sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| and that may very well be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| But if every business around him has them, too, I suspect that that advantage would drop away significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| So I think we have to make a decision at some point as to what kind of community we want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6067)|
| 1:41:14| And I think my sense is if we approve this ordinance, then we're taking a huge step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| And the technologies that are coming in the future and the cost of the existing technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| plus technologies that aren't on the table yet, all things are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| These technologies will come down in price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| They'll become more affordable as LED technology gets cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| And then there will come a time probably when people will be able to change the very skins on their buildings, chameleon-like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| It's not that far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| So if we just open the door and say whatever they want to do, they can do, I think we'll regret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6109)|
| 1:41:58| And so I think we're moving in the right direction if we approve this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| I think this is a great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| One of the challenges we've had with this ordinance, as Ms. Pelo pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| is we do a little bit here and a little bit here and we get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| I want to suggest for process point, we go back to Ms. Roddy's amendment and deal with that small issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| And then come back to the bigger question, because I think Mr. Hall, Mr. Horquist raised a lot of great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| I know I'd like to respond to it, but I'd like to deal with the amendment on the floor first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Before we, I guess, call the question, Ms. Pelo, would you like to comment first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| or would you like to go ahead and vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| Now there is, while maybe to Ms. Pelo's earlier concerns, Mr. Swanson suggested we split these two issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6156)|
| 1:42:46| and consider them both on first readings tonight, the master plan issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| and then all the rest of what we're talking about, consider them on first tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| Then when they came up next week, they would be considered on second, but separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| That's just a suggestion Mr. Swanson made, so I throw that out there to address Ms. Pelo's, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| partially address Ms. Pelo's earlier concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| I appreciate you making that comment because I wondered what the outcome had been of his consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Well, I just want to comment, of course, I have the same concerns that Councilman Hollis expressed very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| And I've had those concerns from the get-go because I really am concerned about businesses being able to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6201)|
| 1:43:31| And I want to just make one point that I thought was very important in the original ordinances that we were considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6211)|
| 1:43:43| Councilman Hollis, I want to respectfully disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| We're not saying, hey, just come on, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| There was never that inclination, I don't believe, with a single member of this Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6231)|
| 1:44:00| I believe strongly in regulation, strongly in regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6240)|
| 1:44:07| I believe that this could have been accomplished if we had just been reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| and if we had considered regulation and enforcement, I thought we were on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| Now, that's been a while ago, so maybe that seems like an ancient thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| But to me, that is the crux of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| I have serious concerns on a number of fronts about banning these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| And if I were a business owner, I happen to know Mr. Denton's businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| I happen to be extremely familiar with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| I happen to be actually familiar with that business to the extent I believe one of his businesses is across the street from the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6281)|
| 1:44:48| on Kingston Pike, an area that I travel regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| I have observed the increase in business for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| I was concerned about their ability to survive in that location because I felt that they were just really kind of lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6297)|
| 1:45:06| in a wilderness of other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| Fortunately for him there, the frontage is great enough that he can have this opportunity to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6309)|
| 1:45:16| And I did observe, when he changed his signage, the improvement in his business at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| And just another absolutely probably crazy thought that I want to share with you is that we spent the last week in Panama City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6322)|
| 1:45:30| It's cold, a bit like I was looking for Florida to be, so don't be jealous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| But we thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to be away together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| So we drove about somewhat in the city to do some little errands and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| And I'm very familiar with Panama City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| We've been part owners and a piece of property down there for 20 some odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| There the interesting, because we always drive the trip from here to Panama City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| has been very interesting to observe the advent of the new technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| which has come to all the little towns, not just Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| but all of the small towns on the route that we take from Panama City to Knoxville and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| And it's been very interesting in Panama City because they have approved digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| And I thought, whoops, this is going to be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| You know, we've been talking about this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| We've made a couple of trips down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| So I've been watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| You know, a few went up in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| No new ones this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| No new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| Very costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| The EMC technology, I have noticed, has improved tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| It is not a pigeon forge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| It is a town very much like the town we live in, where people are in business for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| small businesses trying to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| I just want to say that I think sometimes we get really wound up with a lot of fears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| that are just simply nothing but fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| And sometimes the worst thing we do have to fear is fear itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| So I want us to have a little concern and consideration for the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| that are trying to make it in these tough times, to agree with Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| I hate to say that, Steve, but I think I agree on basically everything you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| because I have given a lot of observation and thought to the points that he has made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6441)|
| 1:47:29| And I think we have to take some serious consideration about what is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| to the average homeowner taxpayer if our businesses don't survive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6456)|
| 1:47:44| because economic prosperity is what is allowing us many people to stay in their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6464)|
| 1:47:51| so that their residential taxes are not increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| So I think it's a fiduciary responsibility of ours to give a lot of thought to the very big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6474)|
| 1:48:02| And this is a big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| I love Knoxville as much as anybody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| Grew up in Fairgate when it was country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| And I want to protect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I believe that, as wise as this Council is, we can do that with regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| and we don't have to do it with withdrawing the opportunity for people to use modern technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6498)|
| 1:48:28| So a small little speech for the night, but it's heartfelt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| And I really wanted to speak those words to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| I appreciate that, Ms. Peeble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| And I'd actually say on some level I think we are doing what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| I don't think there's that much difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| I don't consider this a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| I mean, I will jokingly say we ban this except where they're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| We've got to talk now about where they're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| But I wanted to go back to the question on the master sign plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| and ask Mr. Swanson to explain how we can satisfy Ms. Peeble's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| and what we should do about Ms. Roddy's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| I think what we have is, under Robert's Rules of Order, we have a motion to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| And the question would be divided so that the master signage provisions would be considered as one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6556)|
| 1:49:25| The remainder of the ordinance outside of the master signage provisions would be regarded as the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6565)|
| 1:49:34| You would be regarding, certainly, the master signage provisions on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| because of the amendment that extends it to 150 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| And I think there are amendments to come in the remainder that are being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| And so they would both then be on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| and they would come back to you for second reading as separate ordinances at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| So do I need to make a motion to divide the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| Well, right now, I guess the motion on the floor is to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| Is that right where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| That's where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| Okay. I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| So, Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Would this be the appropriate time to make a motion to divide the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| I think we have to deal with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| Well, Mr. Swanson, what do you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| I would think it would be more appropriate to go ahead and deal with the amendment that's currently pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| and then a motion to divide the question would be appropriate after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| You could do it either way, but I think that would be the cleanest way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| So if the amendment passes, then we have an amended 9A, and then we can deal with bifurcating 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| That would be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| And the amendment is the up to 150 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| Okay. Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| We're voting on the amendment that Ms. Roddy proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| I heard one no from Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| Now we're back to the motion as amended, and it can be bifurcated at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| So I would like to make a motion that 9A be divided such that the language dealing with a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6676)|
| 1:51:25| as part of a master sign plan, and it is specifically noted on pages, according to Ms. Poplin, 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| It's referenced in this document, 9A, on pages 8, 12, 13, and 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6691)|
| 1:51:39| that that language be separated or removed from this and be considered a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6699)|
| 1:51:45| Second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Discussion on the motion to separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| Councilman Horquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| I think I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| I think we've got a package that makes sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| and so I'm going to vote for it as a unified package and vote against the motion to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6718)|
| 1:52:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Is there an opportunity, if you vote for it, you can vote, for example, if you like the package as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| that means you liked both A and B or you didn't like both A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| So isn't it the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| After the first time we started working on this, there was a lot of concern about what got adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| and, frankly, a lot of hard work successfully done by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| and inspections department giving us the document we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| I just want to ask those same folks, we're going to bifurcate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| and then make amendments on stuff that we bifurcated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| You all feel good that you're going to be able to figure out what we did again because it's going to be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6772)|
| 1:52:59| You feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| One of the things you had tasked us with doing was some clarifying information about price signs of all varieties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| and I think hopefully that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| I'm worried about what shows up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| But as an addendum to what you just said, that was one of the things you asked us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| which hopefully we have done for this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| The motion is to separate the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| That's what's before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Mr. Swanson, these would become two separate items in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| So we would talk about one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| All those in favor of separating, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| I heard eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| Now we're back to two or, yeah, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| Which one do we want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| It would be easier to consider the smaller one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| The smaller one is the master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| We're discussing the master sign plan as amended by Ms. Roddy's earlier motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| If the vote on this fails, what is the effect, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Are we back to 100 square feet, 400 square feet, or is it dead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6855)|
| 1:54:28| I think it's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Dead meaning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| It means that part of it is deceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| You're voting for this on first reading right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| And so as with any ordinance on first reading, if it's not adopted, then it's not adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6878)|
| 1:54:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| So the effect for the signage proposed would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| You would eliminate all of the provisions that are in there related to master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| I assume a new master sign plan development directory proposal could be brought forth at a later date, again, on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6895)|
| 1:55:03| But for all intents and purposes, what we took out is its own thing, and if it dies, it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| There's no motion right at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Motion to adopt the new ordinance, which does not have a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| but it was the piece that was taken out of 9A, dealing with development directory signs under a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| So let me see if I've got this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| We've talked about so much stuff tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| I've talked way too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| I've used a month's worth of words tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6942)|
| 1:55:50| We're voting on, what, 159 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| 150 square feet would be the maximum for, for lack of a better term, Turkey Creek, a development in a place over 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6954)|
| 1:56:03| Is that what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| With the understanding that it may come back and be amended or the request may be amended on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| Am I correct about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| It can always be amended, I guess, or if it's voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| I think maybe what you're referring to is that both of the groups said we want a little while to study this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| and maybe that was the understanding that there's not necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| neither of the parties is necessarily agreeing tonight that they're happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| They want to reserve comment and would come back next week or two weeks from now and let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| I think that's the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| And if it's defeated tonight, if I understood correctly, if this is what we're getting ready to vote on is defeated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| I could propose something else and bring it up two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| You could, but it might have to go to MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| I'd say MPC's probably looked at what I proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| They've looked at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| What is there left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| That uses another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| Go ahead, Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| Mr. Swanson, since this has been, this is a new item now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7027)|
| 1:57:15| On second reading, would we be able to consider anything greater than 150 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7035)|
| 1:57:20| Sure you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| And then that would be an amendment, and then we'd be back on first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| We wouldn't have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| It seems like we're going to stay on first reading for the duration anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| We wouldn't have to go back to MPC, though, because it's something that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| No, that's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| Still considered part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| MPC considered up to 400 square feet, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| Even though it was a separate ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Mr. Donaldson, did not MPC consider up to 400 square feet for the master signage plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| 420 was the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Then I think we're at least good up to 420 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| But it doesn't matter that this is now a separate ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Councilman Batten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| I'm prepared to support this because Mr. Bedwell and Mr. Seymour said they want to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| And the reason I say that is I think what Turkey Creek has done down there is just such a great example of good signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7092)|
| 1:58:21| And on and on and on, I think it sets the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| It's a starting point for what we're trying to do, go on and on about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7103)|
| 1:58:29| There was this concept that came forward out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| that since some council members didn't think it was appropriate to support a 100-acre development like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7111)|
| 1:58:39| because it gave one development an advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| that the concept of a graduated sign plan with acreage down the line should be something that we should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7124)|
| 1:58:52| Because I think there's communities like Bearden and Fountain City and Chapman Highway and Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| that if we're looking at good signage and getting rid of the eye pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| to have this master sign plan in certain parts where it's appropriate in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| is something that we ought to really try to push forward and make it available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| And so I don't want to prolong this thing to the next council, which it looks like that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| If we don't deal with it, there may be unintended consequences down the road anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| If there's not a compromise, if we don't look at this thing where it's appropriate and where it's inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| where it's scenic and where it's not scenic, you know, we may find ourselves with things we don't want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7168)|
| 1:59:35| I'm prepared to support really the whole ordinance with the exception of where there's a master sign plan as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7175)|
| 1:59:45| So I know Mrs. Pillow has suggested that and others, and way back when we asked the NPC to sort of look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| I don't want to send it back to the NPC and wait two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| Hopefully maybe we could do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| I don't like the idea of a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| We've already had a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| But I would like to open that up at some point for comment by council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7206)|
| 2:00:13| to see if there's some way that we could move forward on some sort of review and recommendation, maybe by the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7213)|
| 2:00:22| and or I'm, as I said earlier, I'm prepared to support this on the first reading and then discuss it in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| And then when we come back, go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| I heard a no from Mr. Booker and Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| Was there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| So I heard seven ayes and two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| Back to 9A as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| Anything else anybody would like to add to that before we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| The original 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| What's the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| What is the amendment now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| Well, 9A as divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| As divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| My fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| 9A as divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| So now we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| We're back on 9A with the master sign place stuff removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| 9A as amputated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| As amputated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| I'd like to offer an amendment that clarifies what we're doing with changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7292)|
| 2:01:39| This is the language that is in green on this handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| While I'm on page 22 or 32, I assume it's on at least two places on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| I see it also on page 14 or 32, and it's possible that there are others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| I know Ms. Cash has worked on this, and I understand Ms. Poplin has worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| I think this is language that clarifies what we intended to do with changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| It allows three items to be put up there with a total square footage of 25 feet for the changeable part of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7326)|
| 2:02:16| and it sets actually a change limit of every 12 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7336)|
| 2:02:26| So I could read that, but I think everybody has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| I'm making that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| Come back with us one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| Let's be real clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| I'm actually amending the language that somebody in the administration proposed on changeable price signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| to do what I think we want it to do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| What we have in the current language does not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7372)|
| 2:02:56| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| I'm on 22 of 32, but it's also on 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| Councilman, well, actually, there's a motion to amend on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| Yeah, well, I've got a question about his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| Why don't you go ahead and ask that question then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| My question is about the motion because I'm not all that familiar with these signs that people have up out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7397)|
| 2:03:24| that change prices and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| Is that what people are using right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7408)|
| 2:03:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| Gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| Gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Some restaurants, hotels, motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| I meant the size and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| We did a survey, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| We went out and did a survey on the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| I think the smallest was three square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| The largest we had was 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| And we developed this proposal based on those regulations, that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7433)|
| 2:04:01| Well, actually, working in the gas business back when I was a kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| it seems like we would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| Some days we would actually change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| This was when you had gas wars and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| We'd change the prices two or three times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| Are we restricting them that they can't do that but once every 12 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| With your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| That's the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| I don't feel strongly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| That was what came in the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| I actually think that's unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| What do they do if gas prices have dropped or went up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| They just leave it or cut the sign off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| I can drop that part out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| I was comfortable with changing every minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| This was something coming from the law department and inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| so I figured I'd go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| But I don't feel strongly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| I think our view would be if you want to place a different number in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| That 12, I'm not sure where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| I would call it a placeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| And if you want to suggest something different, that is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| Mr. King seemed to want to respond, so I would love to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| I was going to say just exactly what the mayor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| Well, you know, five minutes or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| I mean, it's something that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| It's a sign flashing that they're changing the price so fast, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| I mean, my understanding is if we don't change anything in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| I mean, the language on this actually says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 5G herein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| each display of a changeable price line shall not change more than one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| every 12 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| So my understanding is if we just delete that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| the one-minute timeline in section 5G would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| So we don't even need to have this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| So let me suggest the amendment, but not include the 12 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| That's comfortable with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| If it would get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| A yawning second from Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| So we're just voting to amend that way with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| So that takes out the 12-hour provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| Any comment on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| Ms. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Question, Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| It allows three price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| So you can have whether it's, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| you can have a gas station that has three different grades of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| Could you have a store, for sake of example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| that has one price on Wrangler jeans, one price on Levi jeans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| and one price on some other type of jeans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| Yes, you could, except with these regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| you can't change the header of the identifying item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| The item has to stay static like the regular, the premium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| and the diesel does at most gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| or how the motels do it that says per room, per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| That part is not part of the changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| Now I got this late this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| and it's kind of hard to go through all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| In this situation, what's the minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| or the minimum road frontage where the property is addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| where these would be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| 250 linear feet of road frontage where it's addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| Now on page 14 of 32, Section 5D as in Delta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| it says changeable price signs will be limited to three per parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| Parcel indicates a plot of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| I don't think that's what's meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| Isn't what's truly meant three per sign structure or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7670)|
| 2:07:58| Well, you don't have to put it on a sign structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| You can actually put it on a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| The other provision here allows for wall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| It can be on a gas canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| It could be a part of a ground or monument sign, or it could be on a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| Right, but my point is it says three per parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| Parcels is a piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7699)|
| 2:08:25| It tells you how you can have the other section tells you that it can be a part of a ground sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| a part of a monument sign, or a part of a wall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| And then it restricts you to the number you can have total per parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7713)|
| 2:08:38| But if I might, what Mr. Frost is quoting is if you've got a gas station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7718)|
| 2:08:44| that has a sign on two or three fronts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| you could only have one of those being the price change or sign if you had three items of gas, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7728)|
| 2:08:55| Or you could have one on one part, one on another part, and one on a third part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| It's not allowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| It's not unified in one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| It has three per parcel of property are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| Three separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| So, I mean, I'd politely suggest that that needs to be wordsmithed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7756)|
| 2:09:23| I mean, you know, move to amend it to 5D as in delta, page 14 of 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7763)|
| 2:09:30| Changeable price signs will be limited to three per sign structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| You know, I'm certainly ñ I wish I had more time to look at this, but it wasn't available today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7775)|
| 2:09:42| Councilman Frost, if you say three per sign structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| if you're on a corner lot and they both have 250 linear feet, you can have six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7785)|
| 2:09:52| But you're only permitted if you have 250 feet of frontage on where you are addressed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7792)|
| 2:09:59| So even if you are on a corner, you're not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| Your parcel doesn't have two addresses, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| That depends on how it's addressed by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| Yes, there are parcels that have multiple addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| There is a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| That was going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| We're going to ñ we haven't voted on the other amendment yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| We haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| I think Mr. Frost's motion would be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| Actually, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| I think we're probably ready to vote anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| Does everybody understand what the motion on the floor is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| Could you restate that, Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| We're adopting the language on Page 14 of 32 and 22 of 32 in this handout, Section V's A through F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7842)|
| 2:10:55| All of which is in green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| All of which is in green, but we're not doing Section G at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| And then I think Mr. Frost is going to amend that once it's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| Is it for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7869)|
| 2:11:10| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| Mrs. Cash, if this is not added that addresses the price-changing signs, what is the effect on gas stations, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7872)|
| 2:11:22| If this is not in and 9A, what's left of 9A is passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| If you eliminate all this language on Page 14 in green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| Gas stations or any other business that wants to use price-changer signs will not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7895)|
| 2:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| I heard eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Now we're back, I guess, to the motion as amended one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| This is the second, the original part minus the master sign agreement part as amended one time by Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7921)|
| 2:12:11| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| I was going to ask Mr. Frost if he was going to offer that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| I think you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| I'll restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| D as in delta on Page 14 of 32, amended to read, changeable price signs will be limited to three per sign structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7943)|
| 2:12:33| Maybe we should say no more than three per parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7953)|
| 2:12:39| This first reading, you know, maybe I need to get with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| I'll do it on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| I'll do it on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| I'd like to ask Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| I would hate to have to do that and then go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| So, Mr. Swanson, if we were to change the amputated 9A, as Mr. Frost suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7973)|
| 2:12:59| change a little language to say you can have six per parcel or three per sign but not more than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| would that move it back to first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| What you just did moved it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| No, if we do that in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| Oh, in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| I thought you were asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| Now, what would you do in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| Change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Make Mr. Frost's amendment in two weeks rather than now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| That's a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| I don't know how it's not a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| That goes to MPC then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| No, it doesn't go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Just puts it back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| If we were, Mr. Swanson, if we were to amend this now to say you're limited to three per sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| and up to 15 per parcel and we decided to reduce that in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| that would not be a substantial change, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| It would be a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| Any change you make that's not clarification is substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8029)|
| 2:13:58| You're just thinking in terms of what it required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| Well, you could pass it on to urgency if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| You'd love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| Let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| If we amend it to say changeable price signs will be limited to three per sign structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8049)|
| 2:14:17| the intent is that all of the changeable price signs are contiguous with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8057)|
| 2:14:29| I'll second that for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| Explain that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| They're touching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| They're not touching, but I'm not sure about these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8078)|
| 2:14:45| I can't visualize what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| The way it's written, you can have three per parcel of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| You can have, for sake of argument, one on the northern end, one in the middle, one on the southern end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8092)|
| 2:15:00| My intent is instead of dividing them all up, they have to be in one place together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8100)|
| 2:15:08| Gee, that's what I was afraid you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| Could I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Why not add one word in there, Council Member Frost, to say the same sign structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8116)|
| 2:15:28| So how would D as in Delta read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| Ms. Cash, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| Three changeable price signs per sign structure with a maximum of three per parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| and all must be located on the same sign structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8137)|
| 2:15:45| The word parcel is the issue when you try to word smith this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| Because I think if I might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| what we want to get at is something that allows people to have a sign that says regular premium diesel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8151)|
| 2:15:59| And if they have a lot where they have two signs, they can say regular premium diesel on both signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8159)|
| 2:16:05| That's what we want to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| And Mr. Frost is correct that the way it's written doesn't allow that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| because it only allows three, which would be one of those signs, but not both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| And the question becomes, how do you get language that says you can have three of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| regular, diesel, and premium, on more than one sign without allowing people to have 15 of these or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8181)|
| 2:16:29| So I think what he's got works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| But, no, I think Ms. Cash is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| But correct me if I'm wrong, Council Member Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| but I thought you wanted to prevent someone from putting one on this sign and one on the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| and one somewhere else, and you wanted them all three to be located on the same structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| Ms. Cash is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| And that is why I was concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| I can live with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| Which means that if you have more than one signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| If you have more than one sign, you can't do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| Ready to vote on that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| This is Mr. Frost's amendment, which was seconded by Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| I heard eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| Now we're back to that motion as doubly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| We have Mr. Becker's amendment and Mr. Frost's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| And amputated and doubly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| I still think we're still presented with a problem of what does this do to the small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8258)|
| 2:17:45| that would like, you know, like the opportunity to get one of these EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8265)|
| 2:17:53| And no matter what you say about this thing, effectively this is a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8273)|
| 2:17:59| There's exceptions, but effectively it's a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| And I think that, as a government, we should be trying to help businesses every way we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| to stay in business and to keep operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| And I think this, the more I've looked at it, the more I'm pretty much convinced that this does just the opposite effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8293)|
| 2:18:23| It's a deterrent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| You know, these people out here have been fighting for, you know, what can I do to increase my business and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| And this is an option there that we're taking away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| And I have some real concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| Yeah, I think, Councilman Hall, I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| And I actually appreciate that you're talking more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| I'm glad that's a sign of my administration as vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| I'm proud of myself already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| You bring it out in me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| There was an interesting discussion when we first took this up between the vice mayor, who sat in that seat before, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8334)|
| 2:19:02| And I made this proposal that we ban them with exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| And he said, why don't we allow them and ban them in places where they don't belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| And I think that those are two of the exact same points, and it's where I think we all want to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| What we've got here is something that says, and, in effect, I made the decision to propose banning them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8356)|
| 2:19:23| except for where they're allowed, because I think they're going to be allowed in a lot fewer places than they're banned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| that they should be in fewer places than they should not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| So it's easier to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| What concerns me is when you say where they should be, you know, and then some businesses here that spoke tonight, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8373)|
| 2:19:45| you're saying that they shouldn't be one on Magnolia out here, and I think it probably should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8385)|
| 2:19:51| You know, that's where we get into a difference there is, you know, where you're saying they can be, I'm not even sure they even need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8391)|
| 2:20:03| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| And I think that where we've let this is with sort of a vagueness of where they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| Right now, it is a master sign plan, which would, in fact, be the property on Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| could get together with two other property owners and develop a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| We have the provisions in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| Now, we have an ability to change the requirements on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| We also have the provisions for more zone overlays or zones that would allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| And what I think we're trying to get at, what I know I'm trying to get at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| is some real clear thinking about where they should and shouldn't be, not on some blanket place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| that they should be everywhere or they shouldn't be anywhere, but a very specific saying they should be in these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8441)|
| 2:20:47| And the key question you say is, where should they be and where shouldn't they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| And there would be hard thinking done on that, but also that there would be some standards of what they look like where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| Because it's the other thing that comes in all this, each one of these exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| each one of these places that allows them says if they meet the appropriate design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| And I think that's another point that says what we want to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8465)|
| 2:21:08| I think there are plenty of places where these things can be allowed and can be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| But where they're going to be, they're going to have to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| And, again, it's a subjective question, but I think that's the kind of city we want to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| So I think we're moving down exactly the right road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| We've got some questions of those shoulds to work out, and that's why I have the task force that's coming up later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8484)|
| 2:21:30| that we need to talk more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| But I think it's the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| I hate going to Pigeon Forge with a purple passion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| and I hate it because of all that traffic I have to wade through to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| all of that traffic that's attracted by signs along the way that say what's being offered in Pigeon Forge in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8507)|
| 2:21:59| I wish we had some attraction here that those signs could point to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8519)|
| 2:22:06| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8529)|
| 2:22:10| You know, we've had this discussion about fairness, and I think at some point we need to address signs as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8530)|
| 2:22:18| Having said that, I wanted to ask Ms. Cash, how many applications do we have for EMCs currently right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8538)|
| 2:22:26| And the moratorium began when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| The moratorium began December of 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| How many applications do we have on record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| I believe there's two, but we have had a number of inquiries that have chose not to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8559)|
| 2:22:45| because they knew that they could not get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| Well, one thing I think we need to address are these two applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8568)|
| 2:22:52| and maybe need to go back through at some point exactly the technical details of when they were submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| Were they submitted prior to the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8579)|
| 2:23:04| Did they submit them before the moratorium, and did they know about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8584)|
| 2:23:11| In other words, what was their intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| Was it to rush in there after the moratorium, or were they already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| Had they purchased the sign and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| Because I think that's a pretty significant issue that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| And I'd like to, before we vote on the ordinance as a whole, address those two applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8604)|
| 2:23:33| Go ahead, if you'd like to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| I can give you some pretty specific information on one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| The other one I believe Mr. Seymour could probably give you the information on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| I do know that the one for Turkey Creek is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| I do not have all the dates on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| but I have researched the one that Mr. Burnett referred to on two different occasions that I am aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8630)|
| 2:23:57| They did come to our office prior to the moratorium being approved by counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8637)|
| 2:24:03| Their package was incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| The applicant that came from their office chose not to submit their application until they had the correct information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8645)|
| 2:24:16| It is my understanding that even after they did submit their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8656)|
| 2:24:25| it took an on-site visit by Scott Brenneman, who is the sign inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| to help get the accurate information on the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| If my memory serves me well, that was in March after the moratorium was enacted in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8676)|
| 2:24:45| That application is still outstanding as a result of the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| I did want to say that our office had no prior knowledge until it was on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| so we did not know that there was going to be a moratorium voted on either until the agenda came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8697)|
| 2:25:05| There was no rush by anyone to get in there prior to the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| Then the one for Mr. Seymour at Turkey Creek, he could provide you perhaps that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8709)|
| 2:25:16| I think Turkey Creek was in there, and I know Mr. Burnett's was all intent and purposes in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| and then I thought there was one other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8722)|
| 2:25:28| I believe we had a request, but because of the moratorium, they chose not to go ahead and submit their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| Did anyone else, to your knowledge, purchase an EMC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| Not that I have heard, sir, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| Well, what's the best way to address the one, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8741)|
| 2:25:46| Because I'd be in favor of throwing that, allowing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| if we're going to go ahead and, for all intent and purposes, ban the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| Councilman Bailey, I had a call from Mr. Burnett today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| and I made an inquiry for him today of Mr. Swanson's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| And I think Mr. Swanson might prefer to speak for himself than to have me comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| But I think he will tell you what he told me and what I then stated to Mr. Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8772)|
| 2:26:21| I do not see how you can make an individual exception for someone who is similarly situated to everyone in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8781)|
| 2:26:28| You're going to have to treat similarly situated parties the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| And, you know, the exception you could potentially make is where application was pending on a certain date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8794)|
| 2:26:41| but in this case that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| So this particular person, as best I can tell, is similarly situated to virtually everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8803)|
| 2:26:54| So I don't know how you're going to make that exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| without just not adopting the provisions of the code that you're considering now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8819)|
| 2:27:05| And that's Mr. Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| Can I allow him a couple minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| It's your privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| Anita says that we were not diligent about getting out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| but I've got a fax that was sent of a site plan from Scott Brenneman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8835)|
| 2:27:22| It's dated 13108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| I met with him out there, not in March, but in early February, regarding the placement of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8846)|
| 2:27:34| It wasn't an incomplete application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| We had the sign drawn in on the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| You're talking March 08, February 08?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| Right after the March 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| We had been down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| I've got a copy of the contract that was signed on December the 5th of 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| Our representative from Sign Co. went in on December the 11th with a permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8875)|
| 2:28:01| We had all the proper documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| We had a site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| We had an engineer drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| We had a completed application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| We had a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| We were told, well, we informed Scott Brenneman that the site plan we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8892)|
| 2:28:18| which was the entire site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| the only thing it did not have on it were the easements that we're going to be taking right away because of the widening of Parkside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8900)|
| 2:28:30| We were told to bring the application back when we had that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8910)|
| 2:28:37| When was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8917)|
| 2:28:38| That was December the 11th, a week before the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| After?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| Well, the moratorium went into effect on December the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| We went in with a completed sign application on December the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8927)|
| 2:28:52| Asked on the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| Ms. Pelo, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| Well, I was just going to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| I know it's sort of an hour where you want to say, well, just get over it because that's kind of, you know, the feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8941)|
| 2:29:09| I really can't get over this for another reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| The location of this business is just a very unusual situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8953)|
| 2:29:18| and they are really on an island in a rather industrial area just off of a very commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8958)|
| 2:29:27| And it has really disturbed me that we have created a situation that has prevented them from they have a new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8967)|
| 2:29:38| They were prepared to spend some money there and continue to make their business successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| It's a family bowling business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| It happens to be in a very unusual location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| The entire situation is very odd, and I just have a real personal concern for this particular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8991)|
| 2:29:58| But what bothers me so much, as I said earlier, about 9A in its entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| is that there are other businesses with similar needs that are either out there now waiting on us to make up our feeble minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9005)|
| 2:30:14| about what we're going to do so they can get on with their business life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| or there are businesses in the future that are going to want to consider Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| and will absolutely, they'll get over it, and they will not locate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| And, you know, I just don't see the future for Knoxville as being very satisfactory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9030)|
| 2:30:38| if we don't find what I have long called that balance between how we protect our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9038)|
| 2:30:45| and our residential areas and our historic areas, and then the balance of how we do business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| So I think the two complement each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| And I think that the way that I see that we needed to approach this from the get-go was regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9055)|
| 2:31:04| Because with regulation, as I commented to Ms. Councilman Holquist earlier, with regulation we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9064)|
| 2:31:12| We can do exactly what you're saying in regard to where or where not to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9072)|
| 2:31:19| But to allow business to thrive here and to protect the residential taxpayer and bring a balance to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9079)|
| 2:31:29| and a good economic future for this city, this 9A in its entirety really disturbs me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9089)|
| 2:31:37| and that's one reason I wanted to segregate the two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9102)|
| 2:31:43| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| Mr. Swanson, as well-intentioned as the bowling alley was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| if they did not have a permit in hand when the moratorium went into effect, no rights vested, did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9110)|
| 2:32:03| Can I object to a leading question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| I think that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| And what I'm hearing Ms. Pelos say is that there is a class of cases out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9129)|
| 2:32:18| where she is dissatisfied with the Ordinance 9A and its universal application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| suggesting that there needs to be further investigation as to whether 9A ought to be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9144)|
| 2:32:31| so as to allow signs in certain areas that are not where they would not now be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| But that's the way you're going to have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| You're not going to be able to say, you know, that Joe Smith's business can have a sign as a part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9160)|
| 2:32:49| The way you're going to do it is you either vote for or against 9A right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9169)|
| 2:32:56| Yes, I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| And, I mean, as a side note, not to give legal advice, but I don't see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9177)|
| 2:33:03| there's a contract for this sign for this bowling alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| and I do not see how you can enforce a contract, the completion of which would violate the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9187)|
| 2:33:17| Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| Well, I'm going to vote for 9A, support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| I think in terms of economic development and the economic vitality of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| a strong argument can be made that if we're trying to attract high-grade businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9208)|
| 2:33:34| corporate headquarters, even manufacturers that are fairly high-level manufacturers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9214)|
| 2:33:41| the creative class that's touted so much now, they're more likely to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9221)|
| 2:33:46| And I think there's actually a lot of data to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| They're more likely to come to communities that are attractive, that have strong aesthetic values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9228)|
| 2:33:54| that have high quality of life as measured by that and other measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9234)|
| 2:33:59| and less likely to come to communities, perhaps, if you look at the flip side of that concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9239)|
| 2:34:06| that are littered with garish signs that distort the rest of the visual environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9246)|
| 2:34:14| So I think that there's a good argument to be made in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9254)|
| 2:34:20| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9261)|
| 2:34:22| Did you say you've purchased the sign or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9262)|
| 2:34:26| Do you have a contract on one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| Have you paid for the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| Well, I'm a sign provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| They have signed a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9273)|
| 2:34:38| They've paid a deposit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| The sign has been ordered from the manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| And, like I said, we went in with an application before the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9283)|
| 2:34:49| We were told to come back when we had the revised site plan, which we did on December the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9289)|
| 2:34:56| And I did meet with Scott Brenneman solely to determine where the sign could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9296)|
| 2:35:02| and could not be located to make sure it was within ten feet back of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| But everything was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| We had no way of knowing that this moratorium was going to be put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| And we were advised to bring the application back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| If we had known the moratorium was going to be in effect on December the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| we would have had our application filed on the 11th when we went there in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9323)|
| 2:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| And that, in effect, then the city would have been obligated to give us a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9330)|
| 2:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| We're back to the item as amputated and double amended, just so everybody knows where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9340)|
| 2:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9351)|

| 2:35:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| Let's better do a roll call just to make certain here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9360)|

| 2:36:11| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9371)|

| 2:36:15| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| I heard six ayes and three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9379)|
| 2:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| Then it's passed as doubly amended on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9381)|
