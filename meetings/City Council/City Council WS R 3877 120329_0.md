| 0:01:21| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| I'm Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| I'm the Director of Community Development for the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| and I provided you with a handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| and I'd just like to call your attention to the first page of the handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| and it's titled Community Development Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| Community Development Week is a national event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| that encourages cities to highlight community development activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| that are funded with federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| So our department has put together a number of events for the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| and they're scheduled there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Mondays are kickoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| It's a ribbon cutting at Dutch Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| That is a project that was built by Knox Housing Partnership with HOME and NSP funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=119)|
| 0:02:07| On Tuesday, we have our public hearing for the annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| which you'll hear about this evening, and that's at 6 p.m. at the Canceler Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| We'll be taking public comment on the plan at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| On Wednesday, April 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| we're planning a bus tour of community development projects from 8.30 to 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| We hope that all of you can attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Please RSVP to me via e-mail if you're able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| We're going to start at the Three Rivers Market on Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| and we will end there at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| So we'll be going all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| looking at projects that we've completed with community development funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| There are also two activities that day at Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| At 1 o'clock, the banking and finance class is doing a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| and the Youth Academy of Finance was originally funded with Empowerment Zone funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| and so the legacy of that is continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| So we wanted to highlight that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| as well as a presentation for the seniors from Project GRAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| And once again, community development funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| Empowerment Zone funds were used to help the summer institutes for Project GRAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| Then on Thursday, April 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| we're having a community development fair from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| This is an opportunity for our subrecipients and different providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| to come out and have information booths for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| We're going to have food, fun activities for kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| and you're certainly all welcome to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| We're having that at the green space next to Ashley Nicole Playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| It's kind of across the street on Winona from the ball fields at Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| So please keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| This is the workshop on the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=254)|
| 0:04:21| Before I get started, I want to introduce the city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=261)|

| 0:04:51| and she's helping me with the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| I'm checking to see if I missed anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| I introduced her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| They're trying to keep me straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| The purpose of the workshop is to overview of the department goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| programs, and funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| It's to review the proposed annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| It's to give you some highlights of projects that we've completed in the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| We're also going to talk a little bit about the substantial amendment for the current year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| that has to go to HUD at the same time as the annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| and then we'll have a time for questions and answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| The mission of the community development department is to revitalize low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| and moderate income communities and strengthen all city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| We accomplish this mission by working with multiple partners on many programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| with various federal, state, and local funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| Our desired outcomes are safe, sustainable, and vibrant neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| decent, affordable, healthy, and energy-efficient housing, accessible and fair housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| economic opportunities for individuals and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| active public participation through strong neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| and responsive collaborative partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| Our department is organized into several different divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| The disability services and ADA compliance, our fair housing assistance program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| housing rehab and financing programs, economic development, homelessness services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| and grants administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| I know this is a little small, but these are our goals as established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| in the five-year consolidated plan, and some of you remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| but every five years the city has to do a comprehensive five-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| and take in a lot of input and community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| as well as consultation with service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| and from that develop five years' worth of goals for the use of community development funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| So these are our goals on which we base what we do in the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=444)|
| 0:07:35| Federal funds have to be focused on one of the following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| and if you look on the left side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| you can see the federal objectives have to be met by all of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| So either it's to provide decent housing, create a suitable living environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| or create economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| Our funds are limited to serving low- and moderate-income neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| and individuals, taking care of blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| and we do that through all the programs that we implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| Our local goals are homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=490)|

| 0:08:47| and increase the supply of visitable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| Under homelessness, our goals are to increase the supply of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=532)|

| 0:09:00| improve access to permanent supportive housing for persons who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=540)|

| 0:09:10| Under the next category, which is to create a suitable living environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| we focus on neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| And our goals are to mitigate the impact of vacant, blighted, and foreclosed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| eliminate environmental hazards that impede redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=565)|

| 0:09:49| and improve mobility and access to transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| And finally, under creating economic opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| we do that through economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| We increase access to economic opportunities for businesses in low, moderate-income areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| increase access to economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=607)|

| 0:10:17| On the far right, you'll see the priority level for all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Most all of these goals have a high priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| There's a couple that have medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| That doesn't really mean anything as far as how our funds are directed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| but we do direct most of our funds to the high priority level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| We would like to be able to fund all of these things, but as you'll see in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| because of our decreasing federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| we really focus only on primarily housing and neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=643)|
| 0:10:52| Becky, is there a comparable chart that shows the dollars related to those categories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Yeah, you'll see that in the projects in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| The annual action plan details how the city will spend federal grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| These are the grant funds that the city receives specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| community development block grant, home, home investment partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| and emergency solutions grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Our plan is guided by the consolidated plan priorities that we just talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| and HUD regulations, the needs in the target areas of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| leveraging other resources, other city departments, community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| and other funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| We try to be proactive rather than reactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| and we try to be progressive in future thinking in our approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| The next slide, this shows the target areas that were established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| in the consolidated plan in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| I hope that you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| We have four target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Area 1 is East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| Area 2 is the Mechanicsville-Lawnsdale-Beaumont area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=726)|
| 0:12:15| Area 3 is Oakwood-Lincoln Park and a little area across Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| And then Area 4 is in South Knoxville, and it includes Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| These target areas are where we focus most of those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| but it does not preclude us from doing activities in any other location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Our funds do need to be spent within the city, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Here's the revenue, the proposed revenue for the 12-13 year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| and we've received this information from HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| so we're pretty sure that if our plan gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| these are the dollars that we're going to receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| and those are listed under the column that says Proposed Revenue 2012-13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| I left up there the revenue from 10 and 11 just to give you an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| and show you how much our funding is being decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| As you can see, in 2010 we got over $2 million in CDBG from our HUD allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| This year they're proposing $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| That's a $470,000 decrease from two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| We do not have any funds to add to our budget this year from former years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| because of the decreases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| We've done a good job of spending past dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| so we don't have any what's called carryover or reprogrammed funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| We are estimating program income to go up a little bit to $220,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| and some of that is because of the Pinnacle Bank FAHI arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| that you all approved a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| We'll talk about that a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| So our total CDBG for the year beginning 2012, July 1, is $1,781,970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=852)|
| 0:14:24| As far as home, our allocation is $898,723.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| You can see the difference between 2010 and the coming year is $493,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| So once again, those funds have been decreased at the federal level pretty substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=879)|
| 0:14:48| We don't have any carryover once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| We are anticipating more program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| so our total home budget is $1,328,723.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| Our emergency solution grant funding is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| That's the one source of funds that has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| It's up to $146,665.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| So our total budget for federally funded projects is $3,282,358 for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=911)|
| 0:15:21| As you can see, that total budget is down about $1.5 million from two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=921)|
| 0:15:31| Okay, if you would switch over to this page that I provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| it's got a lot of lines on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| This is what we're proposing to spend the money that I just talked about on in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| Does everybody have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| The first group of projects, 1 through 12, are CDBG and home-funded projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| and they're put together because some of the actual projects are funded with two sources of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| The first one is the Commercial Facade Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| I know many of you are aware of that program and what the benefits are to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| It is a loan program for exterior improvements to commercial buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| to promote economic development in redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| and other low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| We are proposing $100,000 for the Facade Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| The second project is Property Acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| This is the acquisition of blighted properties to use as housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| We dispose of those through our Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| and this is focused on redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| For both the Facade and the Property Acquisition projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| we request capital funds for those as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| but all you're seeing right now is the federally-funded portion of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| Project number three is Owner-Occupied Rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| That's the largest one activity that we do within our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| It's funded with both CDBG and home funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| and that is rehabilitation of single-family homes for low-income, moderate-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| low- and moderate-income homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| We do full rehabs to bring the houses up to standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| There are times when we actually tear the house down and rebuild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| if it's too costly to rehab the existing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| That's a large portion of the work that we do in community development is for that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| and you can see it's funded with CDBG and home to almost a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1067)|
| 0:17:57| CAC is one of our subrecipients, and we provide funds to them for emergency home repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| They do emergency repairs not to exceed $5,000 to take care of structural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| or system failures for low- and moderate-income homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| We provide funds to Neighborhood Housing to do minor repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| They do most of the work with volunteers, and our funds are for materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| They do this through their Operation Backyard program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| Our funds go to pay for supplies, and then they have young people, students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| primarily doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| Disability Resource Center, we have a ramps and rails program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Our funds help build ramps for low- and moderate-income folks who need accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| in and out of their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| We fund the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| They provide technical assistance and design assistance to community organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| and nonprofits, churches, things like that, for design work at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1141)|
| 0:19:11| We provide down payment assistance for our CHOTOs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| and those are community housing development organizations that develop affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| And for their homeownership program, we provide down payment assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| so that they can help get low-income families into their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| We also provide development funds for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| And as you can see, this is $380,000 for the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| and that is for the CHOTOs to build affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| And we have several CHOTOs in Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| Neighborhood Housing is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Knox Housing Partnership is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| CAC has just formed one called CAN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| And East Tennessee Housing Development Corporation is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| They're building two houses right now in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| So those are all the CDBG and HOME funded actual projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| The next three lines are the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| This is the money that our department receives to operate all these things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| This pays for staff and the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| And the CDBG admin is capped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| It's capped at 20% of what we receive plus our program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| We're able to fund project delivery costs with CDBG, so you see that other $505,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| That pays for the staff that actually works on the housing projects in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| And then the HOME administration, that's capped at 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| and that pays just for a couple of folks who run the HOME program in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| So are there any questions on those projects right now, the CDBG and HOME,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| before we move to emergency solutions grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| I have one question about the emergency HOME repairs, number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| If a low-income person applies for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| how long does it take for that process to work before they actually would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| CAC has a very long waiting list, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| I, at this point, can't say for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| Calvin, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| He says it's been almost a year sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Yeah, we try to refer folks to neighborhood housing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| If they have a real emergency, neighborhood housing seems to be able to get to it more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1303)|
| 0:21:52| Yeah, I'd like to ask, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| I was referring back to the sixth slide you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| which were sort of the five or six categories of activity, housing and rental housings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| You've got all the housing and facade things lumped together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Is there a comparable chart that takes your five priority categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| and puts the dollars in that or not really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| In other words, you have homeownership, rental housing, homelessness, neighborhood stabilization, economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| But this just divides it up between the CDBG and HOME in the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Well, if you look at the facade, the facade funds would go basically under economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1350)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Everything else is homeownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Well, neighborhood stabilization is property acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| But, I mean, it's kind of hard to categorize it in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| because doing homeowner-occupied rehabs is also neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1368)|
| 0:22:57| Commercial facades is neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| So it's hard to separate how much funds are spent on these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| These goals kind of cover everything that we do, and it's very interrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| So all dollars sort of point to the chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| I mean, if we had a project that was to develop a rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| say we can isolate those dollars and say X amount of money was spent on this rental project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| or X amount of money was spent on this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| They do accomplish the goal of neighborhood stabilization as well, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Moving on to emergency solutions grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| We do take applications for those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| And, you know, we advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| We sent out the applications to all the homeless providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| We received those and graded those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| And I did have the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| We received well over the amount of money we have, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| I don't know where that paper is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| But we have $146,000 to disperse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| We received probably, well, close to $300,000 in requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| So we have to evaluate each proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Not one entity that asked for funding got full funding for what they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| So we try to meet the goals of the emergency solutions grant program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| and provide funds to support their services the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| Homeward Bound through CAC is the first project on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| And they provide direct service to the utility company or to a landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| to help folks either get into housing or prevent homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| It's a very successful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| It used a lot of the ARRA money, the homelessness prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| and rapid rehousing funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| and it serves a large number of people right now to prevent homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| and get them back into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| So we're funding them at $41,000, $466,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| Legal Aid of East Tennessee provides legal assistance to homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| to help them access what they need to get into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| whether it's a driver's license or a birth certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| or the paperwork they need, whatever they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| to get them in the position of securing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Volunteer Ministry Center, we are funding the day resource center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| We provide staffing and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| and also some case management dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| We're funding them at $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| The YWCA provides transitional shelter residence for women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| and we have funded them for quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| We are providing funds for case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| and some of their utility and maintenance costs, $9,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Family Promise is a new applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| You might have seen a write-up in the focus paper about that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| They provide case management and educational and training assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| to prevent homelessness, and we're funding them at $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Catholic Charities, we're funding Samaritan Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| which is transitional housing for senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| We're actually funding maintenance and replacement of some of their bedding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| They're mattresses and beds for hygiene purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| and we're funding them at $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| And then the University of Tennessee manages the HMIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Homeless Management Information System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| We are able to fund that with emergency solutions grants now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| and they coordinate all the providers to use the Internet communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| so that homeless services can be tracked throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| And then we have a small amount of administration that we're allowed to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| to help us operate our programs through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Each one of these programs requires that a staff person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| we have a contract with these entities, we have to approve all their invoices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| we have to monitor them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| So even though the amount of money that's funded for these organizations is fairly small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| it's labor intensive on our part with our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| because we have to monitor and track how all these funds are spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| and report that to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| So are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| The next steps, the annual action plan was posted on our website March the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| The public hearing for this plan is April the 10th, 6 p.m. at the Counselor Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| We will receive public comment through April 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| and then we will bring this to Council on April 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| The plan is due to HUD on May the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Next I'm just going to let you see some of the highlights of the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| of some of the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| This is the Owner-Occupied Rehab Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| On the top you'll see a house at 2458 Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| The before is on the left and the after is on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| On the bottom you'll see the interior of a house at 2601 Linden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| the living room before and after, and the kitchen before and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1748)|
| 0:29:15| So you can see that we make a great improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Here are some examples of replacement homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| These are where the cost to do rehab on these homes was so expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| that it was more economical for us to replace the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| So this one at 2110 Branner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| You can see the before on the left and the after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| And at 3603 Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| The before is on the left and the after is on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| These are some examples of My Front Yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Now we don't have any funds for the coming year for the My Front Yard Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| but we will be funding it with program income that we're getting back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| from our Empowerment Zone, some of our Empowerment Zone funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| So we will try to continue this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| My Front Yard is a residential façade program up to $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| that's basically a grant to the homeowner to do exterior improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| And once again, this not only helps stabilize their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| but it stabilizes the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| See the one at 1021 Catherine on the left, before and then after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| That's a question right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| What was the budget this year for My Front Yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| We had, do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| It was ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Last time we funded it was 2010, and we are still working on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| some of those right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| How much was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| It was $200,000 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| And that was just an outright grant, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| There's certain things that the homeowner has to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Their taxes have to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| Their mortgage has to be current, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| But it's a deferred payment, so it drops off so much over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| And if they turn around and sell it year two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| then we would recoup some of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Remember some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Go back to the slide before that on the replacement homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| I'm just not real familiar how that exactly, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| Did you all do that through Chideau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| We did that in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| The homeowner has a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| We help the homeowner select a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| The projects bid through a bid process like the city uses for procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| And we help the homeowner pick a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| The contractor builds the house for the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| and we oversee the work and make sure that it meets city standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| And, of course, it's inspected by the city inspections and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| And, of course, the funds for this, most all of this is a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| So the homeowner pays us back over 20 years for this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| Like at zero interest or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| It's 1% or 3% depending on their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Is that the money that you run through Pinnacle or is that a different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| Well, it's the same concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| We will be doing that starting July 1st is the loans that they buy, that FAHI buys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| So you still have the piece of cash to work another home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Right now we collect the loans over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| We service them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| For people watching at home, when you talk about your front yard or my front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| you're not talking about your personal front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| The name of the program is My Front Yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| The house is looking very good, and I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| These are some of the houses that I believe Neighborhood Housing built these in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| These are brand-new houses, all affordable, Energy Star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| And, you know, they use some of our dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| They use some other dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| But then they sell these to low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| And, you know, obviously I've seen these and been by them and through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| and they really fit well in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| They're very cautious to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I know Councilman Brown at one time had a concern about some of the homes, maybe Habitat, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| but they didn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| They didn't really look like they fit in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| And these really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| They did a great job with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Yeah, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| We participate with our CHOTOs when they have house designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| And, you know, we make sure that if it has to go to an infill review committee, that that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| that, you know, they meet all the requirements of any other builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| Is this some of the infill housing styles that MPC has put together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| They put together a little architectural book of house styles for infill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| These are separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Okay, moving on to chronic problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| And this is covered under our acquisition and disposition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| These are some that we've acquired and then sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| Council approved both the acquisition and the sale of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| This is on Beaumont Avenue right across from the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| You can see before what it looked like before boarding and lot clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| And it has sold, and the owner is in the process of rehab right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| So it already looks a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| Here's one on Gill Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| You can see the before on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| The back was burned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| It was really an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| And then after boarding on the right, and we just sold that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| So we anticipate it looking better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| What kind of ñ what did you buy them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| What did you sell them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| And, you know, what was the plus or the minus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| What was the real estate commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| I wasn't going to ask that, but since you did, it's always something important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| I can verify that there was no real estate commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| I was the one that took care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| But on Gill, when we purchase a property through the chronic problem property process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| we have to deposit an initial amount with circuit court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| and that is dependent upon an independent appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| The court process is sometimes quite lengthy, and the value deteriorates over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| However, when we initiate that process, we have to put that amount in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| And it's either the higher of what the property assessor has the property valued at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| or the independent appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| And this particular home we paid $22,000 for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| And over time, as we continued to have it listed with no significant interest in purchasing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2187)|
| 0:36:38| the final appraisal came in at $6,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| However, the successful bidder bid $9,500, which was $3,000 over the minimum due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2202)|
| 0:36:51| And any time we have a property that has been taken through the eminent domain process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| they must bid a minimum amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| And that would be whatever the current fair market value is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| And that appraisal cannot be older than six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| Do they have a certain time to build this out, you know, fix it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| In the Homemakers Program, the first step is it will go before a committee of all the applications that are submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| That committee reviews all those every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| And if a successful candidate is determined from that, they execute a homemaker's agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2242)|
| 0:37:31| That agreement specifies that they must obtain all of their financing within 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| And they must have any significant changes to the exterior of the home, if they're going to make any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| before an infill committee or the Historic Zoning Commission within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Or what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Well, their agreement would expire unless they ask for an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| and typically all those taken care of well before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| I'm seeing more and more now that people are coming to the application process with the financing secured in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| That takes care of, you know, 90 days right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| Are these folks that will live in the house or fixer-upper folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| When the committee reviews applications, we look at the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Sometimes the area has a market for rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| Sometimes it is primarily for homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| There is a scoring system based on the homemaker's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| If it is for homeownership, they get an extra mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| And if it is not for homeownership but it's in keeping with the area that there is significant rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| then it's not to their detriment either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| This particular home will be rehabbed and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| The people who are rehabbing this will not live in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| They live in the area, but they will not live in this particular home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| That's one we approved a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| A few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Cheryl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Chairman, there's a stranger in Mark Campin's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| I had a question about the city now, the appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| The city pays for all of the appraisals for these properties, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| Here's another one at East Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| You can hardly see it before the lot clearance and boarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| And then here it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| We do have a homemaker's agreement on it, and this will come before council to sell as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| And you did all the stabilizing, the roof tarp and whatnot just to get it marketed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| There are things we have to do on some of these properties to get them in a condition to where anybody can even look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| This one was in basically very unsafe condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| You couldn't even go in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| So there are things we have to do in order to get it prepared so people can go in and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2413)|
| 0:40:25| Here's another one at Plymouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| This is going to council next week to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| You see these are all before pictures, exterior and interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| The roof had literally fallen in with a lot of debris with it in the kitchen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| So we had to clear that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| So right now it looks like this, and somebody has put in an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| We've approved that, and we're ready to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| Here's some examples of facades, recent facade projects that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| The before at 2125 Middlebrook on the left is now a law office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| You can see it on the right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| And then the car wash, the Vol Car Wash at 2350 Magnolia, the before is on the left and the after is on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2472)|
| 0:41:25| Here's an example of our business expansion loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| This was originally funded with Empowerment Zone funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| We will continue to fund this program with the loan proceeds that we get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| As we get paid back, we will be able to do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| This is Three Rivers Market before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| This is the Merida Bread Bakery outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| I'm sure you all remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| And then this is what it looks like today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| It's a really nice business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| An asset to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| So not only is it, you know, helping the neighborhood in its appearance, they've doubled the number of jobs at that store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2517)|
| 0:42:06| They're providing a service for all the residents that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| It's really a positive benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| There's real parking at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| You don't have to take your life in your hands turning into those three spots on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Here's some examples of Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds and what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| Neighborhood Stabilization Programs were part of the stimulus money that the city got a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| So those were focused on blighted and foreclosed and abandoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| So we used them on several large buildings to create new housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| They were all focused on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| So this is Flanagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| This is before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| You can see the top, the gym there, and what it looked like on the right, on the exterior, and the after is below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2571)|
| 0:43:00| It created 48 units of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| They've leased about 10 at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| Are they all still veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| They've got maybe one that isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Eastport School on the top, that was an abandoned, blighted old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| We used Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds to rehab that into 25 units of elderly housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| And then the Dutch Valley project that I talked about a minute ago for our kickoff event is on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| On the left is what it looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| It was a foreclosed and vacant fourplex on Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| It really needed a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| It was really not in good shape at all, and it was completely vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| Knox Housing Partnership purchased that property, tore down the old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| and rebuilt six units, all three bedrooms, that are LEED Gold certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| And they're all visitable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| What do you mean by visitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| They have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| IndyCamp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Visitable to persons with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| There's no more than a single-step entrance, and there's an accessible bathroom on the main level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2656)|
| 0:44:25| On the Red Valley Way property, is there no inviting facade that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2665)|
| 0:44:33| Come into me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| I mean, it looks like just an industrial building of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| Well, it's turned sideways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| It doesn't face Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| It faces inward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| The doorways are in that little courtyard area in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I can see the little awnings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| That may not be a very flattering picture of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| It's not flattering from this angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| I was on Knox Housing Partnership's board at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| and you see what it looked like on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| It was in pretty rough shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| We determined that it was not renewable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| and those ended up being very energy-efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| It leaked gold, so that's where the money went into being energy-efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| I'm just comparing it to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| We saw those infill houses that we saw before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Not a very flattering picture of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| They were a very attractive neighborhood house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Those are a very flattering picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| There's a lot of apartments out there on Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Not a lot of single family at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Let's recognize Councilwoman Palmer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Ms. Wade, you mentioned that the Red Valley Way places are visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| Are we moving more in the direction of requiring some kind of a design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| We have a population that will probably need more visitable access to places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Is this something that MPC and others are moving toward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Our department is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| We certainly are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| When we fund houses, whether it's done by a CHOTO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| or whether we build the house ourself, if it's at all feasible to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| we require that it be visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| Just some highlights of the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| We've talked about the Pinnacle Bank $2 million that's coming to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| We were able to partner with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| and the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises for $2 million in private funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| and that is specifically for our owner-occupied rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| That starts July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| And the way that works is we will continue to do the construction, the rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| At that point, FAHE will come in, purchase the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| They will service the loan with the resident, the homeowner, for the 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| and we will get our program income back all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| It's a refinancing of the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| I'm being corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Menville Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Sell your 20-year loan and get the cash back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Sell your 20-year loan and get the cash back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Yeah, it's a refinancing, basically, of the loan that we have with the owner-occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| We receive payment, the refinancing, and we're paid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| and then FAHE services the loan for the 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Menville Manor, a project that was also done with the Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| was awarded the 2011 National Trust HUD Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| This is one award in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| and that was given to Menville last year at the National Trust's annual conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| We implemented or monitored over 80 projects and hundreds of individual activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| home rehabs, rebuilds, acquisition of properties, disposition of properties, loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2885)|
| 0:48:13| and all this, the result of all this, is services to many, many families in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2893)|
| 0:48:23| We worked with the Vacant and Blighted Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| I know you're familiar with the new ordinances that are being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| A lot of that has come up from work that came from the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| We're working on tax foreclosure reform at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Once again, that sort of came out of an organization committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| that was founded in the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Our Office of Neighborhoods is developing a capacity-building training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| for neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| and we have ongoing achievements in visitable, healthy, sustainable, and energy-efficient development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| And we also had a successful HUD monitoring visit last year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| Just for a moment, I need to talk about the substantial amendment to the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| The city of Knoxville was awarded additional emergency solutions grants in the amount of $46,321.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2960)|
| 0:49:29| That's for the current year that we're in right now, not the year we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| This is for the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| We were awarded that money, and it fell under new regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| not the ones that we funded the other projects with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| So HUD is requiring that we do a substantial amendment to our current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| and tell them how we're going to be using those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| This substantial amendment was posted on the website at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| The same day as the annual action plan on 316.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| We will have a public hearing on it, and it will be submitted to HUD at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| The new funds are governed under the HEARTH Act, the new HEARTH Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| that governs emergency solutions grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| and it focuses more on homeless prevention and rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| So all of our funds are going to fund homeless prevention activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3021)|
| 0:50:31| Well, that's the end of my presentation, unless you all have any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| Any comments that you might have or questions will be included in the annual plan that's submitted to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| You have seen a significant decrease over the last few years in your revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| Do you expect that over the next two to four years, and if so, what would you recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| How do we get over that hurdle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| You know, there's organizations that try to educate legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| about the good things that community development funds do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| One of the purposes of our tour during Community Development Week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| is to bring in Senator Alexander and Senator Corker's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| as well as Congressman Duncan's staff, to see exactly how these funds are spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| and who these funds help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| This is one way that we have of educating our legislators to possibly think twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| before cutting these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| These serve low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and individuals, and, you know, it hurts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3104)|
| 0:51:52| There are programs that we can't fund because we've been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| As far as what's going to happen next year, it's very hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| We're fighting to keep funding at least at a stable level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| You know, we'll have to continue to cut programs if we get cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3127)|
| 0:52:15| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Becky, I'd like to thank you and your staff for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| I know it's an annual requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| At the same time, I think it's very healthy for all of us to hear this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| and just sit back and look at the accomplishments and how much you do with so little money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| To me, it's amazing when we see examples of neighborhoods, businesses that have been stabilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| communities that are coming with new life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| I think that it's a tribute to what you all do, as I said, with not a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| but we're pleased to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| I think I can speak for the other members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| I would like to recognize my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| They are a very dedicated group of professionals that work very hard to implement all the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| that we do with community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| We work as a team, and we work with other departments in the city very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| and we are about doing the good work that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Councilwoman DelVal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| How were we able to get away from that big, heavy notebook that was covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| Oh, you'll get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Oh, we haven't escaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| You'll have that when you have to approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Is the contents of that on the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Yes, that's what's on the website right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| That was fun thumbing through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| Seeing no other lights, I mean, it's public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| I don't see anyone other than staff and the press that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| but we'll go ahead and make that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| And seeing no one come down, if there's no further business to come before us, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120329?start=3233)|
