| 0:05:39| I did not realize you had to have a three-compartment sink to sell hot dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=339)|

| 0:05:51| to put back in the facility where they had removed a three-compartment sink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| But we're not going to have a deli as far as inside the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=356)|

| 0:07:52| IFB, Jubilee Markets Incorporated, SmartServe Number 4, 8432 Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| formerly House Mountain Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Sir, please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| My name is Aziz Karani, 8432 Washington Pike, Corvin, Tennessee, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| I'm going to ask you a series of questions like I just asked the previous gentleman regarding your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor or a felony involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| My understanding, beer has been sold at this location before, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| But it's been quite some time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I'd say about six months, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Now, we're going to need several things from you, a copy of your business license, your certificate of registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| and we need a surrender of the old beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| That won't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| We do have our application pending with the Tennessee Sales and Use Tax Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| We should be getting that in this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| We've already spoken to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| As soon as we get that in, we'll go and apply for the county business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| and when we actually receive our new permit, we will surrender the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| It's my understanding this is for off-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Do you own this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Well, we don't own it as of right now, but we are in the process of closing on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| Do we have a date in mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Do you have any idea when that will happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Well, we were supposed to have closed on the 28th of this month, but that has been pushed back some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| I will inform the commission or the inspectors of a new date as it comes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=577)|
| 0:09:37| I understand that at this juncture, you know, the commissioners can't issue you a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| until such time as you own the premises, you've closed, you've received your certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| Do you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Who's going to operate this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Do you have a business partner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| It's me solely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| And have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| I have completed the ask program with the city of Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| However, I do need to check on the expiration date of that certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| I do believe it is still valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| If it is not, I would go through another certification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| I'm going to ask our staff some questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=619)|

| 0:10:40| Are these re-inspections also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| The original inspection is needed upon ownership of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| And, of course, that's also pending the change in ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=653)|

| 0:12:52| It really doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Let's see if we have a motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| This really doesn't have anything to do with the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| And while that is not within my district, I have had comments made about the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| And I hope you are aware of the noise ordinance in the county because I've had several complaints about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| Yeah, we're aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| And we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| And actually I'm trying to go above and beyond with, you know, I don't want to take a position that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| 11 o'clock is 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| We're trying to communicate the best we can with the neighbors around and try to be good neighbors to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| because that's who we actually want to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| And I've tried to start a dialogue with those that will contact me and talk with me and speak with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| And most of them have been pretty good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| And we're trying to make sure that we are, that we understand their situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| And I think we're working through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| We have had someone that did come in the other night and, you know, we're pretty much out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| They didn't identify themselves or otherwise and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| And I had talked to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| He's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| But I had called him earlier this week because I just wanted to see if he had got any calls to see if I could find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| who it was so that I could start a dialogue with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| I know that in the past, the restaurant has had a lot of issues between neighbors and noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=851)|
| 0:14:19| And we're trying to create a different environment out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| But it's going to take a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| So we really need people like if someone contacts you guys that you put them in contact with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| because I'm not intending to treat them the way they've been treated in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| So that will just be real important to us because they're probably not going to contact us as much as they contact you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Just one housekeeping problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| You know, sometimes when we get these applications in here, to me an application is not legal unless it's completed fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=891)|
| 0:15:01| He just said he's a minor partner in this, but he's the only one listed on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| I believe he said he has a minor partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| I have a minor partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| He's the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| I'm the majority stockholder in the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Well, are we not supposed to have all owners and partners listed on these when they come through to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| We generally require the majority shareholder, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| and that's why during this colloquy we do inquire as to any other ownership for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=924)|
| 0:15:35| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=937)|

| 0:16:56| You have to surrender that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Sure, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| And this is going to be for off-premises only, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Now, do you own this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| We will own the business as of tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1025)|

| 0:17:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| At this point, I'm going to talk to our staff, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1069)|

| 0:18:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Mr. Chairman, going back to what Commissioner Brown was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| I don't know, maybe next time we do these sheets up, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| it says name and address of all owners and partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Could we put percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Just add the word percentage in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Or a percentage of ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| Because I think that is a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| You have broad authority in terms of what information you require to make a lawful decision, yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1126)|
| 0:18:55| Well, my concern is this is not the first time that this has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| I mean, we see one name on there almost every month, and we know that there are other people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| And I think they ought to be all on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Can we do that, ladies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Mr. Law Director, I believe that these beer permits don't even have to be in the name of an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| Lots of beer permits are in the name of an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1159)|
| 0:19:28| Normally it's in the name of the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| But what we'll do, sir, just an abundance of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| we'll take another look at all of these documents and see where they can be refined and more exacting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| If you go in places like Food City and things like that, normally they're in the name of the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| Certainly in these drive-throughs, most all of them are just in the name of an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| They're probably doing a corporate designee, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1187)|
| 0:19:58| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, we've got a new director of the Alcohol Beverage Commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| She needs to come around and probably introduce herself to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| Oh, I didn't even see you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1212)|
| 0:20:21| It's Metropolitan Drug Commission, Karen Pershing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| It's great to be here with you today, and I look forward to working with all of you as we move forward in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| I have a public health background, and so I did some alcohol and drug prevention work in the early 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| and I'm very much looking forward to getting back into it full steam ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| And anything I can ever do to help you all, just please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Commissioner Brown has orchestrated almost a monthly meeting of all of the players, so to speak, city, county, legal, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1250)|
| 0:20:59| I'll contact Joe Lee and the commission office to ensure you're put on that distribution list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| I don't know, Commissioner Brown, do you have a future meeting planned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| We canceled this month because of the budget meeting, and I've not gotten with Joe Lee yet to see when we can get a June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| We will be having one in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| We'll get you on that distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| But I need your card if you have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| I'll get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Then no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| This meeting is adjourned until 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100525beerboard?start=1290)|
