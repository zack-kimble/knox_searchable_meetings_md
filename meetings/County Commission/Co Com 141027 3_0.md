| 0:04:03| Do you refute or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| I can't deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| My employees sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| At this time, you will have an opportunity to bring your side of the case before this board if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| Well, I sent all my employees to the beer class, and she didn't follow my instruction or the instructions she took in the beer class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| and sold the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| From now on, nobody else will be selling beer except me at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| All of them are not going to be handling the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=270)|

| 0:04:39| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Mr. Nasser, this is your second offense, and I think I told you this the first time you were up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| The former owner had a couple of offenses before you bought this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| and I'm not sure whether there were any relation to you or not, but I warned you about having to come back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=294)|
| 0:05:04| You told us last time you were going to be the only one selling beer, so you're telling us that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| We've got two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| We can fine you or try to revoke your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| At this point, I'll make a motion for a $1,000 fine or second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=319)|
| 0:05:27| Or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=327)|

| 0:12:13| I showed the calendar that we keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=733)|

| 0:14:04| The lady that works for me that sold the beer to a miner, she worked for me for seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| and she has passed four beer stings, and she has her classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| But on the spot, I got rid of her on last night, so she doesn't work for me no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=853)|

| 0:14:22| so that should at least prove that we are trying at Town and Country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=862)|

| 0:14:50| $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=890)|

| 0:14:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| I've been up here six years, six years of beer boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| and I have yet to have anybody take the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| So they've either got real deep pockets to pay these fines or we're not fining enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| So maybe that's something we need to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| That would be something that we could probably put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| and have a public hearing and then have action of full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=928)|

| 0:53:16| Resolution 110 is appointing or reappointing an individual to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3196)|
| 0:53:25| First, I will make the report from last Monday's public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| I don't think we had any names identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| We have only one name, resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| We have one named resume before us, and that is for Scott Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| Is Scott Daniel here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3225)|
| 0:53:55| Since he applied, we will assume he will serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| We had an e-mail from Anthony Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Did he not send a resume in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| He sent two e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| I think he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3250)|
| 0:54:18| Okay, we have an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| I may have messed up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| This application, you just said you were interested in the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Would you speak to us then, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| Anthony Brown, 2629 Sunset Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| I was interested in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| I tried to reach someone and get more information over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| I was unable to reach them because they were out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| And I knew we were having this meeting today, but I didn't know what else was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| And then I talked to you about it personally this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| and we talked in great detail what the job would entail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| And I would very much be interested in doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| if it would be allowed for me to send in a resume later this week or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| What we will do here in a moment, as soon as we get through with the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| will be to make nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you, sir, for your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| No, that's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| Chairman, what was the deadline on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| Last Monday, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| See, I personally never saw the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| but I did see an email where he was interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| and then we got the resume this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| And so I never really saw anything that said this is the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| There is a good explanation for what is the deadline right this instant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| This instant is the deadline, in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Resumes should have been submitted earlier so we could have reviewed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| but nominations can be made up until right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| So now we have a new deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| And in just a second, we'll have a second down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| I mean, surely there's some type of a process of being interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| and recruiting and advertising that this is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| and what the job entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| This candidate did not find out what the job entails until right before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| and I just don't think that's the way we appoint someone to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| Maybe we should postpone this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Do I hear a motion that we defer for a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| What we have before us is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Since we've had a little bit of difficulty in getting responses in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| we have a motion before us to defer until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| The gentleman sitting out here is at every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| and when we put the word out that the resume should be sent in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| I'm sure he's probably sitting out here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| Now, I don't know how much of a formal invitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| more of a formal invitation you need than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| but I assume because he'd sent the email that he'd sent a resume in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| The deadline was last Monday, originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| The public hearing was last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| Well, the other gentleman's not here either, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Well, if that's the case, then I don't see we have any alternative but to postpone it for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3469)|
| 0:57:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| And I'm okay if the body wants to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| but I just want to make probably some of the new commissioners aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| with any kind of appointment like this, we can always take applications from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| There is no requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| If you don't submit a resume, we cannot consider your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| If you don't apply by this deadline, we cannot consider your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| I just want to, you know, again, I'm okay with postponing this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| but the process is intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| I mean, I think we did our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| There's just not much interest right now in this particular position for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| I don't know what that reason is, but as far as it being proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| it would be proper to nominate someone from the floor today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| We can vet that person or not, and we can cast a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| Again, the body can act however the body wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| but I just want to make sure that folks understand there's no set deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| after which time you cannot be considered for whatever position, audit, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| The new deadline is a minute from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Commissioner Busler has his last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| I wasn't sure what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| I don't know how you advertise for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| I don't know how you ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| How did we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| How did we ask for nominations, or did we just word of mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| or did we advertise it in a paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Did we make a public announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Out of the commission office, Ms. Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| Yeah, we did a legal notice, and it has to be put in the paper within a certain amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3585)|
| 0:59:53| and that was done, plus it was blasted out to everybody in the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| and everybody was supposed to be aware, plus it was announced at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| And then in the process, if any nominations do come in, when do we talk to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3606)|
| 1:00:15| Do we talk in public forum or at a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| We will have, if there are any additional applications, we will have those at the next work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| And interview them then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Don't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Which one of you is going to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| I'm not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Mr. Chairman, I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| There's no reflection on you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| I just feel like, and I understand everything you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| but we need to make sure that the public does know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| because we've only got two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| I just don't think enough people knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| I just think we might have to make sure that people do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| so that we do get a good cross-section of Knox County to know about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| and we may very well vote on the gentleman here and have him on the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| but I just think we need to make sure that people do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Not a high-paying job, though, is it, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| I was just going to say, I mean, I think the only thing we can do is to make a legal notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| I think probably the best way to do this is that we should have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| We've had as many as 22, I believe, applicants for this position in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| In the past, the mayor got to make some, the commission made some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| and even the Ethics Committee got to pick some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| I was on the Ethics Committee from the time we formed it up until about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| but I think a good way to handle this would be to have our public hearing during the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| We can take nominations right up to the time we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| but a person that has not submitted an application, has not submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| and I shouldn't say an application, has not submitted a CV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| and has not submitted himself to the public forum is going to be at a disadvantage to those that do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| but every commissioner can vote for whoever he wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| but we could have the hearing or the public forum on this next week, I mean, next workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| and then vote on it at the next full meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| and that gives a chance if people want to talk to the commissioners independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| you know, between the time of the public forum and the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| We did have notice in the paper, and we did have a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| and what we have put in front of us now is to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| You know, these public notices cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| These aren't cheap things when you start putting things in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| so you all can get with Jolene and talk with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| She can fill you in on how much we pay for this, but it's not a pittance to so continually do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| I think, you know, she has an e-mail blast to all the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| and there's, I don't know, hundreds of e-mails on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| We're having a public conversation for the second time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| I guess I just don't know how much more we want to do, and I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| We can take out a half-page ad if we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| but I just, for whatever reason, don't think there's a whole, whole lot of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| Now, if we as commissioners want to go out there and solicit people to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| that might be a way to do it, but in terms of just throwing another public notice in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| I don't think that in and of itself is going to get us a lot more advertisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| And my quick question in terms of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| So we have two applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| What do these two applicants need to do to fulfill their intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3834)|
| 1:04:02| Does Mr. Brown need to submit a resume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| Does the other gentleman, I forgot his last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| Daniel, and he has presented a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| So is that, so if Mr. Brown submits a resume, then he and Mr. Daniels will be considered next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| They don't have to do anything further is what I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| They need to be here for the discussion and questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| Now, do we have a deadline for any other applications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| As stated when we started the discussion, the deadline is right before we cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Now, how do we choose these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| How many is on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| How many is on the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| What's before us is one vacant seat, and that's all we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| I know, but how many total do we have on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| What's before us is to fill one vacant seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| Any other discussion about the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| Let's try to research that between now and the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| I don't know how much plainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| You heard what Joe Lee said a while ago as far as how many people and who all it went to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Who else could you notify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| No need to send it to the White House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Yeah, just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Mr. Chairman, are we required to put it in the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| The second time, you are required to put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| The second time, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Then don't do it because I don't think that's doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| But I think us as a body needs to go out there and do recruit people and let people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| I mean, of all the contacts this board has here or commission has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| they should be able to inform the public people that they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| A point well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Does your motion as it now stands say for the commission office to email BLAST?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3951)|
| 1:06:03| Point of clarification in terms of if there is another meeting, there will need to be another notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3963)|
| 1:06:13| Well, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| We have two candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| One is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| So if the other candidate comes next month, we can talk to these two candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| At least we have two people to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| Right now, we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| Some of us are not even sure who the other candidate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| It's hard to vote on someone when you don't know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| I just want to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| I think the law department has given us something we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| and that we will hold nominations for the position of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| Right now, we will hold the nominations and we will defer the election to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| The motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| We have a motion on the floor over here that we'll have to have withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| I withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| And the new motion will be just for the purpose of getting some discussion going again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| Just a second, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| I think you're saying that the new motion will be to open the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4043)|
| 1:07:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| The motion and the second has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Now do we have a new motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| The motion that's before us is to hold nominations for the position of the vacancy on the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4060)|
| 1:07:49| with the election to occur at the next full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| I think we need to add on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| We will have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| No, we are going to hold nominations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| That is the motion I'm making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| The motion that is before us is to hold nominations for the vacant member of the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| with the election to occur at the next stated meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Why I was asking my question while ago was that there's nine members on the ethics board, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4106)|
| 1:08:35| And it seems to me that nine members means there's nine districts in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| but we don't have to have a representation from any specific one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| That's all I was asking was is there a specific position open if they're representing a certain district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4127)|
| 1:08:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| We don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| No, this committee is just a countywide committee, and they come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| They apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| You vet those nominations, and then you elect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| They're not assigned by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| Go ahead and put a mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| This is your all's nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Other bodies across the government also have nominations, but they're not expired right now is what I think Commissioner Briggs is wanting me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| So it's our responsibility to get our nominees out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| It's not just one that we go to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| We can go to each one of our districts and, say, get a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| When you have a nomination before this body, you can go and talk to anybody in your district about applying for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| In the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| This isn't a district issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| But it's our representative from the commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Right, but it's not a district issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I'd like to make a nomination, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Wait just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| We're not ready for nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| I thought the floor was open for nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| We are ready for nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| We'll begin in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Yeah, we always begin in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| Begin in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| I thought the 11th over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| That's not necessarily a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Can you restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| The motion is before us that we will now hold nominations for the vacant seat on the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| and the voting will take place at the next dated meeting of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| Who seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| We will begin with nominations in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4258)|

| 1:11:47| Commissioner Brantley nominates Louis Cosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Do I hear a motion that nominations cease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Louis Cosby is on the Ethics Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| We'll have to check on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Louis Cosby has been on the Ethics Commission in the past, just to be sure there's not a conflict with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4327)|
| 1:12:15| We've got a whole month for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| That's the reason we have nominations today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| The nominations are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| We've got to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| I move that the nominations cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| I don't know who seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| It needs a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| But the point still remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| We can vote on this right now, but if Bill Smith comes up here next meeting and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| I don't want to put my name in the hat, it's in the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| We've got the motion before us that nominations have ceased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| and that the election will take place at the next stated meeting of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| May I be notified to be here for the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Ms. Jolie, will you notify the person that submitted a one's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4400)|
| 1:13:28| One is noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Could you notify the person that sent the resume to be here at the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4409)|
| 1:13:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| We're on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Resolution 408 is approving contracts with the Gulf Equipment Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| doing businesses Crowder Gulf LLC primary contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| and Phillips and Jordan Incorporated backup contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| to provide emergency debris removal services in the event Knox County experiences a major disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| resulting in an overwhelming amount of debris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| I hear second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| A motion and second is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| The reason that this item is reread and raised again is because during the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| I've heard several people asking why Knox County is purchasing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| not knowing when Knox County may need service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| So I believe it needs to be made perfectly clear today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| There is nothing being done other than we have the name and telephone number of someone to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4462)|
| 1:14:31| and what service they can provide in helping us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| if we have an overwhelming amount of debris in a public disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| I just want the public that's watching us today to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| there are no funds leaving Knox County as a part of this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| We're just putting them on call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Motion is properly before us and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| The next item is listed on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| It's resolution 902 directing the Knox County internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| to conduct a performance audit of the school nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| We have before us a motion to conduct an internal audit of the school nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4524)|
| 1:15:34| As a member of the audit committee and from the time the audit committee met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| until commission met this past Monday until today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| we have an ever-changing what are we going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| The resolution that's before us may be calling for the audit committee to perform this audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4548)|
| 1:16:02| to perform this financial audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Is it the will of this commission that this item be performed by the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4565)|
| 1:16:16| I believe is the thing that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| When we spoke of it earlier, it was like the audit committee was asking for the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| But what may be an even more overriding question is that the chairman of the Board of Education has also asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4584)|
| 1:16:36| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| It's my understanding there were, and I don't know whether Dr. McIntyre is still here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| there was I think from the education side there was an addition to the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| where there could be a risk assessment as well as a financial assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| And I think that they were requesting that this kind of all be put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| and turned over to the auditor where they could look at it in a multifaceted way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| And I'm trying to clarify that if anybody recalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| you may want to amend your resolution to that effect is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| Since we've had an audit committee, they have not done such an audit of a department like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| Why would they be asked to do it when right now we're one auditor short on the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4645)|
| 1:17:37| and don't have the expertise that our internal auditor has in looking at these matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| because of the way that Knox County operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| So I don't understand why that the audit committee, I had to be out of town in the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| but I don't know why they would want to do the audit and why it doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| The audit committee is at full strength and the internal auditor works for the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| So as an extension of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| is that the path that we, are we going to take the normal path of an internal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| and we full commission ask the audit committee, which is at full strength,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| and has as its employee the internal auditor to do the nutrition audit of the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4705)|
| 1:18:35| and also then we have a second question before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| Are we going to incorporate into it a risk assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| Well, as was pointed out last week, this body has the only final authority to approve an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| So why does it have to go back through the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| Because they've already suggested it, requested it, asked us to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| So in my opinion, this body does the approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| And that's what the motion needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| That's what the motion before us is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Well, you said go back through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| It don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| The motion that is before us is that the full commission acknowledge the letter from the chairman of the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4755)|
| 1:19:25| to audit the nutrition program of the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| A second portion of that request is to incorporate the superintendent's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| that it also include a risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| If that is to be done as the full commission will request or order, will that request go to the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4784)|
| 1:19:55| And my motion says that request will go to the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| so that this service can be performed by the internal auditor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| That's the motion that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| I believe McKenzie, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| You've got a second first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| And that really was the crux of what I was trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| I think that's proper, so thank you for getting the motion put in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4824)|
| 1:20:33| I have a question for Andres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| And you knew you weren't going to be able to get out of this without getting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| You were sitting at the ready, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| So question on whether is this an unusual request that the school board is making to add on the risk factors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4842)|
| 1:20:52| I don't know if you heard that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Is that an unusual request, and is that going to overburden or overtax your core audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| if this is approved of the nutrition program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| What we'll do is if you remember the criminal justice process audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| where we had some suggestions at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| They weren't findings, but they were suggestions to improve the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| It would be similar to those where you tack on something at the end of the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| not really the end of the audit, but the end of the audit report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| that says we looked at this from maybe a different perspective of just a traditional audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| and here's some ways to improve your program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Here's some risks that you might want to consider that aren't affecting your financial reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| but may be areas for improvement, may strengthen your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| So we would just add some suggestions on to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| and it wouldn't take that much extra time because we're already learning their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| We're already having the discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| It wouldn't be a separate project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| It would just be in the project that we'd currently be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| with the information we would have with the personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| having the same discussions with the personnel that we would normally talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| And I know they're going to get on my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Andrea Addis, 400 Main Street, Suite 319.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| When this goes to the audit committee, they have direction on what they're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4931)|
| 1:22:19| The direction to the audit committee will come from this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| So we put the depth and scope on it here, right, or does it go through the audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4944)|
| 1:22:31| Are we the audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| The depth and scope, using your words, comes from this board of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4953)|
| 1:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| In your own words, you just proved my point that that's not a needed step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| and I think that would be confirmed by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| I think I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| I've stood on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| I just called on Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| I think that we may need to change the term from request to directs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| Thank you, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| I now call on the law director to address Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| What we have before the body here is, and it's getting kind of convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| I'm going to try to help you all see what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Originally, the request for this resolution came from the audit committee to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| whereby you are going to give them the directive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| and what they asked for was to perform an audit of the school nutrition program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5013)|
| 1:23:40| and that the operational details of said performance audit shall be determined by the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| What was then added on to this, the reason that you need maybe to amend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| if you want to direct them to do both the financial and risk part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| and instead of letting them determine whether they want to do the financial and risk part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| is you would have to amend this resolution to direct them to do a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| and risk performance audit of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| Otherwise, you can just approve the resolution as is to direct them to do an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| and then they will determine based upon the auditor's recommendation and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| as to what degree that is done, the scope of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| Or you can amend this right now and set broad parameters for a scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| and then let them deal with the specific details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| That's the issue before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| We were just trying to incorporate the school's letter and the superintendent's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| and the audit committee's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| We have three different things floating here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| but the original resolution before this board gives no direction as to scope and performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5093)|
| 1:25:01| It says please audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| Since then, we've had some requests for specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| So if you want to address the specifics, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| If you do not, you can pass this as is and leave that portion up to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| That's my point, that we can address these issues as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Just a second. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Do I not still have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| The thing that was before us in the original resolution was on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5127)|
| 1:25:35| and as the law directors pointed out to us, it was something that would not fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| The audit committee, of which you and I are members of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| only had newspaper articles to deal with at the date of the audit committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| Since then, we have had a request from the Board of Education chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| asking us to do something specific in particular, which we are now trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5160)|
| 1:26:09| For us as the seated Board of County Commission to get something done in the audit field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| we're going to have a vote here in a few minutes to say that the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| which you and I are members of, are going to take care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| because the audit committee has asked the Board of Commission what do you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5186)|
| 1:26:34| and we are now responding to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| But my point is that they ask us what we're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| We can determine that right now, and we can vote on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| That's correct, and we can have as a part of my motion that it be sent to the audit committee to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5207)|
| 1:27:02| Other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| Commissioner Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| This question is to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| Under the state statute, you know, the county legislative body powers and duties in Section 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5231)|
| 1:27:20| does that not give us, when we get a letter that's saying that there may be a misuse of county funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5240)|
| 1:27:28| that we now have the obligation to direct and inquire in any direction we want to in that audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5248)|
| 1:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| I mean, I'm just reading part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| I don't understand some of this legal stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Well, a lot of things are going on legally and otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| and everything has been complied to in terms of bringing potential issues before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| We have three different paths coming for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Let me read the first part of the resolution, so I think it will clear up Commissioner Brown's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| I think it will clear up Commissioner Wright's conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| The Knox County Auditor you're wanting to direct, hereby direct, to conduct a performance audit of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5285)|
| 1:28:13| So what you're doing is directing the auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| and the operational details for that audit originally was going to come through the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5297)|
| 1:28:25| but this board will give the directive that we want an audit performed on the school's nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| That was the way it was originally put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| and then they could send it back for the audit committee to determine the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| But since the resolution was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| we have had a letter from the chairman of the Board of Education requesting with specificity some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| and we had a conversation with the superintendent of schools before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| requesting with specificity of risk assessment type issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| To address all of that, this body needs to probably amend the motion that the operational details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| of said performance of the audit shall be determined by the county audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| but specifically address the financial and risk management elements of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| Something like that is what I'm trying to get you to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| But this body will direct an audit or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| It's not the audit committee that will say we're going to have an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| This body, Commissioner Brown is on point, that you all decide to have an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| And then through this act of this board, it's the scope and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| you can leave it to the committee and then let the auditor address what she thinks is the risk assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5383)|
| 1:29:51| and financial assessment or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| and leave it up to her to work the details out with the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| Or you can specifically address them to do an audit, conduct a said audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| and address risk and financial elements and other issues that they may deem important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5405)|
| 1:30:14| Well, the way it stands right now, it would have to go back to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| It isn't going to have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| We're still lazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| No, it doesn't come back again, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| You are directing them right now with a vote to perform an audit of the school's nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| That's what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| You can't argue with a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| Well, I've still got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| He still has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Are you finished, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| Now, what I'm hearing is we need to amend the amendment we have before us or the direction and add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5445)|
| 1:30:58| No, if you have a choice, you can direct with specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| or you can let the audit committee develop the scope of this audit you are telling the auditor to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5463)|
| 1:31:12| One, the way it came before this, the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| is that the operational details of this performance audit will be determined by the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| That's what the resolution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| You're saying do the audit to the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| You're allowing the auditor to work with the audit committee to come out with any specifics that you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| and how the audit will actually be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| or turn it over to the auditor to do that, which is their professional duty as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| If you wanted to give a stronger direction, you would have to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| That's all because you had some specific requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| But if you want to leave the addressing of the specific requests to the auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| because professionally she will develop her scope and assessment or the audit committee, you can do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| But right now you're voting to say you hereby direct to conduct a performance audit of the school nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5528)|
| 1:32:19| You're saying to the auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| you are hereby directed to conduct a performance audit of the school nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| That's what Commissioner Brown is saying, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| That's the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| That being done, you can either direct with specificity or say the auditor sets the total scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5554)|
| 1:32:43| or the committee can help set the scope or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| Or you can be silent on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| This particular resolution right now says that the operational details of said performance audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5572)|
| 1:32:59| shall be determined by the committee, meaning you've ordered her to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| And if there's specifics, she will come before this audit committee and get specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| You don't even have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| You can order her to do it and leave it up to her professional judgment and that be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| It's entirely however you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| The problem is that it was getting convoluted from different requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| If you wanted to address each of these requests, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| If you want to leave all of those requests to the auditor, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| If you want to go back through the audit committee to help give her guidance, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| It's entirely up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| But what is before you is to direct the auditor to direct her to conduct a performance audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| of the school nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| That's the real question before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| And what detail you want to go beyond that is entirely up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| But that doesn't come as an amendment, right, to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| The way it is written right now, Commissioner Bussler, if you vote on this amendment as written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| then the operational details of her audit will be determined by the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5649)|
| 1:34:17| If you don't want that, you can amend the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| If you want that, you don't need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| It's just the way the resolution is presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Currently, the resolution that he's referring to is in the printed format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| The direction, I believe, that I had in the verbal part of this was a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| in that we have asked for risk assessment and we've asked for it on behalf of the chair of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5678)|
| 1:34:51| And, Commissioner Brown, are there areas in this that are not being directed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| that the internal auditor, from the point of view of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| are there areas or scope that you're addressing to be performed that are not included in this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5703)|
| 1:35:11| No, but my point is that we can tell Ms. Sandry today, direct her and vote her to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5711)|
| 1:35:19| Without any further ado, she can start tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| Bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| And that is not in the motion that's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| No, it's not. It's got to go to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| Of which you and I are members. Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| Well, let's do something here then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| You know, I think we all want this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| I move that we amend it and we have the audit done by our auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| and that we amend it to where she also looks into any risk that might potentially be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| and then we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| And that motion is properly before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| What about guidance from the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| Mr. Chair, I have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| You know, it's amazing how quick you've come from the new guy to the old guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| So now I'm speaking from the old guy seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| One of the things, one of the reasons that we discuss using the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5782)|
| 1:36:30| is we had commissioners, I won't say on vendettas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| but they had issues, personal issues that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I direct the internal auditor to go and audit X, Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| I direct the internal auditor, and we were running folks around like crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5802)|
| 1:36:49| We can get back into that same stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| This is a noble one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| This is one that's going to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Like I said initially, everybody wants this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| There's no one in this room, in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| that doesn't think that the nutrition program is not going to get audited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| and that Andrea's group is not going to be the one that audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| But what we're arguing over, I think, is who's directing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| And one of the issues that we'll get into, because one of us will get mad about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| it's going to happen, one department, it's going to just make you mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| And you're going to want an audit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And we've got to kind of guard against that, to make sure that the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| if that process deserves an audit, because she's increased staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| but there's not enough of her and her staff to get all of our wishes and wills done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| So I just want to, again, from the new seat of the old guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| let you know how we got to vetting these things through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| And I would hate to lose that on one that's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| Who cares whether it comes from us directly or the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| I care that in the future we have a vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| This one, again, is going to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| It's just a matter of whether it's going to start tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| or whether it's got to wait until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| I want to second Bob's motion and get it called out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| But I just want to be. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Let me ask the law department the difference between the motion that's on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| and the verbiage given by Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| It may be just an understanding of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| Mr. Thomas's was that, in accordance with the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| we're going to direct the internal auditor to do an audit of the school nutrition program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| which will include both the fiscal and risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| And he left everything else out, meaning that she can start tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| It doesn't go back for the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| This is the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| I think the other one may be we're going to do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| but we're going to send it down to the audit committee for further direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| I'll second his motion if it hadn't been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| I guess I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| I think there was a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| And he's offering a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| No, and your motion was the second motion on the floor is what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| I don't think a substitute motion is proper at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| I think when we first read this into the record, there was a motion for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| and then your motion was a substitute motion that we must vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5987)|
| 1:39:55| We're going to see what was recorded by the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| We had an original motion to approve the resolution as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| and that was Brown and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| And then he made the ‑‑ really, he had this like an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| or a resolution amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| See, it means those are the only two motions that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| I made a motion somewhere in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| I have one for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6021)|
| 1:40:31| We're going to back up and say that the original motion as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| which was on consent, was removed from consent as we began the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6036)|
| 1:40:48| The original is what's printed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| But what was being presented on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| some of the verbiage was at request of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6055)|
| 1:41:02| and we have since then we've talked about lots of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| one being that the chair of the Board of Education has asked it to be performed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6069)|
| 1:41:21| and the other is whether or not we're telling Andrea to commence the work tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| or we're going to follow the protocol which we've had since the state legislature mandated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| that we have an audit committee, which to me is ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| No, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| We formed the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| You've used the audit committee as the processing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| It was state directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| But you're currently using the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| You give the directive to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| They ask you, they've made a recommendation to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| and they want permission to audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| and you all direct the audit back down to them saying, yes, you can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| And that was to divert, as Commissioner McKenzie well put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| the onslaught of potential all the auditors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| that we used to run the wheels of the internal auditor off about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| The procedure as you currently do it is that the audit requests go through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6145)|
| 1:42:33| They evaluate that and then they bring it up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| This board then votes to give them permission to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| Then they proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Unfortunately, some of the recommendations did not go through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6164)|
| 1:42:50| They came directly to this body the other day from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| That made it a little convoluted to the normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| Normally it would go before the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| The school would appear before the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| They would vet all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| The audit committee would make a recommendation to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| It would be in a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| You all would vote on it, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| And that bypassed your normal system to come directly before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6191)|
| 1:43:19| Now, however, that being said, the superintendent of schools has a fiduciary responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| and I can't speak for the reason behind it, but I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| If the superintendent of schools deems that there are misappropriations of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| it is his fiduciary duty to come and report to the legislative body, not the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| So you have kind of a catch-22 in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| He's got to follow the statutory regulation that he shall come before the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| which is not our normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| So that's what's happened here, and I don't know the motivation behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| whether, in fact, there is an issue like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| But what you have before you now is you can do whatever you want to do with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6240)|
| 1:44:08| But the normal procedure is to grant the direction of the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| and it goes to the audit committee, and however their process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| the auditor could start tomorrow if she's got the directive already from the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| to do this based upon approval of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| I don't know the details down at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| Or you can actually direct her to do whatever you want to do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| as we have a motion kind of on the floor because we have, I think Mr. McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| Commissioner McKenzie is correct, I think we have two or three motions on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| What came from the audit committee is not the final thing we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| So that we can get clearly what's before us for discussion right at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| Commissioner Thomas, please restate your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| Just that we take the resolution to direct our auditor to do an audit of the nutrition department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6297)|
| 1:45:04| in the Knox County school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| but we also give it direction to add on to that, amend it to give us a risk management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| or a risk of potential there so that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| what we're trying to do here is to take what the audit committee, which we trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| we're not trying to circumvent them, we're taking what they've already recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| and we're just giving it a little direction, add on the risk part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| And report to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| It's not a new resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| We're just taking the one and amending it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| This is a recommendation we got from the audit committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| So that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Now, we need to back up for just a second, and I'm working with you here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| Restate your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| Let me give you a little guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| This will help cure this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| According to our code, this is to be directed through the audit committee to the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6356)|
| 1:46:05| So the resolution as written can be amended to add this risk assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6365)|
| 1:46:13| fiscal audit and risk assessment, to the audit committee with approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6373)|
| 1:46:21| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| You can direct it, as Commissioner Brown says we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| and it goes to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| They direct the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| Then I move that we take the resolution to have the audit committee do this audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| but with the amendment that we have a risk assessment and that they move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6397)|
| 1:46:50| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Now, to make sure we're doing this right, I like what Commissioner Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| but also Commissioner McKenzie said we have something else before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Do we have to do something now before we get to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| We're right there where we need to be to vote on it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| And who has a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| Second to his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| Second to his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Substitute motion is properly before us with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| Mr. Chairman, the clerk would like some clarity from Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| and his substitute motion before you as to whether this is a physical audit and a risk audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6455)|
| 1:47:42| because it kind of dropped around in the second presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| We would like to amend, so you want to start from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| I move that we take this resolution and we send it to the audit committee to perform it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| but we amend it that we add to it a risk assessment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6480)|
| 1:48:07| Add to the financial audit a risk assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6490)|
| 1:48:17| Get your second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| Motion is properly moved and second is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| All in favor say...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| No, I just want to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| We have performance in our original statement, and I guess I'll ask Andrea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| The substitute motion does not have performance in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| Is there any difference between a risk assessment audit and a performance audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Well, the risk assessment wouldn't be part of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| A performance audit can look at things from a more operational standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| A financial audit traditionally would look at are the accounts fairly stated for financial statement purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6537)|
| 1:49:05| Probably for this one, a performance audit would be the best goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| It would let us look at their processes, efficiencies, effectiveness of their controls in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| They're already getting a financial statement audit from what I understand from the external auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| so we don't want to give an opinion on the materiality of the fairness of the presentation of their financial statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6558)|
| 1:49:25| but we would want to look at it from the aspect of what's going on, how are the transactions accounted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| what are the controls in place, how do we know that everything is accounted for correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| So to be clear, a performance audit is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| So I would ask the maker of the motion if he would take a friendly amendment to add that word onto his substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| Absolutely, I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| I would suggest the move that we take the resolution of the commission to direct the Knox County Internal Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| to conduct a performance audit of the school nutrition program with an additional risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| And whatever else she deems necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| So financial and performance is the same word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| I think what Commissioner McKenzie was asking is with a risk performance audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| a financial and risk performance audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| is something that will help the auditor understand more in audit terms what she's wanting to do or what she needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| So, Commissioner Thomas, the word financial occurs in there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| You just didn't hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| In other words, forget the assessment and use performance audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6641)|
| 1:50:51| Seeing no other lights before us, properly moved and second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6651)|
| 1:50:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6657)|

| 1:54:36| but since the audit was released after the last audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| and because I've received other questions related to what does that audit mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| I would like for the audit committee to review the PPU audit and bring this back to full commission at the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6889)|
| 1:55:01| Don't move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| It's not something to be—it's for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6903)|
| 1:55:10| and that discussion being that the audit committee will look at the PPU audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| and have further discussion with full commission in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| Other discussion? If not, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| Page 15, discussion regarding the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| You know, being a glutton for punishment, I went home after our work session last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6932)|
| 1:55:39| and listened to the work session of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6939)|
| 1:55:45| A lot of directors' voices died out on them there halfway through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| but that meeting, which was long, kind of reinforced my commitment to at least encourage the chair to continue this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6949)|
| 1:56:08| You know, as I listened to the dialogue from the school board, and I'm sure, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| there's a lot of new members, there are a lot of educators there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| and they're going to bring a value probably unprecedented to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6978)|
| 1:56:25| The conversation really got, in my opinion, down in the weeds level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| You know, I mean, they were talking about, you know, their classroom kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| and it just said to me, you know, it's more and more there needs to be a better understanding of how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=6994)|
| 1:56:42| I mean, I hate to say it, big government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| You know, like it or not, we're a pretty big government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| We're a pretty big school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| We're a pretty big county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| So, you know, one of the things that I think they left, and I'm sure Commissioner Wright can agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7010)|
| 1:56:59| the school board members that were on that body left with a better appreciation of the other things outside of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7019)|
| 1:57:07| that we have to deal with and we have to balance in terms of when they're asking for this much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| and we have other folks asking for, you know, significant increases to do the work of the county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7032)|
| 1:57:19| So I just, again, just encourage commissioners to ask both sides of the aisle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7039)|
| 1:57:26| and by that I mean the school board side and commissioner side of the aisle, is this a worthy thing to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7046)|
| 1:57:37| I think we'll move the county forward talking as opposed to not talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| At this time I'd like to advise Commissioner McKenzie that the responsibility, according to your own rules, has shifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7067)|
| 1:57:55| I know you were alluding to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| However, when you have a specially appointed committee, such as this one, and it has been in operation for one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7079)|
| 1:58:06| and it is gone, for it to continue beyond a year under your rule 5H and your commission rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7086)|
| 1:58:14| it now must be enacted by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| So now this is something that the commission body itself, meaning you or any other member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| can evaluate, assess, and propose a resolution to in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7103)|
| 1:58:30| So I just wanted to clarify that because a lot of you were, I mean, I'm not taking power away from the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| This is the board's rule as to how a special committee is formed, and the first time the chairman can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7116)|
| 1:58:44| but it's been a year now that that committee was enacted, and now it's gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7124)|
| 1:58:51| So by your own rule, you can create one by resolution, but since this is a joint one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| you may want to direct the chairman to work with the, you know what I'm saying, it might be a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7136)|
| 1:59:01| Anyway, I just wanted you all to know where we were in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| so this is something that any commissioner can bring about or help and work with the chairman on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| It's not just specifically his or her job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| As part of this discussion, one of the things that looking at other municipalities and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| especially one as big as what we have, sometimes the more people you get involved with opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7167)|
| 1:59:34| the longer it takes to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| And as a thought, and it's not a motion or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| it's just open for discussion that the chairman of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| and the chairman of the Knox County School Board meet on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| and discuss issues that concern both those boards and both systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| and kind of look at things and see if there are some areas of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| where the commission and the school board will not have to be fighting things out in public so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| and might have some agreements and things that they can legislatively put through on each of those boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| I don't know if that changes anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| I don't know why the committee went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| Obviously, it went away because no one cared about it or for some other reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| But we certainly will care about it when it comes to budget time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| and we always tend to have these issues and things we want to talk about then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| But I think you're right, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| in having an ongoing conversation between these two boards is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| because there's a large percentage of our money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| and I think our chairman should certainly be involved with their chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| Thank you, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Let me pause this for just a second to reenter the word from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7247)|
| 2:00:56| This committee, our half of it, of which Commissioner McKenzie and I were members of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7256)|
| 2:01:05| we were appointed at the will of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7265)|
| 2:01:11| But the technicality of our rules, as pointed out by the law director, says for the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| the first year it can be we can try this and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| But for the next year, we'll have to deal with it as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| A form of authorization or authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| Now, true, the two chairs can get together and talk to each other as frequently as they would wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7293)|
| 2:01:41| The problem's going to be is if you and I go talk to one of the members of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7301)|
| 2:01:50| then it becomes the public record, and we had expanded that to Commissioner McKenzie and I, two of four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7310)|
| 2:01:59| and then that four was a member of a body of eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| And we did discuss a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| We did not get to some of the issues that maybe needed to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| and I think that's why Commissioner McKenzie was bringing up the idea of how do we get extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| And I was unaware of it also, that we cannot be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| We have to deal with being a part of an ongoing, then, resolution of this full, complete body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7341)|
| 2:02:30| So, Commissioner McKenzie, your light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7350)|
| 2:02:33| Yeah, just real quick, just to let Commissioner Brantley know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| it really wasn't for lack of it just fell off because no one cared about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| There was a conscious decision to say we're coming to the end of our terms on a bunch of school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7361)|
| 2:02:50| and a bunch of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| Let's cease at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| And also it was a paid facilitator that was coming to the end of his term, paid term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7374)|
| 2:03:02| So we made the conscious decision to bring the issue up after the elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| and after people got settled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| So there was still great interest at that time on both sides of the aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| So just to make sure everyone understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| This is a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| The formation of this committee, in what way does it limit us individually as commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| to meet one-on-one with a member of the BOE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| If you create this committee by resolution, for example, and you're on that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7410)|
| 2:03:38| and your counterpart from your district is on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| then any time you meet with that person for any reason, that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| since it's a deliberative board that advises other boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| that meeting would have to be sunshined with specificity of what you're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| and the press would have to be invited to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| If you were not on that board in any way, you can meet with any school board member you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| because you're not an advisory body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| Yeah, without notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| Yeah, any commissioner right now can meet with any school board member they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| But if you're on a specific committee with specific members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| and that topic happens to be education, then that has to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7460)|
| 2:04:26| If you're just going to the ballgame to watch UT play and you don't talk about anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| then you're going to the ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| It's incidental contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| So it's a pretty serious notice issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| once you get on a committee that is an advisory committee to a deliberative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7477)|
| 2:04:44| Those topics have to be sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| And nothing can stop us from meeting, disclosing publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| and meeting as a group without forming this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| Without what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| Oh, no, if you're not on a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| any citizen can meet with any elected official for any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| just because you're an elected official doesn't take that power and privilege away from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| And you can meet with any school board member today that you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| as freely as any other citizen can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| It's only if you're a member of an advisory body to a deliberative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| That's where it gets serious then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| And then there is one other circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| You can meet with the full Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| but you and I cannot go meet with the full Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7534)|
| 2:05:40| Unless it's a happenstance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| Two commissioners can't meet with all the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| or two members of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| Now, I see that's raised another question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| No, I just want to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| I don't see why we have to form a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| If we could just have bimonthly, every other month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| every quarter meetings with the Board of Education members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| that way we wouldn't have to have a formal committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| that limits our ability to talk one-on-one with Board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| If we have an every now and then meeting of commission and the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| we would have to sunshine that meeting and have an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| But not with the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| As he said, not with a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| It could be the entire, both bodies invited to one meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| sunshined, properly noticed, with an agenda and minutes kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| Other discussion regarding the Joint Education Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| If not, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| The next item is discussion regarding the change of meeting times of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| At our work session meeting, the issue of changing our meeting times was deferred to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7620)|
| 2:07:12| But I added this back on to see we've got time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7632)|
| 2:07:17| We've got time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| If anyone would like to discuss or present a case for what we need to do related to meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7639)|
| 2:07:28| I think it needs to be a full board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| Full board here at any time this matter is taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| This is just a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| This is not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| Well, I hate to lick my calf twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Other commissioner comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7663)|
| 2:07:50| Moving on to the next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| The next item was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| It's discussion regarding the beer board finds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| Commissioner Brown, you added something to discuss beer board findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7679)|
| 2:08:05| As I said in the beer board meeting, I've been on this six years plus, a couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7685)|
| 2:08:14| and in my memory I cannot remember anybody taking the 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7694)|
| 2:08:23| It's always they pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| My opinion, we're not hitting them deep enough in the pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| There's going to have to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| The second discussion item is along the same order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| But, you know, my recommendation is that we double the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| and I think that it might be a good idea for us to think about that seriously between now and next workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7722)|
| 2:08:49| and have some further discussion on it because it's not helping right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7729)|
| 2:08:55| They pay the fine and go right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| In just a second I'll come back to you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| Mr. Law Director, what's the process of the beer board considering how its rules and regulations are written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7743)|
| 2:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| If you wanted to amend, number one, we'd have to weigh it against the limits in statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| Number two, these are ordinances that you all have passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| so you'll have to have your reading, your public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| It's not something we can't do before the next beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| But it can be something you all discuss, entertain, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7771)|
| 2:09:36| it's the will of this body as to how far you want to go, but it would be ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7776)|
| 2:09:44| Just to make it clear, we presently have an ordinance that says the first offense is a $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7784)|
| 2:09:53| The second is $1,000, and the third is $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| I understand it's $500 up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| You can do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| However, you know, keep in mind that most of these, yeah, it might be selling beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7803)|
| 2:10:11| However, you know, these are small businesses, and working with all their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7811)|
| 2:10:20| obviously some of them don't speak English very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| I mean, that could be an issue, just as we had in the beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| And I don't think these people are meaningfully doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| I think it just happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| It's just part of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| But I think by closing these places down and being too fine, you're going to hurt our tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| and it's a right of selling things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| I mean, we're about to have wine in grocery stores after the election possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| So you're looking at one part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| You're looking at beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| You're not looking at liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| You're not looking at wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| And we imposed some pretty big fines on these little guys, I think, and it's pretty strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| I was amazed how strict it is myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| But, you know, if the highway patrol was doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| I probably wouldn't be driving anymore because of fines that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| Well, you know, a lot of us, I'll put it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7875)|
| 2:11:23| if speeding got a $20 ticket, we'd pay it and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| But if suddenly that ticket was $500, I'd take my foot off the accelerator a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| And I think that by raising these fines, I mean, we have cartels or whatever you want to call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7894)|
| 2:11:42| that are running convenience stores in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| running the employees through like cattle through a slaughterhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| They need to be under the understanding that if they're going to have these employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| they need to know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| How often, very, very seldom do we see Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| or some of these big-name folks come up here under that for a penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| So I just think we just need to start hitting them in the pocketbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| and show them we mean business so they'll train their people better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| I'm not trying to put them out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| And 99 out of 100, probably more than that, I don't remember two that I can think of offhand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7941)|
| 2:12:29| that said they fired the employee, that didn't fire the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| And one of them was his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| He liked to eat too well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| So we need to do something to get their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| In the five occurrences today, I think everyone did say they terminated the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7962)|
| 2:12:47| But I'd also like to pick up on the fact that though we have had Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| and we have had Kroger's here before us, they may have a different kind of employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| but any of these employers or none of these employers have that control over the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| that's standing at the cash register that knew they were doing wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| that even the sheriff's department representative said they started arguing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=7993)|
| 2:13:22| because they knew what they had done wrong was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| They just don't, I don't know whether they pay attention or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| Well, we know they don't pay attention apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| But it's not the owner of the establishment that's getting clocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8012)|
| 2:13:38| at the picking up your foot on the accelerator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8018)|
| 2:13:45| You're in control of both of those when you say if it costs you $20, you might speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| If it costs you $500, you may not speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| That's all on Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| That's right, just like it's on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| But out at the convenience store, it's two separate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| They're shelling out $50 fines out every day, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| and it don't mean anything to them, or $500 fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| Just briefly, you know, the other side of this coin is that the person that's selling the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| to someone underage is over in Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| And, you know, maybe they're not concerned enough whether or not they're going to just get slapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| on the wrist over there or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| That's where, you know, if they were really terrified that they did it and they'd go to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| the person doing it, that's the person that needs to be in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| The owner can't just watch over every single employee all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8074)|
| 2:14:47| We still have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| This is another discussion item that was added regarding the ability to start civil fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8089)|
| 2:14:58| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| In talking with Roy Braden in codes, and I know talking to Bud, and he's talked to Bud about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8101)|
| 2:15:10| he sends his inspectors out, and here's John Doe, who's in violation of operating a business in a wrong zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8110)|
| 2:15:20| what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| The first time out, you know, they might give him a slap on the wrist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| But then they give him a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| They come to court, and they get a $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| What do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| They go back, open, open up again the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| Well, he doesn't have the staff to send somebody back out there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| But yet they're back in operation, and he goes out there again next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| They're still operating another $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| It's the same thing, as I mentioned a while ago, with the beer fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| But it takes a state change for us to be able to pass an ordinance to levy an additional civil fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8150)|
| 2:16:01| So this is something I think that, Bud, you might want to elaborate on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| and you've been working with Roy on, and kind of bring us up to date on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8164)|
| 2:16:11| Commissioners, we've been working for time now to try to get a civil quasi-judicial board similar to what we have in the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8171)|
| 2:16:27| whereby civil penalties for code violations could come before a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| Therefore, from that, the next step would be an appeal to Chantry Court, where there are no constitutional limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8193)|
| 2:16:42| When you appeal to Sessions Court, you're hung with constitutional limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| So if we have a $1,000 fine, and it's a civil fine without a board, it can be reduced to $50 pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8207)|
| 2:16:57| If you have a quasi-judicial body to review, like we do for beer board, it's actually a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| It's what goes on here every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8223)|
| 2:17:08| Then, if they don't like it, they appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| It has to go to Chantry Court, and then you have Chantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| You don't have a constitutional limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| We've been working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| There's two different philosophies, political philosophies, and one is that it's creating big government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8240)|
| 2:17:27| It's hard to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| The other one is similar to the hurting of business and this type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8249)|
| 2:17:37| We will be working on it again this year when the new state legislature goes into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8257)|
| 2:17:46| to see if they will allow our charter form of government to have a quasi-judicial board or even have it statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8266)|
| 2:17:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| But it's a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| We're just the ones stuck dealing with it, so I don't know for a fact whether anything will happen or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| It hasn't so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| Thank you, Mr. Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| I just think it's something that we need to every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| We're going to have a legislative dinner coming up here, which so far I don't think many folks have signed up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8291)|
| 2:18:19| It doesn't cost you anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| The Metropolitan Drug Commission is sponsoring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| There will be a lot of our state legislators there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| These are the kind of things that you want to talk to when you get a chance to bend a rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| So I want to bring that to everybody's attention and say, you know, you can't eat an elephant, but you can't abide at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8310)|
| 2:18:38| So this is an elephant I think we need to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| Mr. Vanderveet, did you wish to speak to this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| It's late in the day, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| I'll be brief, but I just wanted to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| An address, name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| Dwight Vanderveet, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| And I appreciate Commissioner Brown weighing in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| It is a huge issue for us, particularly in codes, which operates under the body of state law that the law director is speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8335)|
| 2:19:03| A couple points for this body's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| We have never successfully seen anything prosecuted out of Sessions Court for more than a $50 fine, and frequently we aren't even successful there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8346)|
| 2:19:14| Also, when you deal with these matters in Sessions Court, each one is handled individually or discreetly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| but the next time you come back, you can be with the same property owner for the same violation at the same location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| and you are again, if you're lucky, going to walk out with a $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| This is opposed to, for instance, the model that we use in Stormwater where we operate under the Stormwater Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| and we have civil penalties which are assessed administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| I'd want this body to know, particularly those of you that are new, that in Stormwater when we invoke civil penalties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8382)|
| 2:19:50| we always start with the premise that what we want is compliance from the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| If you have sediment coming off your site and it's damaging your neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| what we want you to do is get silk fence installed and get the violation corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| We don't want your $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| And in virtually every instance, we will always waive that first civil penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| because it's given us the opportunity to get you into the office and talk to you and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| we really, really need you to get this fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| But that next time when you've been in the office, and this occurs fairly routinely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| and maybe you fixed it the first time or maybe you just came to the meeting and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| oh yes, we'll be glad to get this fixed and you didn't and the next thing we know the problem occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| then when you leave, you leave with a $250 civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| About the fourth or fifth time that we have these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| we may ratchet up to $500 or in some cases as high as $2,500 for those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8441)|
| 2:20:48| that simply continue to damage their neighbor's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| and continue to violate the law just in flagrant disregard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| The same set of circumstances in Sessions Court is $50 every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| and as Commissioner Brown says, there is simply not much incentive in $50 to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| I would want this body to know, though, we don't want anybody's money ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| What we want is to get you into compliance and to do all we can to get you into compliance with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8469)|
| 2:21:17| Thank you, Mr. VanVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| Anything else on this beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| I need to address like four little items of thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| The chairman's lunch and tour last Monday, last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8489)|
| 2:21:36| was provided by the clerk of courts, former County Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| For those that participated in the tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| I think we were allowed to walk through areas of the city county building that I've never seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| and the tour was quite informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| Today's chairman lunch and tour tomorrow, that's this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8516)|
| 2:22:04| was provided by the development corporation, and Todd Napier drownded us in facts and figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8524)|
| 2:22:13| and I appreciate his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8533)|
| 2:22:18| Mayor Burchett is initiating a festive season recognition of veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8538)|
| 2:22:28| and it's called Wreaths Across America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| and I'd like to call people's attention to it because he's trying to place a wreath on every veteran's grave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8552)|
| 2:22:41| in the three veteran's cemeteries here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8561)|
| 2:22:46| and the price per each is a $15 donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8566)|
| 2:22:51| So those of you that could support the county mayor and wreaths across America, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8571)|
| 2:22:59| And then an outdoorsy kind of thing that the commission office has brought us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| is the Legacy Parks Foundation Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8585)|
| 2:23:10| It's their annual try to raise a dollar or two to help Knox County be a little greener| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8590)|
| 2:23:17| and have a little bit more of a draw, like the Seven Islands Bird Sanctuary, the only one in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8597)|
| 2:23:25| Other things that the Legacy Parks Foundation has brought to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| their $100 donation deal is November the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8610)|
| 2:23:37| and I think we have five or so commissioners that may be attending that luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8617)|
| 2:23:43| but I want people out there in TV land to know that it's a $100 a seat donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8623)|
| 2:23:52| It's a $100 donation to get a wrapped sandwich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| but you get a presentation about the green ways and green space of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8637)|
| 2:24:06| Those are my four things that I wanted to raise attention to here before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| and I asked if anyone else has anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| I would remind you that we will stand and recess until the 5 o'clock hour for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8655)|
| 2:24:23| I call this meeting of the October Board of Zoning request of Knox County to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8663)|
| 2:24:34| Madam Clerk, you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8674)|

| 2:27:33| but the Planning Commission recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| It's about a 10.2-acre parcel at the back of a built-out subdivision up against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8855)|
| 2:27:42| the floodplain with a rather unusual requested use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8862)|
| 2:27:49| But the Planning Commission recommended approval of ag and floodway zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| Seeing no opposition, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| I'll make the motion that we approve by MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8882)|
| 2:28:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| I'd just like to hear the uniqueness of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| Waiting with bated breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| We have taken the acreage on the back of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| and turned it into a small farm with rescue animals, donkeys, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8901)|
| 2:28:27| It's becoming a petting zoo, more or less, for the subdivision than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| Sir, I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| Jerry Cardwell, 508 Pebble Creek Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8914)|
| 2:28:44| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| If not, we have before us a proper motion to approve, seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| Next item is 9-C-14-RZ, general rezoning by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| to rezone from CB business and manufacturing to RA low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| The property is located east and west sides of Park Ridge Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| north and south of Spring Place Circle in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8954)|
| 2:29:20| What is before us is a unique situation in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| There is no applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| but we will receive a report from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8973)|
| 2:29:34| Yeah, this application was actually initiated by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| on behalf of a number of residents in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| It came to our attention through an inquiry by one of the residents about their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8982)|
| 2:29:49| They were dealing with a refinancing issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| and the bank learned that their property was zoned CB and became concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8992)|
| 2:29:58| So they came in to check about getting it changed to a residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| and we discovered that there were all or parts of 17 lots in this particular subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| that were zoned CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| So the Planning Commission initiated this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| It was approved on our consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| and the Planning Commission recommended approval of RA low-density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| This property being in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| I move that it be approved for Metropolitan Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| All of the lots included in this, or are we just talking about one particular lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| Is this an all-inclusive thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| Yeah, this is a general rezoning of about nine acres, which includes all or parts of 17 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9041)|
| 2:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| I think the uniqueness of it may be that this real estate is immediately adjacent to the railroad tracks along Loves Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9049)|
| 2:31:01| and may have, in history, been zoned industrial because of a railroad spur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9061)|
| 2:31:09| It's just this is a true-up of what the use is versus the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9069)|
| 2:31:18| Motion and second is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| Approved, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| Is there other business to come before the Zoning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9088)|
| 2:31:34| If not, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom1410273?start=9094)|
