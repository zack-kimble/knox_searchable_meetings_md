| 2:52:34| Absolutely. My apologies. Logan Higgins, 133 South Gay Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10354)|
| 2:52:41| We originally approached this as a neighborhood commercial zoning and met with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10361)|
| 2:52:47| a couple times, or I'm sorry, met with the neighborhood once, met with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10367)|
| 2:52:52| board another time, and were in conversation with different members of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10372)|
| 2:52:57| and had a lot of support. And then before the meeting on that, it was recommended and suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10377)|
| 2:53:06| not only by the neighborhood, but also by NBC to, instead of pursuing a rezoning that is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10386)|
| 2:53:13| a broad blanket neighborhood commercial, to go with the, back then, the new option, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10393)|
| 2:53:22| last year, of course, wasn't an option. But at the beginning of this year, it became an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10402)|
| 2:53:26| plan development. And basically, we looked at what we could do with neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10406)|
| 2:53:33| compared that to... With this project, we took neighborhood commercial and took out the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10413)|
| 2:53:41| that would be more detrimental to the neighborhood. Like Gerald Green said, a main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10421)|
| 2:53:46| thing would be a convenience store. And to back up this project specifically, this is a historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10426)|
| 2:53:56| school building in South Knoxville. It has really been unused for a few decades now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10436)|
| 2:54:03| or I think since the beginning of early 2000s. And the idea would be to undergo an adaptive reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10443)|
| 2:54:15| And this just kind of allows for that to have a little bit more of a commercial, which neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10455)|
| 2:54:22| doesn't really make sense for this building, but slightly commercial without being so heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10462)|
| 2:54:27| that it is detrimental to the neighborhood around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10467)|
| 2:54:33| Thank you so much. Any further questions for Mr. Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10473)|
| 2:54:39| So for Mr. Green, just to clarify, with this and any plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| what is being approved is what is being proposed. And if that occupant left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10483)|
| 2:54:49| anything... Because it has not been rezoned, anything in the future has to come back for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10489)|
| 2:54:54| reapproval. That's correct. And for example, in this case, the preservation of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10494)|
| 2:55:03| is part of the plan. So the school remains, whereas if there were blankets rezoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10503)|
| 2:55:10| neighborhood commercial, the school could be demolished in a new structure that would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10510)|
| 2:55:15| be compatible with the neighborhood to be built there. There are a number of protections with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| plan development. And I think those, when we get into the workshop, that some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10520)|
| 2:55:24| protections will be noted. And it is a balancing act, and it's a tough balancing act because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10524)|
| 2:55:30| we are allowing uses not permitted by the underlying zoning, but we're enabling uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10530)|
| 2:55:35| of structures that would not be permitted otherwise, preserving those structures or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10535)|
| 2:55:41| providing a community benefit, as we saw in the case of the BMC supported housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10541)|
| 2:55:47| It's a high bar to set for the developer and the planning staff is well aware of that. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10547)|
| 2:55:54| Planning Commission and City Council needs to keep in mind that the need to provide a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10554)|
| 2:55:59| benefit is a high bar and something that needs to be well thought out in the approval of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10559)|
| 2:56:06| plan development. Thank you, Mr. Green. Any further questions or comments? Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10566)|
| 2:56:13| I just want to thank Mr. Higgins and Mr. English. This may be a model that we care for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10573)|
| 2:56:19| the best in class, that they worked with the community from the very beginning, they made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10579)|
| 2:56:25| adjustments. They narrowly crafted this project to suit this neighborhood where it may not suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10585)|
| 2:56:33| others and listened well. And this is a very narrow fit. And it's a reuse of a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10593)|
| 2:56:41| old school and it aligns with the neighborhood really well. So I just want to thank Mr. Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10601)|
| 2:56:47| and Mr. English for taking that approach because it may be a best in class model for us to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10607)|
| 2:56:55| Thank you, Council Member Smith. Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10619)|

| 2:57:38| Was that everybody? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| Motion carries 9-0. Next item, please. 12-A is an ordinance amending Chapter 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10660)|
| 2:57:45| Article 7, Division 5 of the Knoxville City Code relative to the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10665)|
| 2:57:52| Move to approve. I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10672)|
| 2:57:56| Motion to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10676)|
| 2:58:00| No, that's okay. And then I would like to make a motion to amend and I have a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10680)|
| 2:58:09| explanation. I have sent a couple of things to Mr. Johnson to share so you guys will understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10689)|
| 2:58:20| Hold on, let me pull it up here. There's a couple of typos, very minor things. There's extra words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10700)|
| 2:58:27| that need to, Mr. Johnson, if you could go to the page with the stricken three words so I can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10707)|
| 2:58:34| my amended motion first. And then, okay. This is, let's see, hang on. In your packet, it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10714)|
| 2:58:46| I apologize, it's deep in thought about our last one. This is page 443 in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10726)|
| 2:58:53| And my amended motion would be to strike the words specific name changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10733)|
| 2:59:03| a renaming and renamed down at the bottom. When this got passed on to Attorney Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10743)|
| 2:59:12| and to the law department, these strikethroughs were missing. And so these words are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10752)|
| 2:59:21| of those. So it won't make sense if we don't strike these words. So I wanted to amend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10761)|
| 2:59:25| motion or what is proposed to strike those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10765)|
| 2:59:33| Second amendment. Okay. The motion made to amend as Council Member Ryder described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10773)|
| 2:59:41| and seconded by Council Member Fugate. Can you see the screen? It's just black on my end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10781)|
| 2:59:49| Oh, you can't see it? I can see it. Okay, we can see it. You can see it. That's all that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10789)|
| 2:59:54| I don't know why it's not working. So basically replacing the word additional with specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10794)|
| 3:00:00| namings with name changes, any naming, a renaming, and getting rid of the word renamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10800)|
| 3:00:09| in that last line of that section. If we didn't make those amendments, it would make a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10809)|
| 3:00:14| nonsense. I'll just real briefly speak to this item. Basically, the Public Property Naming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10814)|
| 3:00:24| Committee has been on moratorium for a little while, and I worked with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10824)|
| 3:00:29| staff. And I'd like to thank Mr. Green and his staff. He had about three different staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10829)|
| 3:00:36| that helped with this. And what they did was they reviewed naming processes across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10836)|
| 3:00:44| And I worked with them and met with them right before the pandemic started. So that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| slowed down the ability to have a public meeting with the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10848)|
| 3:00:54| And the committee, we went through the changes that were proposed. And one of the major changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10854)|
| 3:01:00| is to remove street renamings from the Public Property Naming Committee. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10860)|
| 3:01:08| that is something that was being heard by three bodies. It has to start with the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10868)|
| 3:01:14| Commission because they do addressing. Then it was supposed to be going to PP&C for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10874)|
| 3:01:21| additional public vetting. And then it was coming to Council. Streets are named when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10881)|
| 3:01:29| properties are subdivided, and people can apply for a renaming. I worked with the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10889)|
| 3:01:36| Commission staff and the research they did to give some criteria for how that would happen and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10896)|
| 3:01:44| to give some guidance. Council Member Ridership, we need to vote on the amendment before we go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10904)|
| 3:01:50| to it. So yeah, right. So you guys understand what the amendment is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10910)|
| 3:01:57| Mayor, if I could clarify, I see the strikethroughs are the highlighted language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10917)|
| 3:02:03| is that inserting those words? No, they're there. I highlighted those so people could see what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| new words were. Understood. Correct. So the amendment is just to strike those words in red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10928)|
| 3:02:15| and at the top one, ignore the fact that it goes through the C. So anyway. Okay. Does everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10935)|
| 3:02:24| understand the amendment? It's been made and seconded. If there are no further questions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10944)|
| 3:02:30| the amendment, please conduct a roll call vote on the amendment and then we'll get back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| motion as amended. Council Member Ryder. Yes. Council Member Berto. Yes. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10954)|
| 3:02:42| Yes. Council Member Smith. Yes. Council Member Testerman. Yes. Council Member Thomas. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10962)|
| 3:02:52| Council Member Dufuquette. Yes. Council Member McKenzie. Yes. Council Member Parker. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10972)|
| 3:03:02| Okay, the motion, the amendment passes 9-0. Back to the motion as amended. Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10982)|
| 3:03:09| Ryder is describing it. Yes, I'll be brief. Sorry, I know this is really exhilarating at this hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10989)|
| 3:03:16| at night. So anyway, the bulk of the amendments are criteria for making motions or honorary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10996)|
| 3:03:25| namings and applying names to public properties. The committee was formed under former council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11005)|
| 3:03:34| members Bailey and Roddy some time ago. There was a period of time where there were a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11014)|
| 3:03:38| renamings and they thought there should be a public process to vet it with some involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| And there's never been a formal set of criteria to guide both applicants and the committee for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11023)|
| 3:03:50| making this determination. So what I did with the Planning Commission staff was to look across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11030)|
| 3:03:56| country at best practices for what other folks were doing. So that is what is in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11036)|
| 3:04:02| And Mr. Johnson, just really quickly, I just wanted to highlight for you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11042)|
| 3:04:08| I'm not going to read it to you because you've had this packet to read. Mr. Johnson, yeah, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11048)|
| 3:04:15| basically pages 440 and 441 is the bulk of it. And that's the criteria for consideration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11055)|
| 3:04:22| naming requests that is all new to the ordinance. And then the committee that was not done with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11062)|
| 3:04:29| as chair, the committee will have the opportunity to change anything about the application and or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11069)|
| 3:04:35| the pricing that is left up to the committee that's not in the ordinance. And then the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11075)|
| 3:04:42| major change that I believe is something that was an oversight from the past. Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11082)|
| 3:04:47| if you will go to the part about the committee. Sorry, I sent them to him as JPEG images,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11087)|
| 3:04:55| not a presentation. There is page 441 in the packet. The original wording of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11095)|
| 3:05:08| was basically the ordinance gave the vice mayor the ability, no offense to any vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11108)|
| 3:05:13| but gave the vice mayor the ability to put three members on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11113)|
| 3:05:18| I believe what originally when this was an ad hoc committee, it was two members. Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11118)|
| 3:05:28| it's not this slide. It's the one that says members of the committee and they're not slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| So, I apologize. On page 441 of the packet, it says one representative of council nominated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11134)|
| 3:05:45| the vice mayor who will serve as chairman for a term of two years or until a successor is appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11145)|
| 3:05:52| The past language in the ordinance was two members that the vice mayor appointed in addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11152)|
| 3:05:58| vice mayor as currently the sixth district, formerly it was seat C, appointing someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11158)|
| 3:06:05| Right now with me terming off, there will be no member of council on this committee if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11165)|
| 3:06:10| make this change. So, I'm just proposing that so that there will still be that communique segue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11170)|
| 3:06:17| and represented when these changes come to council for a vote. So, that's my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11177)|
| 3:06:23| It does not also clarify in the top of the ordinance, it clarifies that does not impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11183)|
| 3:06:29| anyone that currently serves on the committee. All of those who are appointed to those current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11189)|
| 3:06:36| seats that were appointed by the former vice mayor will serve out their terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| and then this would take over. But once we pass this, if we pass this, then the vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11200)|
| 3:06:47| will appoint someone from council to be a representative from council on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11207)|
| 3:06:55| So, those are the big changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11215)|
| 3:07:00| Anyone has any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11220)|
| 3:07:01| Yeah, thank you, Council Member Ryder. Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11221)|
| 3:07:07| Okay, I may be wrong and it may just be because it's getting late, but did the term limits change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11227)|
| 3:07:15| Was there a change to term limits? They've always been four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| Oh, I thought I saw language about two consecutive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| No, it's still two, you can do two, you can serve up to two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11244)|
| 3:07:28| your term limited off and it's four year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11248)|
| 3:07:31| But I thought you were term limited off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11251)|
| 3:07:38| I am, I'm gone. Well, I mean, and as soon as the, I'm not on the, yes, I am term limited off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11258)|
| 3:07:46| and my term ended June 6th, but the committee is on moratorium to make these edits and proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11266)|
| 3:07:54| I'm reading it wrong then, I think it's because it's so late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11274)|
| 3:07:58| Because that was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11278)|
| 3:07:59| I was just going to ask, since you've invested a lot of time into this, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11279)|
| 3:08:04| we could make changes that would allow you to continue serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11284)|
| 3:08:09| Are you, yeah, well, I'm not asking for that. That is up to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11289)|
| 3:08:16| I, that is not what I was asking for. I didn't ask for any changes to the term or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11296)|
| 3:08:22| I just wanted to make sure someone from council still was on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| Originally, I had this conversation with Attorney Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| Originally, when this was an ad hoc committee, there were two council members on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11311)|
| 3:08:36| And when this was codified in 2014, that got changed to take the word council out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11316)|
| 3:08:41| And that's when the vice mayor started appointing three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11321)|
| 3:08:45| And so it just skipped over the council part so that you wouldn't have two council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11325)|
| 3:08:50| with a possible sunshine violation. So I'm just trying to fix that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11330)|
| 3:08:55| so that we have that council representation on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11335)|
| 3:08:59| Anyway, I know everybody's excited about this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| Well, I was actually going to say, anybody that's interested, just text or email me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11343)|
| 3:09:10| And thank you, Lauren, for your service. You've done an excellent job on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11350)|
| 3:09:15| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11355)|
| 3:09:16| And I will say, you know, Roddy and Bailey and Stair, all of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11356)|
| 3:09:22| Councilman Stair was the chair for six years. So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=11362)|

| 3:20:55| got a raise and I do agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12055)|

| 3:21:11| and I do feel that the policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| should receive a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12073)|

| 3:26:30| about the role of police in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12390)|
| 3:26:32| I've facilitated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12392)|

| 3:26:41| experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12401)|

| 3:26:47| social workers are trained to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| compassionately and nonviolently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| with people in crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| we understand the impact that trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| mental health, poverty, and systemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| oppression and racism have on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| and can respond appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| police have proven over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| that they are not interested in interacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| with people in crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| people who have disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| or frankly anyone who is black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| according to a report by the Ruderman Family Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| approximately half of people who are murdered by police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| have some kind of disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| and of course black people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| are at even higher risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| I would ask Mayor Ken Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| to call for a budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12443)|
| 3:27:25| to reallocate a significant portion of the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| budget to invest in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12447)|
| 3:27:29| one way to do that is to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12449)|
| 3:27:31| mental health workers trained in trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12451)|
| 3:27:34| for compassionate nonviolent de-escalation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| social workers can also help support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| and connect people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12458)|
| 3:27:40| who are experiencing vulnerabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12460)|
| 3:27:42| with resources that will help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12462)|
| 3:27:44| instead of punishing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12464)|
| 3:27:46| if we want a safe thriving Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12466)|
| 3:27:48| we have to transform our understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12468)|
| 3:27:50| of the role of the police in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12470)|
| 3:27:52| a safe community is one that is safe for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12472)|
| 3:27:54| not just white people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| I'll end with this quote from sociologist Alex Vitale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12476)|
| 3:27:58| part of our misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12478)|
| 3:28:00| about the nature of policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12480)|
| 3:28:03| we keep imagining that we can turn police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12483)|
| 3:28:05| into social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| that we can make them nice friendly community outreach workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12487)|
| 3:28:09| but police are violence workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| that's what distinguishes them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| from all other government functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| they have the legal capacity to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12495)|
| 3:28:17| violence in situations where the average citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| would be arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| so when we turn the problem over to the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| to manage there will be violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| because those are ultimately the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| that they are most equipped to utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| that's what's really at the root of policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| so if we don't want violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12515)|
| 3:28:37| if Knoxville wants to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12517)|
| 3:28:39| towards the goal of having nonviolent communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| we need to reflect that in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| a good first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| is to have a budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| and take money that's being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| to hire new police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| and instead hire capable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12531)|

| 3:29:55| and several buckets of human waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| that city stuff is not safe for anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| it's breeding crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| it leads to property damage, theft, rapes, murders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| assaults, batteries, poor hygiene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12603)|

| 3:30:15| and none of this is tolerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| just in this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12617)|

| 3:30:28| and force them into the shelters or take them to jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12628)|
| 3:30:30| they can't live out under the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12630)|
| 3:30:32| also I want to apprise you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12632)|
| 3:30:34| of an incident that happened yesterday at Owl's Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12634)|
| 3:30:36| I came to the aid of a woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12636)|
| 3:30:38| that I watched be viciously attacked by a young man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12638)|
| 3:30:40| I attempted to detain him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12640)|
| 3:30:42| and 8 to 10 of his friends threatened me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| to the point I felt that I must unholster my gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| to try to restore order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12646)|
| 3:30:48| I was able to keep the crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12648)|
| 3:30:50| away from and stop their attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12650)|
| 3:30:52| of the woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12652)|
| 3:30:55| I was able to keep them unseen until KPD arrived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12655)|
| 3:30:57| however, as KPD arrived with 8 cruisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12657)|
| 3:30:59| the largest force I've ever seen in Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12659)|
| 3:31:01| I was the one that was disarmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| and placed in the back of the cruiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| allowing the attacker and his 8 to 10 co-conspirators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12665)|
| 3:31:07| to walk away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| one of the conspirators even doubled back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| and talked and made fun jokes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| with the officer as if gloating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| that he was free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12675)|
| 3:31:17| the woman was transported to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12677)|
| 3:31:19| I later learned it was one of my tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12679)|
| 3:31:21| this is the same tenant that's had her life threatened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| this is the third instance of escalation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| of threats towards her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| first they verbally threatened her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| then they walked up to her doors and windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12689)|
| 3:31:31| wrapping on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| just two weeks ago they threw bricks through her windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| I moved her two blocks away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12695)|
| 3:31:37| and now she's been attacked while at the little market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12697)|
| 3:31:39| there's a video surveillance of this attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| and my reaction posted on my Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| it's all public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| I urge everyone to go look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| today I saw the attacker mowing a lawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| here in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12709)|
| 3:31:52| I called 911 at 2.45pm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12712)|
| 3:31:54| I requested the responding officer contact me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12714)|
| 3:31:56| I've yet to be called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12716)|
| 3:31:58| I have no idea if an officer responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| or if that little punk is out on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| causing more mayhem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| this is inexcusable and intolerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12724)|
| 3:32:06| but I'm not here just to bitch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12726)|
| 3:32:08| I'm here to offer some solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12728)|

| 3:32:18| that would like to move into the Mechanicsville neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12738)|
| 3:32:21| I'm pleased to conclude that community policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| is a way to foster a positive environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| between citizens and the police that serve them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| and I've sent an email to Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| outlining the details of this offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| I'm also renewing my offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12751)|

| 3:32:39| last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12759)|

| 3:32:43| and we spent two hours walking the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12763)|
| 3:32:45| and we are now motivated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| and we're working together to assemble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12767)|

| 3:32:55| to discuss the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12777)|
| 3:32:59| and how we might find some better solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12779)|

| 3:34:35| I guess, is that what you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12875)|
| 3:34:38| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12878)|
| 3:34:42| Is that you Mr. Waldrop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12882)|
| 3:34:44| It's me again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12884)|

| 3:35:00| Oh, I'm sorry, I dropped the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12900)|
| 3:35:02| for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12902)|
| 3:35:04| It's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12904)|
| 3:35:06| Yeah, we can sort of barely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12906)|
| 3:35:08| hear you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| at least on my end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12910)|
| 3:35:14| I would just like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12914)|
| 3:35:16| before I start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12916)|
| 3:35:18| original purpose of this call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| I'd like to circle back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12920)|
| 3:35:22| DNC First Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12922)|
| 3:35:24| It's a good question that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12924)|
| 3:35:26| I think we'll see an answer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12926)|
| 3:35:28| what happens to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12928)|
| 3:35:30| later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12930)|
| 3:35:32| That is a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12932)|
| 3:35:35| of a very specific purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| and it's unlikely that just tearing it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| to do something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| is going to be a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| put forward when that building is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| no longer needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12947)|
| 3:35:51| That's definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| a consequence that's going to last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| much longer than that hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| that was for the most part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| the last bit of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| that project will ever receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12961)|
| 3:36:04| I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12964)|
| 3:36:06| intentionally know about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12966)|
| 3:36:08| uselessness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12968)|
| 3:36:10| inefficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12970)|
| 3:36:12| of the Codes and Permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12972)|
| 3:36:14| Reviews Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12974)|
| 3:36:16| I've tried for two years to obtain a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12976)|
| 3:36:18| permit for a house I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12978)|
| 3:36:20| purchased but I've been unable to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12980)|
| 3:36:22| a contractor willing to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12982)|
| 3:36:24| that I didn't sign anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12984)|
| 3:36:26| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12986)|
| 3:36:28| The reason there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12988)|
| 3:36:30| there's no telling what Codes is going to want us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12990)|
| 3:36:32| and we can't give you a price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12992)|
| 3:36:34| I was so unsuccessful in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12994)|
| 3:36:36| that I decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12996)|
| 3:36:38| obtain my own contractor's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=12998)|
| 3:36:40| having an engineering degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13000)|
| 3:36:42| already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13002)|
| 3:36:44| I went and obtained my own contractor's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13004)|
| 3:36:46| and have still had difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13006)|
| 3:36:48| getting a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| It is really disheartening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13010)|
| 3:36:52| to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| there's no information available online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13014)|
| 3:36:56| there's nothing there telling you how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13016)|
| 3:36:58| go about dealing with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13018)|
| 3:37:01| and obtaining a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13021)|
| 3:37:03| In fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| there's even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| the office has only taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13027)|
| 3:37:09| applications by email there's nothing on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13029)|
| 3:37:11| to tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| I had to go all the way down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| the city council building today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| to try again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13037)|
| 3:37:19| to get my permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| only to be greeted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| a telephone that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| 300 buttons on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| and told me to call a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13047)|
| 3:37:30| I could have avoided that trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| and exposing myself and other people to COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13052)|
| 3:37:34| had the website just simply said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| email the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13056)|
| 3:37:38| but it didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13058)|
| 3:37:40| When I got to the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13060)|
| 3:37:42| there were several people ahead of me in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13062)|
| 3:37:44| and they were extremely frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13064)|
| 3:37:46| In fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13066)|
| 3:37:48| as one person in front of me very angrily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| put the phone back on the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13070)|
| 3:37:52| he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13072)|
| 3:37:54| not only are these people unconstituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13074)|
| 3:37:56| but they're unavailable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13076)|
| 3:37:58| A lot of the contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13078)|
| 3:38:00| I've tried to get have said they've done their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13080)|
| 3:38:02| last houses in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13082)|
| 3:38:04| because it's just simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13084)|
| 3:38:06| too difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13086)|
| 3:38:08| If we need affordable housing it comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13088)|
| 3:38:10| small people renovating houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13090)|
| 3:38:12| next to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13092)|
| 3:38:14| or buying up condemned houses and fixing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| not from these large projects that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13096)|
| 3:38:18| costly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13098)|
| 3:38:20| but codes and permit review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13100)|
| 3:38:22| just make it so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13102)|
| 3:38:24| unnecessarily difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13104)|
| 3:38:27| that no one wants to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| or can afford to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| and I would think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| I know we have a lot of other pressing issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| but something to be in the back of the mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| is to reform this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| because it will not be long until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| Knoxville finds itself without any small contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| simply because it is too difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| to do business with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| and I will yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| my rest of the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=13129)|
