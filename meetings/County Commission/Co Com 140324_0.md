| 0:01:25| please. Discussion and possible action against beer permittees that are delinquent in paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| their annual beer privilege tax, Michael Ernest Vineyard, C&C Outdoors, 1122 Concord Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| Off Premises, District 5. Anybody here for the C&C Outdoors? Would you come forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=96)|
| 0:01:44| the podium, please, ma'am? The county clerk's office has sent a notice that you are delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=104)|
| 0:02:01| or the business is delinquent in payment of its beer privilege tax. Do you agree or disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| with that? I agree. Okay. Have you made any effort to pay today up to date that beer privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=127)|
| 0:02:15| tax? Yes. And to what extent? I tried to pay it on Friday. I just have it with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| You do have it with you today? And you can get it to the county court clerk and bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| it up here, maybe. You can meet her out in the hall after this and get that check done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=150)|
| 0:02:38| With respect to that, it's up to the beer board, having been late. What's the, how late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| has she been on this or has the business been? It was due January 31st. Okay. The beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| has the option to revoke or suspend the license for nonpayment of that. However, you've indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| you're going to pay that. And I'll leave it up to the beer board to discuss and determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| what they want to do. Commissioner McKenzie? Just as a question, well, I guess to the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| has this been a historical thing or is this kind of the first year? They were late last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| year also. They paid last year on February 25th. We send out notices December 1st and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| then it's due January 31st and then they were contacted on February 4th and then again later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=208)|
| 0:03:35| by a certified letter. Just, you know, in way of a message to you, these things take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| time and cost. So there's a reason, you know, for it to get to this kind of serious nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| is because instead of doing work that they could be doing, they're dealing with delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| payments. So I'm, you know, I'm really, I'm not for taxing folks or taking away licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| of fining, but if this is a pattern that's going to repeat itself, I think we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| to, you know, I don't know how I'm going to vote today, but I really would encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| to get these payments in timely, December, you know, do it before the New Year's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| because we really don't like to have to deliberate over things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| Does anybody have a motion? We can give them a set amount of time to pay it and suspend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| their license after they don't pay it after that time, or we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| I'll make a motion that they pay it by 5 p.m. today or, I mean, she's got the money, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| I'm not for revoking her license or suspending, I would just say that she needs to pay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| by 5 p.m. today. Can you do that? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Do we have a motion and a second on the floor? All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| The ayes have it. Maybe you'll have to pay that today or the board can take action next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| month on your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Thank you. And if you'll just, the beer meeting won't be long, so if you'll just wait and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| pay the clerk afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=304)|

| 0:09:10| Do you have any questions to present to me or the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Turn it back over to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| How long have you the business is not open now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| How long has it been closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| I believe it closed down on the 1st of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Because I know it was a local hangout for a few of my friends there for coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| I'll make a motion that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| I don't know where they're meeting since January, so you'll have to send out notices, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=585)|

| 0:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| We have a motion and a second to approve based on pending COO from the fire marshal's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=588)|
| 0:09:58| and his certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| Well, he has one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| The permit holder has to be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| You need to get that taken care of before you get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| I have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=609)|

| 0:10:36| Commissioner Brown, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Yeah, I know I left my line on, but I just wanted to remind, I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| We can't hear you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Sir, before you leave, see the young lady on the other end of your bench waving at you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| She has a package that could keep you from coming back up here under adverse circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| and she can also help you in lining up that course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=660)|

| 0:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| The first person on public forum would be Mr. Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Mr. Xavier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| And the next person would be Ms. Mary Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| If you'd come forward, ma'am, and give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| Mary Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Can you pull the mic to you a little bit, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Mary Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| I live at 6334 Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| And my problem is the subdivision that is adjacent to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| It was approved in 2006 to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| And when I came to the meeting to oppose that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| I told them about the storm drainage problem that it was going to cause on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| And I was told that the engineers for R&R Construction Company had already done the assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=762)|
| 0:12:51| and it had been turned in and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Well, subdivision was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Storm water ran onto the property in front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| And it got into my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| It got all the way up to our bedroom window, two feet from our bedroom windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| We had to go in by ourselves, pay $50,000 to have our house rerouted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| so that the water would quit draining from the back and ruining our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| We also had to get rid of a pool because it was right next to their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| and it was considered, what would you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| just a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| The children from the subdivision could come over and get into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| And after all of this happened, they built the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| even though I kept calling and complaining about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| It turns out that the subdivision, which was just a little ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| became Sprattlin' Pond, as I call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| And then after I called complaining about Sprattlin' Pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| because of all the mosquitoes and the algae and the grass that was growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| that was making it impossible to keep it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| finally, after a lot of arguing going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| they decided that they would come back and fill it in and fix it with dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| And that was going to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| So I let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| Well, Sprattlin' Pond then became Sprattlin' Swamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| Water's still coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Water's coming onto my property, not as far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| It's coming six feet onto my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| It has ruined my grandchildren's play gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| And finally, after a lot of fighting and arguing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| we came to an agreement that the Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| would come in and fix the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| because the $5 million bond that R&R Construction put down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| to build this subdivision was given back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| So you are now left, or Knox County is now left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| with an entire subdivision that is out of code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| because they did not put in sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| and they did not put in a turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| which was required by the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| in order for the cars to come in and out of the property safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| We have a lot of problems with people coming out of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| and into the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| and trying to cut us off when we're trying to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| So after all this was brought to their attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| and obviously they didn't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| that they were out of code violation or in code violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| they have allowed two more lots to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| There are two more houses that have gone up since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Now, if it was me and that was my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| that had committed the problem that was the swamp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| I would have been in code violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| and I would have been made to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| This place has been out of code violation since 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| and nobody's done anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| and nobody's caused them to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Well, R&R went in and filed for bankruptcy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| which leaves Knox County responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| I want to know what you're going to do about my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| who are in code violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| and who know it, as one of my neighbors grinned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| and told me on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| and are proud of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| because you've allowed them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| And who have you spoken with at Knox County in the engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Well, let's see. I spoke to Dwight Kessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| And Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| And Jim Snowden's the one that I've worked with very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| They and I have a relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| and that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Mr. Snowden has been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| They have hired a fleet with Campbell Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| to come in and survey it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| They have come up with a plan that they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| is going to cause the runoff to stop coming onto our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| I said, okay, try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Could you leave your name and phone number with Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| Will you leave your name and phone number with Ms. Jolie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| so I can get back with you and meet with Jim for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Okay, but I have one more thing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| During all this, while I was hiring my own engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| to do survey on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| at least two of them, after I had hired them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| and they started going to KIG, looking on the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| were threatened with their jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| and if they did anything, they would lose their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| They would make sure that they would not have any income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| And it did come from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| I called the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| and I spoke to his two assistants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| because he was too busy to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and they never called me back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| because they're not going to admit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| to what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| And I think somebody needs to do something about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| because that is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| If you'll leave your name and phone number with her, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| I'll get in contact with you and meet with Jim with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1125)|

| 0:19:07| as soon as she comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| She is on her way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Is there anything else on public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Do you want to go ahead and do yours, Dr. Burke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| No, we'll have to vote on it before we do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Really, the commission meeting doesn't start, I guess, until 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| We're going to move the resolution that we have up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Yeah, I'll take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1168)|
| 0:19:39| So I guess we'll stand in recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=1179)|

| 0:37:49| the Gold Star Families Memorial Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| The idea of a highway memorializing the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| originated with the well-known Gold Star Mothers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| and these are the mothers of our fallen warrior heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| I want to tell you briefly about two of my heroes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| that have origins in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| The first is Sergeant Joseph Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Joey was the only son and a big brother to two sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| He was known for his big smile and his bigger heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| Joey joined the Tennessee National Guard before 9-11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| and had no idea he would ever end up in Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| He was killed when two anti-tank mines detonated under his vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| He leaves behind two sons, Caleb and Joshua.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| Ryan McGee grew up listening to stories of his relatives' military service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| He played high school football in Virginia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| and on graduating high school knew one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| he wanted to be an Army Special Operations soldier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| After graduating from Airborne and Ranger School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Ryan had four deployments to the war zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| including three in Afghanistan and one in Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| On the fourth deployment, he was killed in action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| in a firefight on May 13, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| We have a distinct and rare privilege today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| to have Joey's American Gold Star Mother, Marcia Hunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| and would you please come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| and also Gold Star Mother, Sherry McGee of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| the mother of Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| You will note that the Gold Star Mothers have a tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| of dressing in white as an honor to their fallen sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And I believe Mayor Burchett at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| has a presentation that he would like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| If it would be appropriate if all of our veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| would come stand with these ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| That's a crowd, too, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| You can stay on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I have a proclamation on behalf of my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| to honor the Gold Star Mothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| It's a lot of words, a lot of verbiage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| but basically Dr. Briggs has pretty much said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| everything that needed to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| I just want to thank these mothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| My grandmother was a Gold Star Mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| as you all well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| My mama lost a brother, Roy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| and I can remember as a little boy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| going to Neyland Stadium to watch the balls play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| and they'd play the National Anthem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| and Mama would swell up with tears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| and I knew what it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| It was about her brother, Roy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| that never came home from the Second World War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| So we owe you all very much a debt of gratitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| And paper's cheap, lives are expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| and your boys gave the ultimate sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| so we could live in a free nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| And I want to say thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2460)|

| 0:41:31| Thank you so much for honoring the Gold Star families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| and it's not just mothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| It's fathers, brothers, sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| When we lose one, it affects so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| With that said, the mission of our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| the American Gold Star Mothers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2504)|

| 0:41:49| and fallen heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2509)|

| 0:41:54| in West Tennessee suggested that we should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| a highway, route, or road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2517)|

| 0:42:04| Cindy Tatum, took this idea and brought it to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| Cindy has become the core of this drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2528)|

| 0:42:19| State Route 1 was chosen as a route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| to be designated to bear the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2542)|

| 0:42:31| of contacting Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| and initiating communication needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| to support this drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Our great state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| became known as the Volunteer State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| beginning with Davy Crockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| and the Volunteer Army at the Alamo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| all the way to World War I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2568)|

| 0:43:01| into battle to defend our nation's freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2581)|

| 0:43:05| has many fallen heroes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| and therefore Gold Star families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| It is only fitting to name a state route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| that starts from one end of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| and goes to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Starting from the Tennessee-Arkansas line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| in Memphis to Bristol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=2597)|

| 0:54:59| Commissioner Olinby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you, Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| First, the reason I brought this forward is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| I had several phone calls from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| several people asking me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| to bring this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| this basically is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| a letter and we do this several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| many different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| on different things that we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| basically give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| our legislative body know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| where our thinking is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| and what our citizens are thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| and several citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| said they support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| and basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| of having an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| a lot of copies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| in y'all's mailbox about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| proton therapy and how it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| when it was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| it was first developed back in the 1950s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| really started getting some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| funding around 1990| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| and there's been roughly 73,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| that have went through proton therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| from the research that I pulled up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| proton therapy is still chemotherapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| a form of chemotherapy but it's less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| intrusive, it's more pinpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| affect the cells around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| the cancerous that it's killing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| where chemotherapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| is more broader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| intrusive, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| I mean that's one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| less time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| that they spend in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| doing this therapy than it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| chemotherapy as a longer process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| from what patients have told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| and what I've read about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| and I'm no doctor by any stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| the patients, the people I've talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| that actually want to do this therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| was in the newspaper article that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| children are covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| but 19 to 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| aren't covered by their insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| and Medicaid will reimburse anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| 65 or older that has proton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| therapy. All this bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| is going to do is say we need to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| the 19 to 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| these people so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| other states around us, Georgia, Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| their insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| covers this so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| it's something, it's not a Republican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| thing, it's not a Democratic thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| I believe it's the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| and I support the Senate and the House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| bills for this and I would ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| the Commission do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you Mr. Chairman. I had an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| contact me and ask if I would support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| and I told them over the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| that I would and the reason that I said that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| is because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| had attended a presentation on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| proton therapy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| they had talked about the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| and they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| two people there who had undergone proton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| therapy and both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| had talked about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| results they had received and were very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| very positive about the results they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Today we were handed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| document showing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| the controversy that's raging in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Nashville seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| to be over a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| between the owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| the owners of proton therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| here in Knoxville, what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| ultimate goal may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| and of course they're talking about financial gain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| etc. etc. I don't know anything about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| I've never met the owners, I've never met the investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| I don't know who these people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| But it does say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| document that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| we believe that proton therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| is one of the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| available therapies but it does go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| to say it has not been shown it provides any better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| outcomes than less expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| procedures. It also goes on to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| proton therapy has its place in the treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| of prostate cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| But then it goes on to say that mandating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| coverage does not seem to be in the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| of medicine. I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| everything that goes on in the insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| world and I'm certainly not a doctor either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| but it seems to me that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| the statement is made that proton has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| its place in the treatment of prostate cancer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| then why would there not be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| option for some type of medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| coverage between those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| persons ages 19 to 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| So I don't want to get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| in the controversy that seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| going on in Nashville between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| going on between the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| and the investors. My concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| is for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| who want an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| and the option is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| proton therapy, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| they feel that's the best option for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| then should there not be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| consideration by the insurance companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| to provide it because even the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| document here says it is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| So I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| a question and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| I hate to ask the law director because you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| an insurance person either. I don't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| know the ins and outs of all this. It just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| seems to me logically that if I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| cancer and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| talked with my doctor about all of the available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| remedies and all of the available options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| and an option is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| to me and I feel that proton is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| the best for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| and I can't afford it without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| losing my house and leveraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| everything I've got then should there not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| some type of insurance coverage for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| That's the only question that I'm asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| and that's what I'm grappling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| is I don't want to insert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| myself into a controversy that's raging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| in Nashville over this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| but it just seems to me that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| there is an agreement that this is an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| then why would we not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| to make it an option with the insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I don't have the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I'm just saying that this is what I'm grappling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| Yes, sir. Commissioner Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| I had called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| David earlier and asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| him to look up something for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| and David, did you have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| answer on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Commissioner, you'd ask what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| status was on the bill, House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| and Senate bill in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| and it was to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| it got deferred from committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| hearings last week. It's now set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| for committee hearings, both the Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| subcommittee, I think it's Commerce and Insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Committee in the Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| for this week and the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| in the House. They've got parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| subcommittee hearings going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| and that's all I could find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| out about it. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| has not come out of subcommittee yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Okay. Well, the reason I had asked was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| because, and you all have heard me say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| this before, I really dislike it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| when something is added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| at the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| and we are asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| consider it and vote on it without being given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| enough time to do any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| of due diligence or proper research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| on it. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| that was my concern. I'm normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| very much against that, but since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| this is coming up to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| debated in the next week, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| really important that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| and move forward on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| asked, contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| and requested to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| added as a co-sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| I've done a great deal of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| I haven't seen what Jeff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| put in our boxes, but I did a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| of research on my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| since I heard about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| over the weekend and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| what I've discovered is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| in terms of financial incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| for the person who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| financing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| I am not interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| in that. I will say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| for the urologists, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| also have a financial incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| in removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| prostates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| So I think that that argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| cuts both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| I also would like to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| what we're talking about is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| a form of radiation treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| and it is covered by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| From the latest research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| and the research I looked at, I went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| several years, but I also looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| what's just been published in the past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| and what I've discovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| is that current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| treatments, most current treatments for prostate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| cancer involve either removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| of prostate or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| and perhaps in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| with some type of chemotherapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| and the traditional radiation treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| when you're looking at 10-year outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| from people who've had traditional radiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| therapy versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| the proton therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| currently it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| like the 10-year outcomes are about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| same. However, the big difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| for me looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| treatments are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| accepted treatments, which are the removal of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| prostate or the traditional radiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| therapies that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| often result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| incontinence and impotence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Those do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| seem to be as common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| side effects of proton therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Now, it's covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| for people with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Medicare, so we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| about people who are over age 65,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| but if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| develops prostate cancer in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| 20s, 30s, 40s, or 50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| even if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| outcome within 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3873)|

| 1:04:37| about the quality of their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Do they want to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| to go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| bathroom when they need to? Not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Do they want to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| be impotent or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| Those are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| quality of life issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| this is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| our private insurance companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| should be required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| cover for that reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| alone, even if it turns out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| the 10-year outcome is not that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| difference. The quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| in those 10 years is of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| critical importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| to the young men in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| So that's why I asked for my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| name to be added to this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| and I support it. And I also say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| I often have problems with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| budding into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| state business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| unless we're specifically asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| or unless it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| directly affects what's going on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| in Knox County, but this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| where I think it is both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| appropriate and right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| that we give them this feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| And I hope that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| will join us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| in supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| I had a call from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| a friend of mine that's a urologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| and in deference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Mr. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| and his measure and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| intent with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| urologist is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| obviously concerned about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| discussion and in reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| the treatment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| that we have treatments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| that have proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| to be as effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| or equally effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| as proton therapy, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| those three treatments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| are, treatment options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| are much less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| His concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| and I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| I guess I agree with this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| of the tact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| that has been taken by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| the proton therapy group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| certainly has involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| quite a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| public relations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| advertisement, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| And so when I see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| take place, I'm immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| a little bit concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| about, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| this treatment option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| recognizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| it's probably ten times as expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| as the options that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Also realizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| this is a very highly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| expensive proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| to, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| fund this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| facility, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| those things make me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| I do feel for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| that have the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| and would like to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| option, I think that's a reasonable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| But I don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| especially reasonable for us, given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| to, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| under the advice of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| people in the profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| the community of urologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| scientists, doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| that treat this condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| There's just question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| And so, just based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| that, I think that I will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| I think I'll just pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| And we'll let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| the people in Nashville wrestle with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Jeff, you may. From what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| the current bill with amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| exempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| TennCare and state insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| Apologize. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| My understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| people I've talked to, that once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| other insurance companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| offer this, that the state will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| come along usually a year or so later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| No guarantee on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| So the bill exempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| the state employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| and TennCare currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| That's kind of one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Other than the fact of the other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| that's one of the things that bother me about the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| is it's not good for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| It's just good for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| With the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| information that it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| a new item for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| I'll offer up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| to put it off a month as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| substitute motion until more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| information is gained, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| otherwise I won't be able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| I'll offer that up as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4173)|

| 1:09:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Like Commissioner Burroughs, I was concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| with the timeliness of it, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Commissioner Ormey was right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| the fact that we need to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| in front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4187)|

| 1:15:19| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| We haven't met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| We've been attempting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| get our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| facilitated meeting put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| Looks like it's going to be April 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| I'm going to look to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Hammond. I think he's the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Oh, that's good for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Looks like we will be meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| April 24 at 430| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| at the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| We've not met since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| I guess at that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| we will be discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| whether we go forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| facilitation, there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| county tax dollars involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| payment of the facilitator. He was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| paid, or his company was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| paid. So whether we go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| or just us, I think we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Commissioner Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| did a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| We can move on that way. But that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| going to be a major part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| of our discussion. There's several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| things still on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| board for us to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Things like property and titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| Again, just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| try to discuss some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| We'll continue the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| Work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| teacher evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Get some more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4603)|

| 1:16:47| administration and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Discuss that further, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| whatever. Budgets coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| There will be a lot of things for us to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| what I'm looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| the seven of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| if you all could give us input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| as to whether you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| what you're hearing as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| of downloads from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| joint committee. I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| several of you are looking at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| It comes on at various times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| If you want this thing to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I think the four of us are in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| of this continuing. I don't want to speak for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| three. I know I am. I'll publicly say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| I am in favor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| continuing in some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| If you have any strong feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| on either side, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| let us know. That's really all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| I'll look to the other committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| interested in continuing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| But I wanted to point out the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| that I don't know if we're going to meet during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| my last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| is August as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| So it may be that after this last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| facilitated that I probably need to step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| down or wait until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| new commission comes on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| I'll leave it up to you folks. I'm happy to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| until August, but after August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| But if someone wanted to come on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| and go through that process, I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| willing to step down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| after the last facilitated meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| There may be some new school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| members too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| So maybe we go and wait until after the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| and then we can reconstitute that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| discussion on that? Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| I want to reinforce what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Commissioner McKenzie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| There are two things before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Reconstitution, that's not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| important as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| the major thing is the topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| We need discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| here at commission about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| might be important or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| might be coming back that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| disseminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| It may very well be that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| continue on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| not doing anything maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| during the summer months and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| look at how new commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| feels we ought to go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| doing this. In any event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| it's the subject matter that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| some discussion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| And to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| point, Mr. Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| the school system seems to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| some point of emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| at this time to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| property issues and titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| I would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| like for the committee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| keep their eye on the ball really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| The ball is the subject's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| education. The subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| is teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| I think that's the central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| and core issue and I would hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| that you wouldn't be diverted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| towards real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| All right. Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4801)|

| 1:20:07| Been killed. I believe that, yeah, the bill's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| been killed so we don't need to have any discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Amy added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| a salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| Is Knox County's most eligible bachelor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Y'all got a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| of the picture, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| You did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| You did very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Have you got any updates for us, Chris, on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Talked to Allison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| today and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| Sheriff Jones will go to participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| agencies today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| and then next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| we followed up with a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| and survey from Dr. Lu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| And so that's how the process will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| It will probably take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| four to six weeks to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| And talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| Allison, there's no way we'll be able to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| that in the budget for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| my fiscal year is correct, because they won't be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| in time. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| what we'll do is once they get their results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| then we'll look to see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Kind of like it happened with ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| When we did the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| county, it was after the budget. And so I think it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| become the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Chris, one other quick question before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| And this has to kind of, it's kind of related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| What are we looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| timetable-wise on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| I know you don't have specific dates, but can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| kind of give us where you are in the process now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| and what you foresee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| maybe a timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| Yeah, I'll probably start on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| mayor will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| present the budget May the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| I think it's already been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| the chairman has tentatively set the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| date for either the 5th or the 9th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| I think it was going to wait to see which one works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| better for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| the members of commission. And then there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| a tentative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| public forum date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| before that, a week or so before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| I can't remember the date off my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| So basically what we're doing now as a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| is we're going through the process looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| at expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| The mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| and the chief of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| and myself and my department has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| meeting with departments and going over their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| budget request and what they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| be able to expect and what not to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| And so we're just basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| in the middle of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| We'll wait until we get one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| month of sales tax before we finalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| sales tax and revenue as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| To give us one more month of property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| The later we can wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| to analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| revenue, the better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| we will feel about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Expenditures are pretty much a constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| So we look at those to see where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| we can get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| We're right on schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| I think my goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| is always to be done about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| of April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| to be able to finalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| our reports to be able to hand out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| a fluid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| The mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| and myself will meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| three times a week if not more to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| certain things on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| It's fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Chairman, let me ask one question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| I guess it's directed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Chairman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Meeting next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Annual meeting or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| I knew there was something that I meant to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| But yes, there is a cable television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| on next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| is that Wednesday? April 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| And we're actually going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| meet at Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| Russell and I have been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| trying to, that way we can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| their operations. They have a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| set up for us. We can see the front end, see the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Can you schedule the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| between 2 and 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| That's the way they do us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| There will be a window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| But all are invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Please, all commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| this is an open meeting, so they're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| Hopefully it won't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| it can't take hundreds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| We have a couple of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| And I just thought it would be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| opportunity for us to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| to the first district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| right next to Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| It's a stone's throw across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| It's on Ashford Highway, the old Kmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| building. So they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| have a sign or something, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| a door that we'll go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| 4 o'clock. It starts at 4pm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| on April 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Between 4 and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Yeah, that's right. Anytime in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140324_201810?start=5115)|
