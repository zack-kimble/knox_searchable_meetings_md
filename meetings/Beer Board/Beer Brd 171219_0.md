| 0:01:39| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| It used to end at Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| I'm at the end of the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=101)|

| 0:01:54| Anyway, applicants who are approved pending final documentation need to bring those documentation to the business tax office during regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=114)|
| 0:02:03| Applicants who have their permit approved tonight can pick up their permit at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| You can see Mark Bird down here at the end and Donna Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| Also, you see them at the end of the meeting if you approve final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| Also, for anything that we postpone tonight, we'll save the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| So if you'll just pass your paperwork over to Will and pass it down to Donna on that side, and we'll save it going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=142)|

| 0:02:52| And Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| We need the building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and the health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=179)|

| 0:03:20| I make a motion to approve, and thank you for coming to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| The motion is that it's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| It's a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=216)|

| 0:03:40| I hope it goes well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Next up is Da Vinci's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| So let me just say while he's coming there, if it's in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| we usually try to give you all the first option to make that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| or ask the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| So in this case, it's in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| So, Gwen, if you want that, you don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| but that's kind of been our standing rule, so we'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Da Vinci's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Yes, sir, your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Raphic Hanna, 113 South Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Sergeant Cowher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Ms. Donner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| I need the copy of your sales tax registration, your certificate of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| your plan for server compliance, and the fire prevention approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| and also the surrender of the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| What can you tell us about Da Vinci's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| It's one of the best pizzas in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Best pizza in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Serve cold beer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| According to the current business license, the expiration is 5-5-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| So what would be the new expiration date if they're approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Sergeant, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| They will apply annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| So when that expiration comes up, they will apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| I mean, they should apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| That's the standard protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| All the business licenses are only a year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| So they're renewable every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| This one says the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=313)|
| 0:05:24| The reason why I'm questioning that is the last one for Central Cinema| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| has an expiration date of 5-15-2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| It just means he's already filed this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| He hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| He already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| But they have time to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| First stop, discount tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| Mr. Byrd, do you have a comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| They are requesting a deferral until January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| So we deferred them once, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| It's not that uncommon to defer these a couple times to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| They're waiting on the background check on an owner, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=383)|

| 0:06:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| So you'd like a motion to defer for one meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| I'll make a motion to defer to the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=394)|

| 0:07:05| and the permit from the prior owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=425)|

| 0:07:44| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| Peter Fitzgerald, Kaleah Storr and Moore, 5901 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Sgt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=473)|

| 0:07:56| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| We need the fire prevention and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| Peter, what can you tell us about Kaleah Storr and Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| It's a brand new operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| We only opened yesterday, and it's a small convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Small convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Are you familiar with it, Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| I know the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| I think that there hasn't been a permit at this location previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| What's your plan for server compliance at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| We will use driver's licenses to comply with the regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| and check each purchaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| What kind of training for your employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| There's only my wife and I, and we intend to keep that as such for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Are there typically any other requirements for server compliance that would go beyond that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| I guess this is you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Well, plans of server compliance, it's kind of how they meet the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| Carting somebody is the absolute minimum that's required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| Some places, depending on their size, they have different steps that they'll put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| that what might be appropriate for a large location might be inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| or not necessary for a small location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Some places, some convenience stores will get scanning devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| that scan the code on the back of the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| It will help spot fake IDs, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| It will confirm somebody's date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| There are also programs for cash registers and the point-of-sale systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| where dates of birth can be entered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| and the clerk will be alerted whether or not that person is 21 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| But it's somewhat subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| It sounds like this is a pretty small operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Would you like to make a motion to approve this pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| I make a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=608)|

| 0:10:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Rosini Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=624)|

| 0:10:42| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| We usually have a balloon drop for those that have a file complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Well, not tonight, but next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| But, Don, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Tell us a little bit about the Rosini Festival coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| It's our 40th anniversary, so 17th anniversary of the start of the Rosini Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| so it's a big year for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| And we're going to do something completely unusual at the festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| and present some music from Verdi's Aida in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| So it's going to be quite exceptional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| So do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=679)|

| 0:11:23| A motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=683)|

| 0:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| SWB Holding, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Patrick King, 312 Suffolk Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Sergeant Cowher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| We need the copy of your sales tax registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| and the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| I'd like to ask you about your plan for server compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Given the size of the area that you're planning to locate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| how do you plan on dealing with leftover beer and bussing tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=724)|
| 0:12:13| and making sure that minors aren't getting served any alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| So, obviously, we will card every customer that comes to purchase beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| We also are working within the Simon Mall food court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| and so there are staff that are in that, custodial staff that are in that food court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| that are always bussing tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| So they will be providing support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| We will also be serving our beer in branded glassware so that it's transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| and it also will have the SawWorks brand name on that glassware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| so that it's easily identifiable and easily seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| You know, this kiosk is centrally located within the food court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| so it will be easy 360-degree views of the food court to be able to monitor that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| with our staff that will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| We will have two staff there so that we will have one that's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| to actually bus the tables and provide added support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| for the custodial staff that's there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| In addition to that, there are two points of access to this food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| And so, obviously, there are security personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| hired personnel there by Simon that are monitoring the mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| and the food court in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| The other thing that we are actually, Simon is actually providing the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| They're going to put up signage as well at those two points of entry to the food court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| that indicates that no alcohol will be beyond that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| And that staff does have training with drugs and alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| and how to, you know, identify that and enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| And so they also will be providing that support as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| in the event that, you know, somebody were to go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| That's even people of a legal drinking age, if they happen to have a glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| obviously, if they go beyond that point, they will be enforcing people taking it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| and ensuring, obviously, that people that aren't supposed to be drinking aren't drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| And your plan is that there's no separation between the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| where the bar is located in the middle of the food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Anyone could pick up a drink and then move anywhere in the food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Just within the premises of the food court, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Will there be personnel at the exits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| And I believe there is an exit that leads directly into the parking lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| That is true, yeah, that they do have an exit there at the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Again, yeah, we'll have security personnel that's monitoring the food court there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| Yeah, that's provided by Simon's security staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Okay, we'll start with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Okay, hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Let's go to Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| No, no, Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| I'm used to reading the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Go ahead, Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| I am very uncomfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| There is just really no limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| There's no barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| There's no indicator of where the limits are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| and it's reliant totally on Simon and not you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| I'm very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I can't support this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| This is kind of out of bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| So I would recommend that we deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| He can certainly reapply if that's supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| but it's got to come with a lot more, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| a lot more boundaries in the application and ways to enforce our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=931)|
| 0:15:41| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| There is precedent in this food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Well, but that was ten years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| and that has not been the case then, and it was a whole lot different then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| As we all know, parents take their children down there and let them loose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| and come pick them up in a couple of hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| and I'm just not willing with what you've described to approve an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| that's this loose right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| And I concur with remarks by Councilman Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| but I also wanted to follow up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Are you stating to us that Simon Mall is going to hire security staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| to monitor the entry points and the exit door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Well, I'm saying that the existing security personnel that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| they'll provide that monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| So I don't know that they'll add additional staff for our kiosk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| but what I mean is they have security personnel that's there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| And I get that, but they're also monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| They're responsible for the entire mall, the parking area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| And so if they're not committing to additional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| that's going to monitor because this is a totally new dynamic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| that we would be introducing into the mall area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| and we do have a lot of teenagers and underage young people that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| And so I agree that I'm not comfortable with the current setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| I'd like to call on Attorney Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| You have some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| We met and discussed this location back on November 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| and since that time I've conferred with both the police chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| and even spoke with the law director today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| In the present application under Chapter 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| it doesn't have a premise in terms of Chapter 4 of the Beer Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| and as it's presently proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| we respectfully submit that it's nothing that the Beer Board can approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| in its present condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Sergeant Caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Myself and Captain Jones with the police department met with mall management today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| and discussed the plans for the property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| and we have explained to them what they would need to do to be in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| in order to get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| And if you would like to meet with me afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| I'd be willing to discuss things with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| But as of now, the mall people conveyed to us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| they do not have a finalized architectural rendering of the place yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| and they have not begun construction on the place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1113)|
| 0:18:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| I guess the question is then should we postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| or would it be a whole different permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| And is this something that the applicant is looking to pursue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| Sorry, clarify what you mean by looking to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Well, I guess were you at this meeting this afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| No, he was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| What I guess we're proposing that would be possibly amenable to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| is actually postpone it until we get final renderings of the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| and that way we can ascertain whether or not it does meet the ordinance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| of a premises and then go forward with the approval of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1169)|
| 0:19:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Councilman McKenzie, you still got your line on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Do you want to talk some more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| So what are you recommending, Mr. Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Well, if there's sort of a path that the police department is comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| I'm okay with postponing it until they meet those provisions laid out by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1198)|
| 0:20:08| And if they don't, I guess we could just deny it in a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| I don't know what Beer Board wants to do, but rather than making them refile it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1211)|
| 0:20:22| Yeah, I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| I think we're certainly open because we're very, very concerned about making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| we can enforce it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Obviously, looking at the fact that there's been precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| that seems to me to be a, you know, this isn't an entirely new concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| particularly in this food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| But that said, if it's something that this Beer Board is not comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| one way or the other, we believe in the idea, and I know Simon does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| They were going to be here, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Their representative got held up in Atlanta because of what happened yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| so he's hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| But I do know that they're in support of this project one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| So if there is a way that we need to designate the premises in a more defined way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| I know that they're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| And, you know, we've come up with some hypotheticals, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| about what that could possibly look like, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| We can come up with something that's more of a defined architectural plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Do you want to put that into motion, Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| I'd move to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Would you need two months or three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| No, we could do it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| That was what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| In keeping with the spirit of the district representatives making the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| if you want to make the motion to postpone it, I'll be happy to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| How much time do you feel you need to make the amendments necessary to define the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| I think 30 days is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| By next month's beer board meeting, I think we could have what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Then I make a motion that we delay for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| So we're postponing this for 30 days, the motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| It's postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Is that one no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| So let's just save this paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1337)|

| 0:24:41| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| My name is Leonora Martin and the address is 4705 Central Avenue Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1491)|

| 0:24:54| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| We need the permit from the existing owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| The permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| That, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Tell us about your place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| It's a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| We give service for the Hispanic community mostly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| And what happened is that I had two buildings, one next to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| but times were getting too tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| so we decided to move the store and the restaurant together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| Now we're applying to sell beer on the building next to where the store used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| But it's the same area and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Mr. Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Motion to approve once she hands over the old permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| So, she's got it with her tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| So, motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| You can pick it up after the meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| That's the regular list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Now we'll go to the addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Mr. Frost, would you like to tell us what we have in front of us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| When someone is approved pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| the ordinances allow them 90 days to get their premises open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| They have all their paperwork done, all their inspections have been completed and passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| Those applicants that are on this addendum to the Beer Board Hearing Agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| were approved pending final documentation at an earlier date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| and they were not able to get everything done within that 90-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| So, at this point, they're supposed to come back to the Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| and give a little explanation of why hasn't something been done in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| and then ask for additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Sometimes people will come back on more than one occasion asking for additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Sometimes it's granted it's not an automatic thing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| So that's this part of the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| So we have several in front of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| We'll call them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Please come up and state your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Amigos and Beer at 7228 Regents Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| Is anyone here from Amigos and Beer, Regents Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| Have you heard from them, Mr. Burr or Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| We spoke with them on the 18th and we did send certified mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| and let them know that they should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| The file is subject to final documentation at the September 26, 2017 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| File needs building, fire, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Our options are to deny it or we can refer it for one month or any longer, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1670)|
| 0:27:59| What's the pleasure of the Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| To extend it another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| If no action is taken, if nobody says anything, it just dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| If it dies, then they have to re-permit or reapply and re-fee and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Mr. Chairman, you might also explain how long the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| and the various fingerprint checks and so forth last before they have to be done again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| Well, the task class lasts a year and fingerprints at this point have no expression on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| So this is really whether they may send District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| I don't know if you've ever been by there, Lauren, or know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| Generally, I would say in the past we've given them grace and extended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| And if they don't show up two meetings in a row, then I think that would be our message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Is this the first meeting they haven't shown up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Well, I can make a motion that we extend it for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| And the thing is if these applicants in this intervening 30-day period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| if they go and get all of their things checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| they'll be given their beer permit on the spot and they won't reappear here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| So a motion to extend Amigos and Beer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| They're extended for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171219?start=1773)|
