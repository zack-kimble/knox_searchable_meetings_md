| 0:00:23| How you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=23)|

| 0:00:26| I hope all commissioners have a copy of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=26)|
| 0:00:32| They're handing them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=32)|
| 0:00:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=34)|
| 0:00:41| I have one addition to the library board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=41)|
| 0:00:48| It's a Tennessee State Library Archives grant that needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Oh, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=61)|
| 0:01:19| Go ahead, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| I'd like to add to honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| I had several of the office holders here and skipped over one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=87)|
| 0:01:35| Commissioner Moore would appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| We need to also honor John Whitehead as serving as a property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| I'd like to add that since his term will be up at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| You had another one quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| I don't have a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| I just want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| I mean, another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Yes, and I'm not sure if this needs to be a discussion item or how to hold this appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| But with regard to the commission forum, I think that since this is kind of a learning curve that we're going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=126)|
| 0:02:15| and we're going to be working out some of the kinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| one of the concerns I have is with regard to when we post on the commission forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| that somehow we're notified to check that either a little text message sent to our phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| or something sent to a BlackBerry because, you know, I don't live on the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| And so I'm not constantly checking that to see if there's anything that anybody has added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| or has any sort of wants us to comment on or any concerns that we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| But there needs to be some sort of process in place that especially if there is an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| or we need to hold an emergency meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| I think that there needs to be some sort of procedure or process in place that we're notified somehow to check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| And I don't know if that needs to be a discussion item, if we need to talk to the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| if we need to talk to IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| I don't know if that needs to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| Can you help me, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| I would think that we would probably need John in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| The only thing I know we can do is that message board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| I think we all probably just be more mindful to look at it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| But I know we definitely need John in on any texting and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Well, I didn't know if there was a way that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| I know that the ruling where Jolie called folks was kind of outside the scope of what was allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| But, I mean, just a text that simply says, you know, please look at the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| I don't see how that can be construed as a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| Never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| I thought what Jolie did was okay, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Apparently not, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| She made the front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| That's not hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| I've made the front page a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| But, yeah, I just wanted to comment on sending the messages to text or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=246)|
| 0:04:15| This is a board that's in its infancy, and only a few people are using it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| I think there's, what, about five of us that are using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| I think I posted once, so I would probably be a fairly light user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| But the thing is, is that as these people get used to these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| I've been involved in forums that, granted, had more than 19 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| but, you know, if you got a text message every time somebody posted on some of the forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| that I've been members of, man, it'd be in constant, you know, constantly be in text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| I think maybe some sort of daily or some, I think some sort of an emergency situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| And I don't see what, of course, here I am stepping out on a limb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| but I can't see that the chancellor would have a problem with Jolie calling us up in an emergency situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=302)|
| 0:05:10| and saying there's something on the forum you may want to see because I just can't see that being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=310)|
| 0:05:19| because you're not telling them, giving them any information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| You're just telling them to go to the forum to see the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| Well, I guess, Commissioner Lambert, following up with that sentiment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| if the chancellor did rule we could call and say, Commissioner Pinkston or Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| can you meet at this time and date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| I don't see how that's different than saying, Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| there's something on the board you might want to go read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| I think it's, to me, that seems pretty equal as far as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| But I did have something else I would like to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| It has to do with our late night meetings or meetings that go that late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| And I'm not sure if we want to address it this month or next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| but I'm thinking that we may need to have the rules committee maybe meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| and possibly think about a time that in order to continue on we would have to take a two-thirds vote to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| So if we had made a rule that, just throw a number out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| say that the commission meeting must at 11 o'clock end its meeting and re-adjourn, say, at 9 o'clock the next day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=387)|
| 0:06:36| that no business can be conducted after that, of course, if that's a rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| we can then do away with our rules with a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| So I'm not sure that we're doing the public a lot of good by holding meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| after a lot of them have already gone to bed and the media is not here covering it necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| It is on TV for those that are suffering from insomnia or just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=418)|
| 0:07:07| So I'm thinking that, you know, and I just wanted to throw it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| and see what other commissioners thought of the idea that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| if we're going to go beyond a certain time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| I could say if we've got one or two items left and we think they're going to be done in the next five, ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| then, you know, we may say, you know, vote on the rules to do away with the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| which takes a two-thirds vote, and then we could finish the business on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| But if we go beyond, I mean, you know, we're going 1.30 or I'm not sure that that's doing the issue that we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=455)|
| 0:07:44| a lot of good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| And I know that we're doing Knox County and the people of Knox County a lot of good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| by continuing our meetings to the wee hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| And so I just wanted to throw that out there and see what other commissioners thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| see what kind of direction they would like to go with something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| or continue on with the way we're doing and we'll finish our business whatever hour it takes to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| Looking at the agenda for this month, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| This month, you know, we might be in and out of here as soon as we finish zonings, you know, maybe at 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| But I'm just thinking if there's a rule in place and if we get to whatever that hour is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| and we could decide at that point if we wanted to suspend the rules and continue on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| or if we still look at it and say, God, we've still got hours here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| We still have a couple of controversial issues to get to that maybe it wouldn't be best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| if we just came back the next morning instead of trying to, you know, discuss these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| and the wee hours and everybody's already been here for seven, eight, nine hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| And are we doing justice to the important issues that are coming before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=536)|
| 0:09:04| Well, you're going to put that on the agenda to discuss and we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| Well, I can have that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| I don't know that we need to vote, but I was just thinking before we do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| I think we'd need to go before the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Right, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Send it to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| I didn't know if you wanted to do that today or if we have to have a vote of the regular commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| to send something like that on to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Commissioner Pinkston, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| I think you have to send it to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| I mean, I know we have to send it to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| We'd have to send it, but I don't know if this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| if the chairman can just go ahead and send that on or is that something that we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| I think the chairman can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Okay, I'm going to grant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| As long as it's sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| We have a couple of others that need to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| A human resource, a grant from Cigna Healthcare, and also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=599)|
| 0:10:12| This is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=612)|
| 0:10:29| To be added, a transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| Well, let me just read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Let it be resolved by the North County Commission to hold two public hearings for politicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| landowners, developers, and the public to understand the transfer of development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| before they are to be implemented, adopted, accepted, or furthermore used in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| That's another one to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Yeah, I was just going to ask Victoria, what is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Okay, we were at a public meeting last evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| and this is coming up for MPC for this Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| and then it will be subject to county commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| When we asked Mark Donaldson if this had ever been used before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| he was not very direct in saying that it's ever been used in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| so I'm not sure if it has or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| So I did a little bit of research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| and there's another document that I had faxed here just a few moments ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| and I'm going to bring that down in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| But this fax sheet is from Ohio State University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| and it's about the transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| It's not a new concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| It's actually applied in seven states have instituted this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| and actually seven states have statutes specific for this for farmland protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| It's also been used in New York City, in a variety of cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| for historical overlays in cities where they're trying to preserve some open green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| and transferring the density rights of one property owner into another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| and creating districts, and this is something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| It also involves some overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| I'm going to get you some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| I'm sorry I'm a little bit late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| but I've been trying to work with some people who've been helping me do some research on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| and I'm going to have some more information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| But I think that this is something that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| I don't think necessarily since some states have this with state statute provisions for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| it also involves city councils, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| That's why I just thought we probably need to have a public meeting to thoroughly understand this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| and to do our homework on this before we implement this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I don't know if it's ever been used in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| but I know that it's subject to being used this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Now, what is, I seem to vaguely remember some situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| Is this like where you've got a, say somebody wants to build in a wetlands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| that they can actually go ahead and build there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| and then they can create a wetlands somewhere else or preserve a wetlands somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| Let's say that there's a property right here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| And surrounding this property, let's say he gets five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| and all the properties surrounding that piece of property are low density, maybe at one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Well, he wants to buy their development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| So he goes up and he can knock on these people's door and purchase for cash their rights for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| When he does that, then let's say there's one house here for one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| So you're saying that he could actually incorporate them into his subdivision so that, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=812)|
| 0:13:40| if the county commission and the MPC give someone four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| that they could then go out and get the homeowners surrounding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| so that they could actually build five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| But when you incorporate the rest of the land, it becomes four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| So the original landowner would, like, he bought a neighboring person's development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| and he could buy out their, get their property rezoned to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| But let's say they have a house per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| So they already have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| So he takes the four and adds it to his that he owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| So he's actually buying people's development rights on adjoining properties that he doesn't necessarily have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| And this has been used in other areas to actually preserve some farmland, and it's been used for the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| But there has to be overlays and there has to be deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| which when we asked specific questions last evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| it doesn't appear that there's going to be any deed restrictions for the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| So that's why I just think, I think that this type of concept is one of the top ten new concepts being used in land use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| But I do think that since it's possibly new to Knox County that we need to have some public hearings on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| so that way politicians, landowners, developers and the public understand how this is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| I think we need some input from the law department to understand what types of overlays do we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| what types of deed restrictions do we need to have in place in order to incorporate this type of land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| So basically you want to have some hearings to decide whether we want to use this type of tool in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=919)|
| 0:15:28| You're not proposing that this be used on a lot by lot basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=928)|
| 0:15:37| You're saying that we need to talk about this before we start using this tool locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| This can be used right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| It can be used right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| See, I've not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| I understand you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Well, what they're doing is, Lumpy, let me simplify this a little bit if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| I've got five acres here and I've got five, I can build five houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| That's 25 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Mr. Frazier has five more acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| She incorporates this by her development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| That gives me, she doesn't sell me her property, just her development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| I can put 25 more houses on my five acres if she sells me those rights, but she can never build anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| She can never build anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| But when I go to sell my property, there's no deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| So that's where the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Okay, but let's say we did that in this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Then when I go to sell my land, there's no deed restrictions on my property that says that I sold my development rights to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| But you sold your development rights to me when you let me incorporate it into this partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| For your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| But then let's say somebody comes to buy my land and they want to put five units per acre because my land has been zoned for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| There's no deed restrictions to say that it can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| There's no deed restrictions, but when it come up before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| they would see the development rights had already been sold on that, should be, and you can't develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| Now, that's my understanding on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| We did this a little bit in reverse, I believe, on that Kern farm up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| If you'll remember, when we bought that property, there's development rights on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| We released the development rights on it just a backward deal to where no one could ever build on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| And that's sort of the way that was tanked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| You know, nobody could ever build on it except the people that owned the property, and it had to be the immediate family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| You know, it's my understanding that when we rezone a piece of property, it's site-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| And we give someone who's got five acres, they can build up to five units, they've got 25 units at their max that they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| I don't think you can, as of right now, you can go, I could be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| but I don't think you can go around and buy up the surrounding rights and development rights from your neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| and put it all there, at least I didn't think you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Well, at this meeting last night, the gentleman's already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Well, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| If it's already done, it doesn't mean it's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Well, MPC set there and gave us an example that it was legal, Mark Donaldson, that they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| Well, I think it's a question that we need to pose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| I wish the law director was here to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| I think it's something that needs to be checked into by our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| Well, I think that's why I just thought that, and it's coming up to MPC, not this Thursday, but next Thursday at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| and then it will come before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| And I just believe that we need to have a workshop or some public hearings because the people at the meeting last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| it was a very difficult concept to wrap your brain around, and it took a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| and I don't think it sunk in with maybe half of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| I don't think they understood the complexities or the unintended consequences of such an arrangement for land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| Well, I find that very disturbing myself because if we, as a commission, have granted, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| that five units per acre and we think it's a good thing to do to put 25 units on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1130)|
| 0:18:58| that doesn't mean that we think it's a good thing to do to put 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Because sometime down the road, eventually, maybe not within the next few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| but someone's going to want to do something with that five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| and they're going to say, well, you know, why can't I develop this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| And they're going to come before some other body and maybe eventually get development rights restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| I can see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Well, the way it was explained to us last night, I don't think you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| It's really like selling your mineral rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| You know, you sell them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| You can't sell them to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| And when you buy that property, those mineral rights go with that deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| But Mark Donaldson sat there last night, and we talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| and it's already been done in South Knoxville, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| Victor Jernigan bought some rights, development rights, on property joint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| Well, I think that needs to be found out whether or not that's legal to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| Well, Mark led us to believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| And, of course, he made it clear that nothing could ever be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| no more houses could ever be built on the property that the people sold their development rights to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| That could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| But we also asked if there was deed restrictions, and he answered no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| And then somebody else said, well, even if there were deed restrictions, those could be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| So we need to understand the complexities of this and if this is going to be allowed in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| if this has been used before, before we proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| Yeah, there's a lot of potential here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I could very easily see someone selling their development rights to a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| so they could build a higher density subdivision and then put their property up for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| and then somebody buy a piece of property to put their own subdivision on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| and then, lo and behold, they can't put anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| And they call that a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| I mean, that's what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| They're trying to zone all of the adjoining contiguous properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| and get them all zoned so they all match and then calling that a certain district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| So they're taking two PR districts and combining them into one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| but really only one landowner gets the benefit of the transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| Well, that would be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| To the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| And I do have some other documents that would be coming down to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| So I just thought this was a great fact sheet from Ohio State University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| and then there's another investigation that we've done that will also be beneficial, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1286)|
| 0:21:35| It will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to add a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| I mean, I'm moralizing Emily Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| We had it on last month, but her family was out of town, and they'll be here this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| Also, I'd like to add a resolution to, since we withdrew selling of Midway Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| add that back to the agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Anything from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I have one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I'm going to put it on the message board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| We have to have two public hearings on the term limits before it goes to second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1329)|
| 0:22:19| Check your message board and give me some dates of when you think we can have two public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Seeing none, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080806-agenda-meeting?start=1350)|
