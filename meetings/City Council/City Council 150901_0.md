| 0:01:33| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Great. We have all nine Councilmembers here tonight. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| So moved. Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| Any opposed? Minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Yes. Well, Councilman, do you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Well, what I wanted to address was, in essence, a motion to move up items 12D, E, and F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| because we have a large number of people here to talk about it, but we have something to report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| Well, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Yes, so I was going to come to that, but if you want to go ahead, is there any objection from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Do I need to take a formal vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Since there's no objection, we'll add 12E and F after 8A, elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| So, okay, we're back now to being added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| Yes, I'd like to add 11M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| That is the internal auditor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Okay, we have a motion and a second to add 11M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| so that will come at that right place in the agenda on the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| That is added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| Okay, anything else to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Consent items are 11H through I for certificates of compliance, and 11J through O for pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| and 12G through L for 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Those are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| For the mayor's report, first I'd like to remind everyone that we are entering into election season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| or to early voting and then the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Early voting starts a week from tomorrow, next Wednesday, September 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| and continues through Thursday, September 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| I know everybody in this audience will be voting because you all really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| We come out to council meetings and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| The primary election is on Tuesday, September 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| and no matter who you're voting for, we all, I think, would encourage you to get out and to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| You can get information about early voting locations and hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| as well as all the details about who is on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| on the website of the Knox County Election Commission at knoxcounty.org slash election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| Also, there's the knoxvotes.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| You can still go to it that way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| A reminder that we will have our annual 9-11 memorial ceremony out here on the lawn of the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=261)|
| 0:04:29| beginning at 840 a.m. on Friday, September 11th, 840 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| In addition to remembering those lost on that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| the ceremony will also recognize our local first responders who went to New York City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| to aid with the search and the recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| Also, I want to remind everybody that this weekend, well, actually two things this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=288)|
| 0:04:57| Saturday, on Cumberland Avenue, before the football game, which is out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| but in preparation for that, we're having a brick-by-brick pregame on the strip event with the merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=302)|
| 0:05:10| The Merchants Association and the city are coming together to close between 18th and 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| The side streets will still be open, but there will be a block party from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| We have something like 35-plus vendors who will be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| We encourage you to come between 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and then at 4 p.m. to stay, go into the restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| the bars, wherever you want to be, and watch the ball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| So stay right there on the strip and watch the game on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| And so that is this Saturday, and there's plenty of parking around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| If you go to CumberlandConnections.com, that's the website that gives you all kinds of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| about the Cumberland improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| There's also an app called Cumberland Connections for your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| If you go there, you can get more information about what I just said and where the parking is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Also then, the next day will be Booms Day, and the festivities start at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| It's over after the fireworks, which start about 9.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| There will be live music, a lot of the Family Fun Zone vendors, and, of course, the highlight, the fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| This is, as you all know, the last Booms Day, and so we hope everyone will come out and help us enjoy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| Also, there's some good news from our city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| We have two events that are coming up in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| On Friday, September 11th, at 4 p.m., we'll have the grand opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| of the new Hank Rapéh Playground at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| This is the first major new feature to open at Lakeshore since we updated the Lakeshore Master Plan last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| You probably have heard the story of the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| It's named for a young boy who tragically died just days before he would have started to play tee ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| in the Knox Youth Sports Leagues at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| His parents, Matt and Brandi Rapéh, wanted to do something for the community as a memorial to their son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| so they and the Lakeshore Park Board led the fundraising effort for this playground, raising more than $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| It is a universally accessible playground, meaning that it is open and accessible to children of all abilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| and it will be a great addition to that beautiful park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| So, again, that grand opening will be at 4 p.m. on Friday, September 11th, at Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| and the playground is near the Knox Youth Sports Baseball Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Then on Monday, September 14th at 10 a.m., we will officially open the new pickleball courts at West Hills Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| and I'm looking at you, Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| He's in a pickle himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| He's in a pickle right now, so your big challenge to me apparently is not going to happen this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| No, it will. It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Oh, it will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Oh, darn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| I was hoping you'd, like, want to get out of it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Well, we'll play it day by day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Day by day, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Well, if we need to postpone it and come back for our big challenge, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| Do that, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Yeah, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Okay, so we talked about this a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Pickleball is a fast-growing and very popular game with people of all ages, including Duane's and my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| If you want to see what it's all about, come on out to the ribbon cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| and someone will be doing some demos for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| We're not quite sure who that will be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| And you can even try it yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| So that is Monday, the 14th, at 10 a.m. at West Hills Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| And finally, just a reminder that this Monday will be Labor Day and our offices will be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| That's Monday, September 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| We hope you all have a great holiday with your family and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Anybody else have a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| As far as that challenge goes, I hope that maybe I can challenge you with a handicap, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| just in case if you win I can declare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| I knew you were going to have to have an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Yeah, maybe that's why I fell, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| No, two things I'd like to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| First of all, both Marsh and I would like to thank not only council and the mayor and the mayor's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| but also a number of citizens for their thoughts, prayers, and concerns over the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| And, Mayor, this is definitely a very caring city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| and it's been exemplified by the situation that I've been in in the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| So I just want to say on behalf of both Marsh and I, we want to thank all of you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| The other thing is that, as you folks know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| we had the groundbreaking and the dedication of the Everly Brothers Park there in Bearden a week ago Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| We had a very pleasant visit this past Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| None of the Everlys were able to attend the groundbreaking celebration that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| Don was sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| He had really planned to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| But Amy Midas and Dennis Owen and Terry Faulkner got a call from Patty Everly, who is Phil's widow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=605)|
| 0:10:14| And they were going to be in the area, and they asked if they could come and visit the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| and see where it is and see what it was that we had in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| And so on Sunday afternoon, Patty arrived, along with Benicia Everly, who is Don's daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| and Don's two grandchildren, Arabella and Sterling, also arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| There were several other people that came with them, but they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| And it was a very pleasant afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| They wanted to see the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| They went to West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| The principal at West High School met us there that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| They went through the old part of the West High School to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| They wanted to see where the Everly brothers lived in Sequoia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| then also down along Sutherland Avenue, came downtown also to see where the old record shop was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| and the visited places on Cumberland Avenue and the Highlands Grill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| and spent a really nice afternoon, two or three hours, with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| I want to thank Jesse for making those arrangements and putting that all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| and so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| And I did want to say that all the Everlys, that three generations, extremely gracious people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| they are so honored that Knoxville wants to honor their father and their grandfather in such a way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| And they've said that they're going to plan to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| And, Mayor, they look forward to meeting you the next time, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| So I just wanted to report on that, that it was really an exciting afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| and they're really pleased that Knoxville wants to honor them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| And Dwayne will sing the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Are we allowed to make you laugh tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Anything else from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Councilman Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Yeah, I just want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| I'm not sure how to even frame this, but I have to say I've been appalled by the national news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| where we're learning about, I don't know what, rebel rousers or anarchists attacking our police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| I think it's just absolutely awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| And I can't imagine a city or a town without good police force work that's keeping it safe for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=728)|
| 0:12:17| and trying to get the laws to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| And I hope our citizens who may be approached by someone with this kind of mindset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| please, don't go down that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| It's just an awful, awful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| And I can't imagine what the families of policemen and policewomen think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| when dad or mom gets in the car and goes to work and there are crazies on the street who threaten their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| So, again, I hope all Knoxvillians will rally around our troops, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| and cooperate and work with the police in everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| And we certainly thank and appreciate their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| Now we'll move on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Eight days of resolution confirming the reappointment of Rosa Marr and Ann Barker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| to the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Now we're moving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| 12-D, E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| 12-D, E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| 12-D is an ordinance approving the request of Smith-Lindsay Development, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| for an amendment to the North City Sector Plan from low-density residential to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| for property located on the south side of Gibbs Drive, east side of North Broadway, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| I know there's a number of people here that represent both sides of the discussion that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| both the sector plan and the one-year plan and the rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| and I think there's sincerity on both sides of the aisle on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| I'm happy to report we had a delay when this came up in mid-August to move it to tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| but the folks have been meeting and working and having neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| and meetings with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| They're trying to find, and they think they have found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| and we're going to hear from one or two of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| I think they have found a way to resolve their differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| The goal, of course, was to come up with some kind of win-win approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| where uses could be made on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| and the neighborhood and historic Gibbs Drive be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| These, I guess they're covenants and restrictions, have been in place since 1917,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| and this street has some charming homes that have been there a lot of those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| and people are restoring them as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| The debate was would that corner lot, there's actually two of them on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| could that go commercial or office or some other use or mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| and the parties have really been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| They've been exchanging drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| They've been talking about how it might work and what they might do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| and I understand that they are at the point where they are going to come up with some new deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| or covenant and restrictions that affect that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| but allow the part closest to Gibbs Drive to have an office use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| something MPC has approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| and the other section closer to the Chick-fil-A further to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| would have some commercial use, neighborhood commercial C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| and in that situation there would be certain restrictions they would agree to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| as a matter of deed and platting and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| There's a spokesperson from each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| I think they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| There's a number of people that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| because we weren't sure whether this issue was going to be resolved as recently as noon today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| but they have reached an agreement in principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Obviously it will take some, I don't want to say paper shuffling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| paper creation by lawyers to document their understandings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| and to work out any kinks that they run to as they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| but the good news is that we're not going to have an hour-long debate tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| about whether there should be office or commercial or some hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| They are working amongst themselves, which I think we always appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| to come up with a solution that everyone can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| That's what I wanted to say as a preliminary remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| I will say in addition, speaking to Mr. Swanson and to Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| I understand that because C1 was not technically in front of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| there's probably going to be a visit to MPC to have them look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| I can say that their director, Mr. Green, has talked to both the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| very familiar with the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| but it's a base we have to touch under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| and I understand that this can be done because it's coming from counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| This can be done in a way that does not get anyone nervous about a 120-day limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| or anything, that counsel will be referring it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| But that's the preliminary remarks I wanted to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| and there are obviously folks that want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Wayne Klein, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| I do have to set my timer, don't forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| I won't take that long, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Up to five minutes, take as much time as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| I'm going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I'm here on behalf of the developer, Smith-Lindsay Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| and Mr. Marcus Chetty is here with me on behalf of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| There has been a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| There's going to be more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| We're about that close to being done, folks, and we're in principle in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| But what we need from you is a request, a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| granted to send this back to MPC for revision of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| to provide for resubdivision of the property to allow for two separate zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| And in that sense, that's what we're asking for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| I'll let Mr. Chetty tell you about the neighborhood's agreement with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| and we hope that we can come back to you again and still be in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| We're going to draft some restrictive covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| and have them executed hopefully before we get to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Marcus Chetty, 2841 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| I'm here on behalf of the historic Gibbs Drive Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| I'd first like to thank all council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| There's been a significant amount of communication between myself, my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| and many of you, and you've been quite responsive to our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| Mr. Kline indicated that we're this close, and we would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| The key on striking this compromise is that there are conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| that protect the neighborhood and meet the developer's requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| that are executed as a resolution for rezoning, which you all will eventually see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| but also that conditions be executed by deed restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| That's really the reason that we're not quite ready to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| with a resolution for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| The neighborhood and our council find it imperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| that these conditions be executed by deed restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| I think the original covenants and restrictions actually date back to 1910,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| so 105 years of protection that the neighborhood has enjoyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| to preserve the historic character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| We have a legacy and an awesome responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| not only to our own homes, our own families that will inherit our homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| our neighbors, but the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| The historic neighborhoods in this city are truly an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| You council members demonstrate that every time you fund initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| for historic preservation and neighborhood advocacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| and we're just lockstep in that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Ironing out the details of these deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| is why we need a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| We need to go back to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| We'll get signature on deed restrictions and then work with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| Mr. Smith has agreed in principle to executing these conditions by deed restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| and then everything falls in step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| and we come to you with a recommendation from the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| We're all smiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| You all get to smile and vote unanimously, and everybody's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Let's take a picture of this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| We like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Please put your pitchforks down when we take the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| We love it when compromise and solutions can be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| So is there something else you're going to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| I was going to make the motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Okay, let me just ask one thing, Councilman, for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| I have three more people that I believe are from Gibbs community that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Are they all deferring to you then on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| I have Connie Cavanaugh, Paul Dickinson, and Steve Muffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Steve and Paul are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| J.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Okay, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| At this point, and I'm hoping this is the right procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| but someone will correct me if I am wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| that I'm moving that we refer this matter to MPCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| and that's both 12D, E, and F, all three pieces of the puzzle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| so that they may consider the additional element of commercial one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| neighborhood commercial on the southernmost part of this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| and then treat the northernmost portion as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| And that wasn't considered exactly, although commercial was in the picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| and so was office, but to do this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| we're moving that it go back to MPC for their recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| and obviously their paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| and then it will be back here before Council as a formal action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| whenever MPC is done and refers it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| A second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| So we have a motion and a second to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| I won't repeat it all because I couldn't, but to refer this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| It's really a motion to refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| The rest of it is sort of surplusage and explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| Surplusage sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| So it's a motion to refer back to MPC for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1380)|

| 0:23:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| No, we actually had to go back, remember, to we're back on 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1419)|

| 0:25:20| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Yeah, if I could ask Mr. Hagerman just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| I remember at one time they were talking about maybe leaving Kingston Pike and going parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| to it to avoid a sort of a bad traffic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| Is this fixing Kingston Pike itself for this kind of multi-use biking and walking or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| it an alternate path that gets people around the congestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| The signed bike route which sort of got this whole process started could not find a parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| path in that section and in order to get through there you pretty much have to get in the lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| because there isn't even a shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| So this initially was looking at adding some shoulder but then it became really clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| there was a need for some more sidewalk and access to the bus stops there and then just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| coincidentally Whole Foods and REI redeveloped across the street so there was good reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| to get pedestrians across Kingston Pike and there was a grant opportunity to put all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| together in one package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| So this is the final evolution of where we want to go with this fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1601)|

| 0:32:01| Just wanted to ask Mr. Swanson or someone who represents the pension body, the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| that got me wondering was, and I understand we're just trying to conform to now a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| state law that allows you to follow these qualified domestic relations orders in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1933)|
| 0:32:21| of how people use their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| There was a reference in the information statement that the prohibition was in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| charter that prohibited those benefits except for child support, and I was wondering how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| by resolution and plan amendment do we sort of get by the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| I mean, state law probably trumps our charter, but I'd like to hear that just because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| raised a little question in my mind as to whether we were doing something that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| the power to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| State law trumps our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| That was really well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| Would Council have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I certainly agree with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| State your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| My name is Kathy Aslinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| I'm attorney for the City of Knoxville Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| The charter has a typical provision in a qualified retirement plan that says a participant cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1991)|
| 0:33:19| assign the benefit to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| It's what we would call an anti-assignment clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| There is an exception specifically in the charter for child support, but at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| the charter was written, then state law provided that a Tennessee governmental plan could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| comply with a qualified domestic relations order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| The charter also provides that the plan is meant to be a qualified plan, and it provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| that provisions related to the qualification of the plan can be in the supplemental plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Because there is no current provision in the charter addressing the authority to pay pursuant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| to a quadro, and because to maintain the qualified status of the plan, you have to follow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| terms of the plan in the plan document, then we believe that that provision and that authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| can be set forth in the supplemental plan provisions to both comply with state law and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| to keep the plan qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| And it obviously keeps with the spirit of the thing, which is to observe state law and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| to keep it qualified under the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| So we're acting in conformance with all those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150901?start=2067)|
