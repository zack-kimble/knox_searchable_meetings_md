| 0:02:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| This is item 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| It has to do with the ordinance regarding falsehoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=150)|

| 0:02:46| police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| The primary reason for this is there is an installation of a new information management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| service going on in the police department and we want to make sure that everything we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| do interfaces with that well and are not sure of the timetable so that rather than a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| ask for a withdrawal and we'll start fresh with this issue in several months when that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=185)|

| 0:03:40| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| Under mayor's report I have a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| First I would like to welcome our new 5th District Councilman, Charles Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=231)|
| 0:04:00| Nesaf, bydd y Cynulliad yn cael gweithdai ar gyfer trafodaethau minoriaid ar gyfer 3 Februari, 5.00 pm yma yn yr ystafell fwyaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=240)|

| 0:04:22| Hefyd, bydd yna gweithdai dros 10 mlynedd ar gyfer trafodaethau cyhoeddus ynghylch adnoddau cefnogol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=262)|

| 0:04:56| Yn ddiweddaraf, roeddwn i'n cael cyfle i fynd i ystod y gweithdai yng Nghymru ar gyfer trafodaethau cyhoeddus yng Nghymru yn Washington DC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| Roedd y Gweithdai Cynulliadol yng Nghymru yn siarad gyda ni am y cyhoeddus ar gyfer y trafodaethau cyhoeddus yno.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=304)|
| 0:05:14| Roedd y Gweithdai Cyhoeddus yn cael cerdd yr oeddwn wedi'i ysgrifennu, ac roedd hynny'n beth cyhoeddus i'w ysgrifennu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| Nid ydw i'n mynd i ddysgu'r holl hynny, ond rydw i'n mynd i ysgrifennu ychydig ffyrdd o'r cyhoeddus hwnnw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| Mae'n dweud, oherwydd bod y gweithdai'n ymddiriedolaethau cyhoeddus yng nghyfarfod y bobl, mae'n rhaid i'r cyhoeddus ddechrau gyda ni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=327)|
| 0:05:37| Byddwn i eisiau cymryd ystod i ymddygiad ar y cyhoeddus hwnnw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| Rydyn ni'n ffodus iawn yn y Cyngor hon, ac, ar hyn o bryd, yn ein byd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| byddwn i'n cael y cyfrod yr oeddwn i'n ei fynud, ac erbyn anodd oedden ni yn cyhoeddus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| rydw i wedi bod yn pyfartrefu gan y ffyrdd gyffredinol y gwneithom ni'n cymryd busnes cyhoeddus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| Mae hynny'n rhywbeth rydyn ni'n gwybod ein bod ni eisiau ei gael, a chynnwys at y rhain sy'n berthynas atyn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| Fedrwn i hefyd, fel hynny yw'r Mhrifysgol Tenesig, roedd y flwyddyn o Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| Clarksville and Hendersonville and myself were the four mayors from the state of Tennessee that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| So one other thing of interest that people may want to know about, it was the 50th anniversary of the inauguration of President Kennedy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=380)|
| 0:06:29| and there were some events going on to remember that and his daughter Caroline Kennedy did come and address that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=389)|
| 0:06:40| All right, now reports from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| I just want to remind the leadership in the second district from the neighborhoods that we are having a meeting this Saturday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| from 10 to 12 at Panera's in Bearden and the mayor will be there along with David Brace and David Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| So I just want to make sure that that gets on the record once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| And one other thing, Mayor, that I wanted to bring up is that I would like to, on behalf of the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| to extend our condolences to the Stephanie James family and to the crew of workers at the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| who have gone through quite a lot with the death of Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| I think a lot of times we take for granted the work that the keepers of these animals do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| and a lot of times we don't realize how their lives are in danger with the live wild animals that they deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| And so I think that on behalf of council we'd like to extend our condolences to the Stephanie James family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| Thank you, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Very well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| And let's also add our condolences to the gentleman who lost his life today working on the Henley Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=470)|
| 0:07:59| a native of Athens, Tennessee, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| So we want to add that family, keep them in our condolences as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| So, Ms. Mitchell, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| 8A is a resolution rescinding resolution number R1211 to the extent of the reappointments of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| Louis Crossley and Beth Waters to the Board of Directors of Community Television of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| and reappointing Jason Clabo to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=516)|

| 0:08:44| to OS1 district Metropolitan Planning Commission applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=524)|

| 0:08:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I wonder if, to the extent we have any discussion on these, I know we've talked about all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| that we would combine items 9B, C, D, and J together because it strikes me that we are dealing with the same subject matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=536)|
| 0:09:08| and I think we have to do a little sorting out of perhaps 9B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| so it might be worthwhile to include the others in the discussion to the extent we have one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| I'll move that we combine those for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| We had a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Did you second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Let's vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| Just procedurally, if we can, what he is asking to do is to combine a number of items together for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=576)|
| 0:09:46| and, frankly, just logically speaking, that motion ought to take some priority over the motion to approve 9B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=586)|
| 0:09:56| and you should decide whether you're going to consider all the items together or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| Just as a matter of making it work properly, that would be the appropriate way to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| So unless there is a significant objection to it, I would suggest to the Chair that we simply, by agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=607)|
| 0:10:16| rescind that particular motion and consider the motion of considering all of those items together as a procedural motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| rather than really a substantive motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Does Councilman Grieve need to rescind his motion to approve first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| I think we can simply do it by agreement unless someone wants to object to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| Without objection, we will simply do it by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| My question is regarding Councilman Della Volpe's motion to consider these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| I support the idea of discussing them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| I think since we're changing our code of ordinances, it feels to me like we ought to vote on each item individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| I just want to talk about them together but not vote on them as a package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| Did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| I made a motion, but it hasn't been seconded yet, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| I'm going to read them all first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| Do we need to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| Well, we would discuss these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| I think there's a little confusion on my part, but I think I know where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| One of the things that happened in this long debate was let's treat active parks different from passive parks that are open land and green space in private and public ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=701)|
| 0:11:52| And MPC has done a good job of sorting all that out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| It strikes me that 9B was the original motion we had to rezone all parks OS1, but I thought that's a path we're not going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=717)|
| 0:12:07| So I'm thinking but don't know and probably would like to hear from Mr. Donaldson if we're in favor of having a two zone world of OS1 for open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=727)|
| 0:12:19| and OS2 for active parks with 9J actually parceling out which zone you go into that 9B becomes moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=739)|
| 0:12:30| And I want to just confirm that if that's correct or not that 9B was like the starter seed that got us in this and we went around and around and around about whether we should have eight more big open space parks in OS1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=750)|
| 0:12:44| or whether we needed to kind of recalibrate and start over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| So would you address that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you, Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| If you are inclined to approve 9J, which is to rezone all of the public parks to either OS1 or OS2, 9B becomes redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=772)|
| 0:13:09| The parks that were recommended for OS1 under that original request are included as OS1 in 9J and then the list of parks is greatly expanded in J compared to the list of parks to be rezoned in B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=789)|
| 0:13:28| So if you approve 9J and I'm inclined to believe that you're going to, then you don't have to act on 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=808)|
| 0:13:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| And that was, I guess, my concern because when you start reading 9B, it talks about all the city parks going into OS1 and we're doing the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| So I don't know whether procedurally, Mr. Swanson, we should take up the other pieces of adding the regulations for OS1 and OS2 and test 9J and then come back to B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=828)|
| 0:14:00| I don't know what the smart way to do this is, but it seems kind of goofy to approve 9B and then decide we don't need it and we've got an ordinance that goes nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=840)|
| 0:14:08| Well, I think that's really up to you as to how you all want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| I would agree certainly with Mr. Donaldson that if the way you're going ultimately ends up with 9J being approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| then 9B would be perhaps not only redundant, perhaps contradictory to 9J and I don't think you would want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=862)|
| 0:14:32| So you could conclude that what you want to do is consider 9B as the last item to be considered among this group that you've decided to consider together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=872)|
| 0:14:43| That's probably what I would recommend to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Switch the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| That you simply agree to switch the order and move 9B to the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| And if you have approved 9J when you come to 9B, simply either not make a motion or move to withdraw, as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| Excellent suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I'll move that we do that reordering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Did you make a motion to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| It was a whatever he said motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| It was a short form of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Mr. Mayor, if we have a little break here in the parks discussion, I need to make an apology and ask for a personal point of privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| I was supposed to call on someone during council reports to make a presentation to council, and I neglected to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| I got caught up in our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| As a point of privilege, could I ask to go back to council reports and recognize this individual so that she doesn't need to stay for the entire meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| Well, I think you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| I don't know if we'd need a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| Is there an objection to doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Thank you, and I sincerely apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=948)|

| 0:28:46| I do have a question for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| I have spoken to him briefly just about it, but my concern is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| This is engineering services, and I'm sure MAC Tech is a fine company and has the capability of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| This is an engineering effort that could be used or the money that's involved could be used to build, train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1741)|
| 0:29:10| and get our staff ready to do other greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| We are going to be doing greenways for the next 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| and if we had that kind of money to do in-house development of staff and in-house greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| I think we would save money over the long haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| So I don't question that his staff is busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| I don't question that he's picked a very good engineer to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| My question to him is, with that kind of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| you could have your own Cracker Jack Greenway team that would go from there to the next one to the next one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| and build a level of expertise that enables you to be more efficient, cost efficient, in doing this in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1785)|
| 0:29:55| and I'm sure there are great answers to the contrary, but that's the observation I wanted to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| and ask you to address that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| The CEI process, Construction Engineering Inspection process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| that we are required to fulfill with a project that's funded through the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| is a very detailed process that we don't have enough staff to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| If this was a greenway that was funded by 100% city dollars, we would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| We have the expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| What we don't have is the personnel to keep all the records and the files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| It's really an unbelievable process that we're required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| and this is all a part of the local programs guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| You're going to see contracts like this on every project that we have that's funded through TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1844)|
| 0:30:52| or the FHWA or the STP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Federal money brings bureaucracy or bureaucratic requirements with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| And so these people are more expert at documenting this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| They're more expert at documenting all the phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| There's a variety of, like, for example, for concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| you have to have an inspector test the aggregate, test the cement, test the concrete mixture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| All the compressive strength and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Well, even before that, you have to test the aggregate itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| to make sure it has the proper hardness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| There's a myriad of tests that we don't have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| and the manpower to do without contracting it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| And we typically, on a project where we fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| we would not do that level of material type testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| We inspect the we think our we know where our aggregates come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| We know who produces the concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| We test the compressive strength of the concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| You think you could hold up a bicycle and a person walking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| So this is because of the federal nature of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Is there any staff involvement you can assure you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| so that to the extent there's a learning curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| you pick up on that and get someone trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| We will assign staff to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| We won't just turn a consultant loose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| because we want to know how our project goes together for future maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I was just concerned that we were losing an opportunity to build in-house expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| because this is going to be it's not a one-year or two-year project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| These projects are going to go on into the future as we do a few miles each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| So I was concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| We may need to restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| It's to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| It's already moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| with Wilbur Smith Associates, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| for an advanced traffic management system study in an amount not to exceed $186,120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1983)|

| 0:33:06| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1986)|

| 0:33:08| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| with the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| for a 10-foot-wide greenway along First Creek beginning near Fulton High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| and terminating at Edgewood Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| with the city to pay an amount not to exceed 20% of the total estimated cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| or $151,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Mr. Delavalle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Yeah, I was just going to ask Steve King or Mr. Walsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| I didn't see in here the number of either feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| running feet or percentage of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| but you can calculate that by looking at where Edgewood Park is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| This is part of a bigger chunk, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| We're doing this piece looking to work First Creek up to a further destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| I wonder if someone would just fill us in on this piece of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| Joe Walsh is coming, but I think he can probably give you more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| Engineering is assisting recreation in the administration of the grant that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| and Joe and his staff have done a lot of work in master planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| where they want to build greenways, and he can give you a little more detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Joe, sing to us, because I know a lot of citizens are concerned about getting greenways in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| I mean, Fountain City Connections obviously works hard at planning the area up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| If you would just tell us a little bit about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| and the overall scope if we ever do more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Certainly, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| As you're aware, having been on Council for a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| we are committed to building greenways throughout Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| but it is a slow, expensive process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| and we're fortunate to get funding for this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| to build this one section of First Creek Greenway from Fulton High School to Edgewood Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| Ultimately, our goal is to have First Creek Greenway go all the way from the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| all the way out to Fountain City Park, which is several miles of greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And to do that, we're going to do it in small bits and pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| So this was an application we submitted to TDOT back in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| We were very pleased to get such a quick turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Normally, the authorization and the approval of a contract from TDOT takes up to a year or longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| but we had this turnaround in about 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| so we're excited about the opportunity of working with Mr. King and the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| to lay this one section of greenway out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| It will be about a little less than a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| A little less than a mile, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| And I notice that you don't start construction until 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| Is there a reason why there's that much kind of advance effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| Is that another one of those the paperwork is a heavy burden to carry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| We're very fortunate over the years to have our own engineering department working with us closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| to do a lot of this legwork that has to be done in order to get us to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| where we're actually ready to let a bid into construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| One other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Is that channelization work that's being done up by Emmerlin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| will that ultimately be tied into the creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Will that be tied into the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| We would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| We had that in the back of our mind as we were working with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and the public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| As this work takes place through that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| we would see there's an opportunity to make that future connection from Edgewood Park going north up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| toward Whittle Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Mr. Walsh, before you leave, if you would, we all know you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| but for the record, if you would give us your name and who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| I'm Joe Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| I'm the City of Knoxville Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| People watching on television may not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2211)|

| 0:37:31| to provide training software and services for the Knoxville Police and Fire Departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| for an amount not to exceed a total cost of $39,950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2255)|

| 0:37:42| Mr. DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| I just wanted to ask one of the two chiefs up there about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| It talks about compliance management software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| and after scratching around today, I found out that this is some of the stuff we do for our certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| as well as the fire certifications, and it was a way to track this through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| I just wanted to say that it sounded wonderful, but I didn't get that from the information packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| so someone needs to beat on these a little harder the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| But I did speak to, I guess it was Ms. Wright, and she explained it, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| Chief, maybe Chief Owen, you can tell us about how this helps you become a CALEA certified entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| or the fire department, how they have their equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| One of the things this lets us do is we have lots of continuing education that's required for state licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| and certifications, and this is going to allow us to be able to track that automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| It will send updates to people saying, you know, it's time to renew your certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| You have this many credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| You need to step it up, and you have to get so many within the next however many months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| and it's also going to allow us to do a lot of training in the fire hall that we're actually having to do at the training center now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2340)|
| 0:39:11| And that way people don't have to just bother at the fire hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| It's going to save us a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| So instead of little slips of paper around, we've got a computer that's getting men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| and reminding them they haven't done their job, get your credits, get the report in, get it done, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Well, we appreciate all the training you guys do, and that's why you're such good professional safety forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| and security forces on both ends there, and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2376)|

| 0:41:13| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| I was going to ask the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I couldn't quite tell, but it almost sounds like if this were in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| they'd be talking about that safety center where they're going to take folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| and instead of putting them in the drunk tank or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| they're going to take them someplace to get treatment and help through McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| or one of those other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Is this a way of kind of addressing a problem that incarceration doesn't really solve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| that we're trying to get to the root causes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Well, that's exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| As a matter of fact, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| the federal courts have been looking at the jail population for several years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| and one of the ways to address alternatives to putting people in jail if they are drunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| would be to have alternate processes, and I say drunk, and or having some sort of a mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| So we're attempting to fix the problem by getting them into counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| This is federal money that is allowing us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2536)|

| 0:43:02| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| I apologize for having questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I was just curious, and I don't know whether Mr. Lyons or Mr. King or someone knows this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| is KUB helping to pay for some of that electrical relocation or undergrounding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| I see Bob Wetzel coming here, so he's going to give us the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| I know that Downtown North is a great project, and I'm all in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| So the answer to your question is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Tell us who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| KUB is helping us pay for the underground electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| They're also working throughout this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| You'll see the big contract really in two weeks replacing the water lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| and some of the sewer lines at this time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| So you're going to get some of the visual overhead clutter out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| and do your streetscaping and get Old North, Knox, or at least Downtown North rocking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| in terms of a business opportunity and a pleasant place for pedestrian traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2630)|

| 0:44:26| I would just like to compliment the administration for making this a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| This was a project that we heard about last year during the budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| and it makes one of our city garages at the Civic Auditorium and Coliseum accessible to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| That elevator is very important to many of our patrons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| and as we are able, we are improving our facilities and making them accessible to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| and this is an important project, so I'm glad we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2689)|

| 0:45:05| ADA compliance is important, and access to a public facility like that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| This elevator also ties in that walkway to the Marriott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| so it may help us in the future with getting groups to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| and if they're going to stay at the Marriott, give their business there and get access to this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| It's a good feature, and anyone who's been to those old garages knows that while there are escalators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| they haven't run, in my memory, for at least 25 years, so they've been sitting there kind of idle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| So the elevator is needed, and I appreciate the administration for working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| I believe we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| 12A is an emergency ordinance appropriating the sum of $200 from the Community Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| and donating the same to Legacy Parks Foundation, acting as fiscal agent on behalf of Knoxville Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| and this spring's dogwood season beautification project requested by Councilmember Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| I'll move for Mr. Pavlis since he wasn't able to make the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Next we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| We have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| Mr. Robert Booker, if you will come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2787)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you, Mayor Brown and members of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| I'm Bob Booker, 2621 Parkview Avenue, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| I come to make a brief statement on the historic occasion of a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| Just as with the last presidential election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| I never thought I would see the day when a black person would serve as mayor of this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| even on an interim basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| There have been black candidates for mayor of this city for 139 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| and none has come close to winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Most of those we have known personally because they ran during the past 44 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| They include Father Matthew Jones, 1967, yours truly in 1971,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| Councilman Casey Jones in 1970 and 87, and Councilman Danny Mayfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2849)|
| 0:47:37| But it was at mayor's race in 1872 when Dr. J.B. Young became a candidate for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| He had seen the first two blacks elected to City Council three years earlier in 1869.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| He had been nominated by a group of blacks in Mount Zion Baptist Church, January 2, 1872.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| That group of men also nominated City Council candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| and ironically, one of them was named Daniel Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| And, Councilman Brown, you've held up well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| He's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Since 1869, 19 black men have been elected to the Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| None served between 1912 and 1969.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| A change to the at-large voting system would not allow blacks to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| until that system was changed 42 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| On occasion, I have been asked to give my opinion as to who would be the first black mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| Councilman Ruddy, you've heard that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| And my answer was, he or she ain't born yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| I hope that the vote of City Council on January 10, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| will help to erase my attitude on that subject entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| and I hope that it will help to erase that view in general elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2951)|
| 0:49:21| I cannot praise you City Council members enough for your courage and fair consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| You put a lot of thought and deliberation into your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| It goes a long way in setting the tone for how our city should operate in all facets of society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2972)|
| 0:49:41| Those of us who have fought for civil rights and racial matters most of our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| would just love to retire and be sure that fair play for all is the norm in this all-American city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2986)|
| 0:49:56| It is the city of my birth and the city I love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| And may we continue to progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Thank you, Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| And thank you for your years of public service as a councilman, as a state legislator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| as a special assistant to the mayor, and as a columnist for the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| The chair will now entertain a motion to adjourn, having no further business before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| And moved and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110125?start=3033)|
