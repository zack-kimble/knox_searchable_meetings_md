| 2:22:45| If you'd make a note, let's send out a letter to the fee offices asking for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| So we'll get that out promptly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8571)|
| 2:22:52| I think it shouldn't just be the fee offices, but also the courts, anyone who's employed by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8579)|

| 2:23:18| On page 5, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| authorizing an expenditure of $20,000 from the public improvement fund for renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| to the proposed lease office space on the first floor of the Midway Rehabilitation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8604)|
| 2:23:29| which the Knox County Drug Court desires to relocate its operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| This is Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| A question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| Has they come back with any contract or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| Is there a motion to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| I take a motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| So the motion is to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| Under other business, discussion regarding the Pam Rees report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8639)|
| 2:24:04| That was tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| Mr. Chairman, while we're shuffling paper, as I've said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| I've attended several school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| And I'd like for us to pause just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| Ms. Gloria Dethrich is over near the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8659)|
| 2:24:22| Please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8662)|
| 2:24:25| I'd like to recognize her as a member of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| Well, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| She's a glutton for punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8673)|
| 2:24:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| On page six, discussion regarding Knox County's false alarm policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8681)|
| 2:24:45| Mr. Shouse, did you want to discuss this further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| I'll discuss it briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| I've had several discussions, some with Mr. Jarrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| and mainly with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| And we had a constituent up in Dr. Briggs' area also that said an alarm went off for 40 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8694)|
| 2:25:02| and the police came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| Have you heard it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| Did you hear it, Jeff, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| No, I hadn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| I mean, I heard about it, but I didn't know where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| I mean, I think I read it in the paper maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| That could happen, but obviously it shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| It would drive everybody crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| But there are things, there are limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| You can have three a year without getting fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| The Knox County Sheriff's Office or his designee is required to know how to cut the alarm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| They should receive information about someone responsible for cutting a burglar alarm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| I think this instance, it was probably a home-rigged device that just was tied into the KUB system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8740)|
| 2:25:47| so it just went continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| There wasn't an ADT to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| And there's, of course, provisions for something that is a false alarm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8752)|
| 2:25:58| but not holding the individual responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| Act of God, that being lightning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| Or, of course, if somebody breaks in the house and it goes off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| But I'm confident or feel good about what the Sheriff's Office does in these situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| and I just wanted to put it on the agenda to focus a little attention on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| Discussion regarding the Knox County Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| We took care of that during the Beer Board meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| Those are all of the discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| We have a couple of items that will come up during zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| Is there any other business to come before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| Since we have a moment, the thing about the East Sector Plan being included in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8794)|
| 2:26:42| maybe does not preclude us from sitting as full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| to have a discussion about a proposal that's being advanced by Ms. Gloria Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| Could we take a moment to see if she would want to give us a sentence or two about her proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8812)|
| 2:26:58| or is that out of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Well, we were going to bring this up at our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| The zoning issue to me is about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| Yes, I mean, if it's all right with commission, we'll be happy to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| You know, we could consider this part of the citizen forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| I'm talking about so we stay according to our protocols and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| So why don't we just consider this citizen's forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| She gets five minutes and then questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| If we could, let me begin with Dean Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| Dean, would you come to the podium, please, just so commissioners know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| I've had some conversation with Mayor Burchett and Mr. Rice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| and we thought the first step would be to have the luncheon today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| to have Mr. Donaldson come and speak with you about what our obligations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| and Mr. Jarrett about where we need to move from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| And I think they very correctly said that we could do nothing and let things stand as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8865)|
| 2:27:50| or we could move ahead and look at some possible options for improvements to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8870)|
| 2:27:56| And so in our discussions, we had thought, well, if it would be commission's desire to do nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8876)|
| 2:28:03| we, of course, could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| But if there was a desire to move ahead, what would be the best procedure to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| or what would be a procedure to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| And so the mayor has advanced the notion of asking commission to allow him to appoint an ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8890)|
| 2:28:16| to take a look at possible improvements to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8896)|
| 2:28:23| possible uses of the Midway property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| And this would be an ad hoc committee that would include residents who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| It would include the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| It would include outside business interests that have no direct tie to this property whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8913)|
| 2:28:38| that could bring us a recommendation or recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| And so that was where we are, and Ms. Ray was involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| But, Mr. Rice, if you would begin with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| and then, Gloria, if you'd like to come down and speak as well, I'm sure they'll have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| And on behalf of the mayor, that is in a nutshell what the discussion has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8932)|
| 2:28:57| is to put together an ad hoc group of individuals across the spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| those who were in favor of the previous zoning and those who were in favor of changing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| and to have a well-balanced committee that everyone has buy-in on to just simply look at potential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| not looking at zoning, not stepping into the area of which you've been tasked to do as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| but to simply look at potential uses for that property that would be satisfactory to all the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8956)|
| 2:29:25| And to bring that back to commission and simply say these are some potential opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8965)|
| 2:29:30| that may exist based on this citizens committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| and then you do with them as you wish in terms of looking at what zoning overlays would need to be put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| But it would not be in any way the mayor saying this is what commission should do, A, B, or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8979)|
| 2:29:45| It's simply saying here's a group of citizens that would like to have some input in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| Gloria has very graciously agreed to assist in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| and I don't think there's anybody, very few in the county or much less in the state probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| who are better at bringing various parties together at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| and talking through in a very positive, constructive manner than Gloria is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| Gloria, would you like to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9007)|
| 2:30:18| Gloria Ray, 4833 River Place Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| After those nice comments, I feel like I just should go back and sit down and say thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| I am very pleased to have met with Chairman Hammond and also Mayor Burchett and Dean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9026)|
| 2:30:34| and have told him of my interest in doing whatever I could to help Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| by bringing some folks together and would love to have your all's endorsement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9040)|
| 2:30:46| These are people that I think will be committed to the process of talking alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9046)|
| 2:30:51| committed to the process of doing what will be best for Knox County now and in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| recognizing what's there now and what has been there and how they all fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| And I guess in the perfect world that we could live in perfect harmony between the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| and the business interest as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| So I'm being Pollyanna right now, but I really believe that we could do something good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9071)|
| 2:31:17| Can you tell us some of the people that you've contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| some of the people that might be possibles for this ad hoc committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| Again, it's an ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| It's just for recommendation purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| Well, we have from the community that have confirmed three individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| and also three from the Development Corp and the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| And from the community, I feel comfortable naming those would be Elaine Clark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9096)|
| 2:31:43| Vicki Baumgardner, and Pete Claussen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| From the Chamber Development Corp would be Mike Edwards, Rhonda Rice, and Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| From the at-large group, shall we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| you're going to see representation from the folks that you all have talked about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| the many assets that we have here from an educational standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| But we also have an advantage to have them involved in economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| from OR&L, from TVA, to the University of Tennessee, to some large manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9128)|
| 2:32:14| And I'm reluctant to name them by name because I have not talked to all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| or have not gotten a response back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| Would they be interested if you all decide to move forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| Because it's really in your court right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| But I can rest assured to you to say that it's going to be about eight individuals that are committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9147)|
| 2:32:34| They have no agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| They have nothing but really the good of Knox County of wanting to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9155)|
| 2:32:40| Questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9160)|
| 2:32:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| So just a general question about your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| Are you all going to have open meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9170)|
| 2:32:51| And we probably are only going to meet two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| I mean, this is going to be more of something that I met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| I had my sector plan 101 with Mr. Donaldson as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| And I got into section 101 and 1A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| I learned a lot more probably than I had planned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| But I think when we get in that process and we see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9188)|
| 2:33:12| what we're wanting to do is give some alternatives and options for you all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| So we won't have the long meetings that you all certainly have had to have to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9196)|
| 2:33:23| but we'll be more of a visioning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| Because in the last meeting when you all talked about it, I heard many of you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9205)|
| 2:33:29| well, what's the vision for that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| What do you see for next year and 10 years from now and 20 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| So we're going to have some folks that are going to talk in those rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| And I will tell you sustainability is a key issue that keeps coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9223)|
| 2:33:44| So there will be sunshine and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9226)|
| 2:33:47| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9227)|
| 2:33:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| Thank you, Ms. Gloyer, for stepping up to the plate again, as you always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9229)|
| 2:33:56| I think this is a great idea and I think it's just a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| It's almost like a mediation board at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| And I think that's what's needed right now to give us some direction going forward in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9242)|
| 2:34:09| And if it takes a motion to direct this, to support this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9249)|
| 2:34:14| and I think since it's an ad hoc committee, we can't tell them to do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| but we could offer a motion of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9258)|
| 2:34:23| I think that's what the mayor is looking for is just a motion of support so he can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| I'll also move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| Do we need to suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| No, this is just an express will of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| So is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9276)|
| 2:34:37| We're unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9277)|
| 2:34:38| Ms. Gloyer, you go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9279)|
| 2:34:40| We'll do our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| Mr. Rice, would you express to the mayor our appreciation for his stepping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| and willing to appoint this committee and for his work, and we look forward to seeing the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9284)|
| 2:34:48| Again, these are recommendations, but having citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| and having people talking together is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| Is there any other business to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| I didn't know whether we wanted to go ahead and talk about times now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| and discuss that for the hillside thing, or you want to wait until 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| I mean, it makes no difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| You mean set up a workshop calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9312)|
| 2:35:13| We had talked about a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9313)|
| 2:35:14| We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| I'll just throw out an idea, and that was when we have our work session in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| either meeting before or after so we're all here and just having it with a normal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9318)|
| 2:35:24| So if we wanted to meet at noon, we could do a lunch deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| or if we wanted to do it afterwards and meet at 4, say around 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9327)|
| 2:35:31| then we could do it afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| I was just thinking in terms of combining those two since we're already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| That's just an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| Can I voice the after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| Do after, so 4 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| That's what my opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| You know, it's good because we would have zonings at 6, and that would force us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9346)|
| 2:35:52| This would be for our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| That's what I mean, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| But what I mean, though, is that that would force us to stop at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| We'd have a two-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| But you're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| We're talking about a workshop, not a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| We're not talking about the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| We're talking the week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| Oh, the week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| The week before we have our workshop session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| So we do it right after the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| Because we might vote on it the next week, so this would give us a chance if, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| we do decide to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| Commissioner Norman, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Yeah, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| I also wanted to add that most of you all picked up the hard copy of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9385)|
| 2:36:31| It was in your box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| There were a few of them that were still up there, so you've got a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| And there'll probably be, and I think there's already been, a bit of an onslaught of emails of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| that are fairly inflammatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| We've been doing this a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| None of those issues are new, and we've taken them all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| And so we'll get into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| I think they'll be just as with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9414)|
| 2:36:58| I think we started out with about nine of them fairly questioning, and in the end it was a 12-2 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9418)|
| 2:37:06| So don't be alarmed by the things that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9426)|
| 2:37:09| I think those are fairly special interest driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| And I think also we'll have something in writing that probably addresses those in a pointed way within a day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9433)|
| 2:37:22| And we'll stick those in your box and have those in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| So, Jolie, if you would make note that after our work session in February at 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| or following our work session we will have the forum on hillside and slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9450)|
| 2:37:37| Commissioner Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9459)|
| 2:37:40| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9460)|
| 2:37:41| Who all is planning to go to the NACo legislative conference in March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9461)|
| 2:37:46| Do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| Is this in Washington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9469)|
| 2:37:50| Who all is planning to attend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9470)|
| 2:37:51| I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| Just the three of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9472)|

| 2:43:54| Mr. Donaldson, this is the third showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| What's the normal course of action there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| I would recommend that you deny the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| We have made repeated attempts to get them to come to the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9845)|
| 2:44:10| and they have not shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| We'll move it to the end in case they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| What I wanted to do was to we have, I believe, the same thing on the next one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| And I was going to have the discussion that you just had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| I amend my motion to denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| It is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9872)|

| 2:44:50| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| And this is in the same status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| It's been here for a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9895)|
| 2:44:56| Move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9896)|
| 2:44:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9899)|

| 2:45:24| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9925)|
| 2:45:26| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9927)|
| 2:45:28| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9929)|
| 2:45:30| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| The amendment that we had with pool permits that the law department said we can't give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9933)|
| 2:45:41| This will partially address that because it deals with accessory structures in those big side yards that were required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9941)|
| 2:45:49| But there's another amendment in the process that you referred back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| It will be coming forward to you soon that also addresses swimming pools in planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9954)|
| 2:46:01| When can we get that fast-tracked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| Because it's getting to be permit season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| It's been through the Planning Commission, so it will be out in your next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9971)|
| 2:46:16| So we have a motion and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| It has passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| That's all the business that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| And now let's move to Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9985)|
| 2:46:26| You had asked that we talk about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| And so you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| As we have had school of instruction today on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9992)|
| 2:46:37| and how sector plans find their way between MPC and commission from the planning body to the legislative body back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=9997)|
| 2:46:48| I believe one of the things that was recommended on the east county sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10008)|
| 2:46:56| since we've had three years of input and we only have 1% of the property in dispute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10016)|
| 2:47:04| and since the plan as presented was denied, that we, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10024)|
| 2:47:16| send forward a plan to be reviewed by MPC and ultimately return to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10036)|
| 2:47:25| I would submit that the plan that we need to send to MPC mirror their plan with the exception of the piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10045)|
| 2:47:35| referred to as the development core midway road business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10055)|
| 2:47:42| And this is just a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10062)|
| 2:47:47| But if we pursue that, then I'd like to see the law director prepare something for next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10067)|
| 2:47:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| I guess my only apprehension about doing that at this time is that we just kind of gave our blessings to an entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10083)|
| 2:48:12| that's going to, you know, take another look at that and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10092)|
| 2:48:17| coming from all different sides, government, private, plus the development folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| and come up with some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| I'd just like to kind of hear what they have to say before we go and strike it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| and then have to do something else with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| Like Mr. Donaldson said, we can let it sit for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| but I would hate to pass something that we have to go back and make another sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10115)|
| 2:48:42| without getting all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10126)|
| 2:48:50| Yes, when we were talking earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10130)|
| 2:48:56| I was under the impression that word had been circulating about this ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10136)|
| 2:49:02| and apparently there are some people who have been very, very involved in this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10142)|
| 2:49:09| and feel like this has sort of come up out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10149)|
| 2:49:14| And so I would actually, even though we have essentially given our blessing to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| or to the mayor to form this committee, I would, and I'll give Gloria Ray a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10160)|
| 2:49:26| would like to know who is doing the selecting to be on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10166)|
| 2:49:32| and would like to make sure that the community feels like it's being adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10172)|
| 2:49:40| or getting enough representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| And I think there were maybe a couple people here who wanted to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10184)|
| 2:49:51| Sure, let me say that the mayor will be appointing the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10191)|
| 2:49:55| and so anyone who would want to serve on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| I'm certain that Mayor Burchett would be happy to talk with them and discuss this with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10197)|
| 2:50:02| But this will be the mayor's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10202)|
| 2:50:03| It will be his selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| We'll get you just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10207)|
| 2:50:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| I agree with Sam that maybe what we ought to do is wait and see what comes out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10210)|
| 2:50:16| And I'll be honest, I really am waiting to look at this with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10216)|
| 2:50:22| And, for instance, if we approve the sector plan, you know, per the present MPC recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10222)|
| 2:50:30| and just leave that one percent out, which is the property that's owned by the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10230)|
| 2:50:36| we may be hobbling a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| And let me explain what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| I believe that much of that intersection is already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10241)|
| 2:50:47| And that was part of it, you know, that commercial part would go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10247)|
| 2:50:50| and then they would be able to develop a business part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| But if, let's say somebody comes up with a really good idea for something that may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10253)|
| 2:50:58| I don't know what zoning classification, this would be some sort of recreational zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10258)|
| 2:51:03| or some sort of zoning that would be agro-tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| I'm just trying to think of something that we may not want to leave that zone commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| right there at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| One of the things that I agreed with many of the people out there on is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10274)|
| 2:51:20| I don't like the way that a lot of our interstate intersections look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| just with Kentucky Fried Chickens and Motel 6s and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| But if somebody came up with a good idea, I don't want to go ahead and have that zoning in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10287)|
| 2:51:32| at the intersection when we may have something that's a better idea that's going to come out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10292)|
| 2:51:38| And so I really agree with Commissioner McKenzie is that what let's do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10298)|
| 2:51:43| let's see what ideas people have and then maybe do sort of a regional sector plan around, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10303)|
| 2:51:52| what may come out of it if there's really a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| rather than saying we're going to keep commercial zoning there, we're going to keep, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10314)|
| 2:51:58| keep everything else and not just look at this midway piece of property in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10318)|
| 2:52:04| I think if somebody does come up with a good idea, we may want to have a different zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10324)|
| 2:52:08| even in the areas surrounding that property, particularly along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10328)|
| 2:52:12| And that's the only comment I would make about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| We'll continue with Commissioner's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| But if you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| I'm Robert Wolfenbarger, 8416 Kodak Road, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10339)|
| 2:52:25| As many of you know me already, I'm the primary spokesperson for the people that are involved in this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10345)|
| 2:52:33| and have been for the past ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| As you know, I was here earlier this afternoon in your workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| and sat here for probably 20 minutes or so into the initiation of the county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| and weren't at that point not aware of anything to do with any ad hoc committee that was going to be formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10369)|
| 2:52:56| That's discouraging in its own right and it should be to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10376)|
| 2:53:01| Since I've communicated with all of you and you probably are aware of my relationship with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10381)|
| 2:53:08| With regard to that, we in the community were confident that the county commission would follow through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10388)|
| 2:53:17| on what we perceived to be the spirit of the denial of the East County Sector Plan last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10397)|
| 2:53:24| and follow through with an approval of the Sector Plan, as we've discussed already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10404)|
| 2:53:31| the proposed Sector Plan for 2011 or 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| and incorporate the existing zonings that are in the 2000 Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10415)|
| 2:53:42| And as we all know, the owners of the other property that we're talking about retaining the current zoning on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10422)|
| 2:53:51| which is a combination of planned residential, agricultural, and some office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10431)|
| 2:53:58| the current owners of that property, which happens to be the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| could come back and ask for a rezoning in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10441)|
| 2:54:05| Now, what I'm hearing now sounds like some kind of redo of the sector planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10445)|
| 2:54:11| as opposed to following through on the sentiment that the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| and as a matter of fact, Mike Brown suggested this afternoon we were comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10455)|
| 2:54:23| and in full agreement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| As far as this ad hoc committee, we're not necessarily opposed to ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10465)|
| 2:54:29| but I think that we should have known about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10469)|
| 2:54:37| It just sounds like, you know, something that we've experienced before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10477)|
| 2:54:44| And I'm expressing that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| I'm hoping that you're hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| Commissioner Brown's suggestion this afternoon was the direction that we thought we were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| If we're going to address this property again in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| it can be addressed through the rezoning process after the sector plan is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10498)|
| 2:55:04| And as far as an ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10504)|
| 2:55:07| I'd feel privileged to continue to participate on an ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10507)|
| 2:55:12| and address the potential use of this property in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| but that can be addressed in a rezoning process, which you all do every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10517)|
| 2:55:21| There's no need to hold up this sector plan adoption, or in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10521)|
| 2:55:29| referral back to MPC so it can ultimately come back to the commission for adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| to wait and see because that's a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| That's not an adoption or it's not in the sentiment of where we were traveling last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10537)|
| 2:55:45| And if I'm missing something, please ask me a question and I'll try to address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| or at least rethink my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| But I don't know that there's any kind of commissioner sitting here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10550)|
| 2:55:54| that knew this was the direction we were going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10554)|
| 2:56:01| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| First of all, I want to, in regards to Commissioner Wrights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10564)|
| 2:56:09| and Commissioner McKenzie, Commissioner Briggs, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| I think we should wait before we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| and there's a bigger reason that we should wait is after the ad hoc committee comes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| To me, if we do what Mr. Wolfenbarger said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| we just implemented the minus the Midway Road area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10583)|
| 2:56:28| we would have to go before MPC with a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| which gets into more legal stuff that we don't want to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10591)|
| 2:56:35| And if we can, you know, to recommend a sector amended change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| we've got to show a change and we've got to meet some of the criteria that we discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| And I think it's easier for us to breathe a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10602)|
| 2:56:47| and to see if there's another use for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| Because there's another part of the sector plan that I don't know that we've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| the Seven Islands, and I'm terrible with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| the Seven Islands where they're wanting to put this land in conservatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| I want to make sure that all the owners of that property are on board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| Because they're talking hundreds of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| And if all the property owners aren't on board with that, I can't vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| And so I think we need to re-look at the whole sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10634)|
| 2:57:19| It wasn't just the Midway Road for me, it was the, am I saying it right, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| Am I saying it correctly, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| Putting the land, Elaine, or could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| The corridor, the preservation of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| And I'm not against that, but I want all the property owners to be notified and sign off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| And so I want to make sure that those things are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| It's not just the Midway Road project for me, it's talking about the corridor also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10659)|
| 2:57:44| So I think we need to revisit the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| And, you know, it was plain in our vote last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10667)|
| 2:57:51| MPC Mark, or Mr. Donaldson, he plainly said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10671)|
| 2:57:55| if we vote it down, then we have to come back to them with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10675)|
| 2:58:01| Now, that plan could be just everything minus the Midway Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| but that wasn't the only issue that I had with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| So I think we need to heed the advice of Commissioner McKenzie and Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10688)|
| 2:58:14| and just kind of wait and see how the ad hoc committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| I have confidence that Gloria Ray can put together the right people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| and we may find something that's much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10708)|
| 2:58:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| So many points have been brought up just in 15 or 20 seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10712)|
| 2:58:38| that have been thoroughly and in depth discussed for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10718)|
| 2:58:47| A couple of months ago, whenever we voted on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10727)|
| 2:58:52| the only thing that we had any disagreement over was the one percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10732)|
| 2:58:59| just one particular field of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10739)|
| 2:59:06| There are lots of other things that are in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| like the thousand-foot overlay of commercial on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10748)|
| 2:59:14| which is a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| or moving certain query sites, which may be agricultural right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10757)|
| 2:59:23| into industrial is related to the Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10763)|
| 2:59:28| People in Carter seem to look at an overlay of a town center in Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10768)|
| 2:59:34| as something that, you know, they had to work their way through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10774)|
| 2:59:37| but they've done that over the last, and there again, I have to say, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10777)|
| 2:59:43| Mixed use just across the river bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| north of the intersection of Asheville Highway and John Sphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10787)|
| 2:59:53| two or three hundred acres that could have a new and different kind of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10793)|
| 2:59:59| mixed use I think it's referred to, residential and commercial in the same area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10799)|
| 3:00:05| something that we don't really look at most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10805)|
| 3:00:13| It's difficult for me to say do this, don't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10813)|
| 3:00:17| but the idea that, as the people standing in the podium are presenting to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10817)|
| 3:00:25| that we haven't studied it long and hard enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10825)|
| 3:00:28| and we need to maybe move on down the road just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10828)|
| 3:00:34| and accept the sector plan as we've been working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10834)|
| 3:00:37| and if there is, it doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| If we don't act, we're going to act in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| If we act now, we can still act in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| I believe that the ad hoc committee, we're already seeing questions raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10846)|
| 3:00:52| about who's going to be on it and how long is it going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10852)|
| 3:00:56| and what can be done with it, with the ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| What I am going to press for, we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| That was the position that commission by majority took a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| It's the position that I still maintain right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10871)|
| 3:01:14| and it's also the position that we got out of land use 101 at lunchtime today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10874)|
| 3:01:23| We need to take action, and at the end of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10883)|
| 3:01:29| what I'm asking is for the law director to present, prepare a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10889)|
| 3:01:34| that does 99% of what the last three-year study has brought together into a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10894)|
| 3:01:41| and we leave this particular one piece of property like it is in the past plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10901)|
| 3:01:50| I believe that's sort of the advice we got from MPC today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10910)|
| 3:01:54| We've studied it about that long, haven't we, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| It has been that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10917)|
| 3:02:00| We would like to see the 99% approved at some point in the very near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10920)|
| 3:02:05| and whether that's next month or two months down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| or four or five months down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| We just don't want to get lost and have East County Sector Plan move to the back of the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10930)|
| 3:02:15| and wait until the 11 other sectors have received an update before we get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10935)|
| 3:02:21| So I appreciate Metropolitan Planning Commission's taking a position in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10941)|
| 3:02:29| As the discussion has evolved and developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10949)|
| 3:02:33| the thing that I thought we had out of the way last couple of months ago with a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10953)|
| 3:02:41| needs to be made operational so that the validity of that data on Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10961)|
| 3:02:49| or John Sevier or Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10969)|
| 3:02:52| all of that data be incorporated into the plan made operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10972)|
| 3:02:56| The citizens of the 8th District or in that particular sector of the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| can then begin to make plans for their future based on how the lay of the land is going to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10982)|
| 3:03:09| We're just leaving out for discussion the development corporation's piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10989)|
| 3:03:16| at the Midway Road interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10996)|
| 3:03:18| And I'd like for us to take a moment and look back to recent activity that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=10998)|
| 3:03:26| sitting as the zoning commission or the zoning board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| Fox Road Marina or Fox Road Restaurant, we took it, we discussed it, we voted on it, and it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11009)|
| 3:03:39| What are our concerns for that property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| I don't know that we have any particular concern for that property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| At the end of Roberts Road on Rutledge Pike, we had a few months ago a request by the dollar store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11030)|
| 3:03:56| for some rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| I don't think it went exactly as I'd like to have seen it go, but we took action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11038)|
| 3:04:04| We voted, and today we don't really care about what the dollar store thinks about what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11044)|
| 3:04:10| Now, maybe they'll come back, maybe they'll go to court, maybe they're happy with what they received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11050)|
| 3:04:15| But to think that we're today discussing something on behalf of that property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11055)|
| 3:04:21| I don't think we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| And I think the same thing is true of the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11063)|
| 3:04:27| They're a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11067)|
| 3:04:28| We've taken a position, we've voted, and we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11068)|
| 3:04:35| As the state law says, what's the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11075)|
| 3:04:41| We have to formulate a plan, send it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| They're going to send it back to us approved, not approved, or no position taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11084)|
| 3:04:50| But we've got thousands of acres that need to have some plan implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11090)|
| 3:04:56| and made operational on the basis of this three years of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11096)|
| 3:05:01| And, Mr. Law Director, I'm asking you to prepare something for us for the next agenda to be taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11101)|
| 3:05:11| for action to be taken in relationship to this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11111)|
| 3:05:17| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| Does that need to be in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11120)|
| 3:05:24| That's just a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11124)|
| 3:05:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11127)|
| 3:05:28| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11128)|
| 3:05:29| All I wanted to say was just give Mr. Wolfenbarger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11129)|
| 3:05:33| and Ms. Starbuck a little bit of the background, I guess, related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11133)|
| 3:05:39| I mean, as soon as the vote was taken, I think it was a clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| because of the strength of the vote to deny the Midway Business Park by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11143)|
| 3:05:52| it's clear the sentiment of the body is to take that property out of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11152)|
| 3:06:01| I think it was clearly our intent, the body, speaking of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11161)|
| 3:06:08| to have that 99% of the sector plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11172)|
| 3:06:13| To me, clearly, the owners of the property have been told, we don't want a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11173)|
| 3:06:21| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11181)|
| 3:06:22| This is not an effort to circumvent that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11182)|
| 3:06:28| To me, as soon as the vote was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| and I think Ms. Ray had anticipated this for a number of days or weeks or months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11191)|
| 3:06:39| and she had germinated an idea for some alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11199)|
| 3:06:45| And so she comes today, and I think she's specifically talking about those formulating ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11205)|
| 3:06:55| for that portion of the sector plan, the Midway term, the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11215)|
| 3:07:02| That's where it is, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| And so, you know, I know that Bob's put, you guys have put so much effort into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11224)|
| 3:07:12| and you don't want to see something come in the back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| And I think there's a whole lot of other people that feel that way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11237)|
| 3:07:23| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| I just wanted to say that I completely support Commissioner Wright on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11247)|
| 3:07:32| that we need to move forward and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11252)|
| 3:07:37| The people in this community deserve to have some peace on this issue at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11257)|
| 3:07:43| and if changes need to be made down the road, we can certainly make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11263)|
| 3:07:49| Let me also say that the mayor does not need our approval to form an ad hoc committee to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11269)|
| 3:07:58| He can do it totally on his own, but Mr. Rice came and said the mayor would like your blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11278)|
| 3:08:03| And he said we would just like for you to know that this is what we would like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11283)|
| 3:08:06| we'd like your blessing, and the mayor will appoint the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| We were unanimous in giving them the blessing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| So I assume that we're still unanimous in doing that to let him go ahead and form his committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11292)|
| 3:08:18| This is the mayor's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| And so I think that that's still a good plan to have them look at the Midway Business Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11301)|
| 3:08:26| bringing it up next month I think is entirely proper to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| And so the law director will work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11311)|
| 3:08:32| You know, I guess I really have a question just about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11312)|
| 3:08:36| because we talked today during our chairman's luncheon that we want to avoid spot zoning and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11316)|
| 3:08:44| I know you said if we want to go back and do something, we can just rezone it or resector it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11324)|
| 3:08:50| But if we go ahead and pass this, is there any reason for the mayor to even have this ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11330)|
| 3:08:55| if we're going to do what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| Because of the Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| If the Midway is taken out, the 380 acres, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11339)|
| 3:09:04| But can we approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11344)|
| 3:09:06| I have a question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11346)|
| 3:09:07| I thought that what we couldn't do because we tried to do this once before is that we couldn't pull Midway out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11347)|
| 3:09:13| We either had to approve the sector plan with Midway in it or, you know, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11353)|
| 3:09:19| I mean, I guess I'm really asking more about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| I'm not making a comment on what I agree with or disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11363)|
| 3:09:26| I'm just trying to understand the process better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| Well, I'm just wondering, your proposal to the law director is to do 99 percent and leave out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11369)|
| 3:09:35| Was that what you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| Or are you saying the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| As we had in school today, the planning authority on like a six-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11379)|
| 3:09:48| or seven- or eight-year rotating basis goes from sector to sector to sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11388)|
| 3:09:54| revisiting what may have changed in those sectors since the last plan was implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11394)|
| 3:10:01| And there are 12 sectors, six of them primarily city and six of them primarily county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11401)|
| 3:10:09| but only one that is entirely 100 percent city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| See, I paid attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| They presented their after-exhaustive study plan for the east county sector, the new sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11417)|
| 3:10:31| with all of its amendments and whatever's added and whatever and whatever and whatever, and we said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11431)|
| 3:10:38| And the only reason we said no, majority vote of county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11438)|
| 3:10:43| is because of this one percent of the east county sector plan by majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11443)|
| 3:10:51| We disagreed with its new usage or zoning or whatever you want to refer to that as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11451)|
| 3:10:59| All we could do was say yes or no, approve or deny, and we denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11459)|
| 3:11:06| And it's back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11466)|
| 3:11:08| And there it can lay until the French broad freezes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11468)|
| 3:11:14| The next step, though, is for the legislative body, us, to present our own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11474)|
| 3:11:25| And I am fairly enamored with and in love with the plan as presented by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11485)|
| 3:11:34| along with the majority of commission, except for that one percent or that less than 400 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11494)|
| 3:11:40| or whatever it is we want to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11500)|
| 3:11:42| And we can find a technical name to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| It's the Midway Road location that is owned by the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11504)|
| 3:11:49| And what I would like to see happen is that the plan be made operational as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11509)|
| 3:11:59| with the exception of that piece of property which will remain as it is currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11519)|
| 3:12:05| is zoned a good word, currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11525)|
| 3:12:09| Designated as a land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11532)|
| 3:12:13| Leave it as currently designated land use classification for that one particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11533)|
| 3:12:20| And then the sector plan is away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11540)|
| 3:12:25| It allows all the people to take all those particular parts of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| and go implement them in all those other hundreds of thousands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11549)|
| 3:12:32| well, maybe not hundreds of thousands, but all the other acres of the East County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11552)|
| 3:12:38| But what's still on our plate, what is still before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| is what will ultimately happen to that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11562)|
| 3:12:45| And it will be years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| So there's no need for us to throw out all of this planning and go years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11568)|
| 3:12:56| when we're just talking about this one particular land, piece of land, and its usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11576)|
| 3:13:03| I believe that we do have the right capability, power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11583)|
| 3:13:09| I shouldn't use that word, to address that piece of property at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11589)|
| 3:13:16| And when there is a majority of commission, like whatever land usage is presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11596)|
| 3:13:21| it can be made operational, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11601)|
| 3:13:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11604)|
| 3:13:25| The legislative body has the authority to initiate a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11605)|
| 3:13:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11609)|
| 3:13:30| But that's months, if not years, down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11610)|
| 3:13:34| So let's get on with, at the next meeting, making operational, as we've discussed for years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11614)|
| 3:13:42| the land usage in the East sector plan, based on the current data and information that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11622)|
| 3:13:49| The MPC plan, minus this one particular parcel, which will retain its existing land usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11629)|
| 3:13:59| I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11639)|
| 3:14:03| So the mayor's ad hoc committee could still look at this acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11643)|
| 3:14:12| and come back with a recommendation and it could be implemented down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| So in other words, I don't want citizens to come in and spend an awful lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| and find out that we've just wasted their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| I've been on these committees and I know what it's like to have your time wasted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11663)|
| 3:14:27| and have your stuff put up on a shelf and nobody pay attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11667)|
| 3:14:30| I don't want that to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11670)|
| 3:14:31| So if they're not going to be able to do productive work, then let's put the brakes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| But I just want to make sure that if, indeed, this committee can do some productive work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11675)|
| 3:14:40| and come to us with recommendations that will be seriously considered, then I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11680)|
| 3:14:45| So I just want to make sure from our MPC folks that that can, indeed, happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11685)|
| 3:14:48| And I guess our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11688)|
| 3:14:51| That can, in fact, happen and it would be very comparable to many of the small area plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11691)|
| 3:14:57| that we do within the city on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11697)|
| 3:15:01| where those plans are ultimately adopted as part of the sector plan when they're completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11701)|
| 3:15:07| and they go through the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| Okay. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11709)|
| 3:15:12| I just wanted to say that our perspective has always been that Midway Road, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11712)|
| 3:15:22| I think it's ECO-7, Commissioner Wright, in the 2010 sector plan as it's designated for that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11722)|
| 3:15:30| has always been that that property remain as it is currently zoned in current land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11730)|
| 3:15:43| As with any zoning in the future or rezoning in the future, which this commission does monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11743)|
| 3:15:51| it can be addressed based on the information available at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11751)|
| 3:15:58| As we know currently, the Development Corporation has proposed a business park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11758)|
| 3:16:05| which this commission has, as Commissioner Norman made very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| the majority has said that they don't want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11770)|
| 3:16:15| From the community's perspective, we understand, based on discussions that we had sometime a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11775)|
| 3:16:22| with the mayor, that there has to be some alternative use for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11782)|
| 3:16:28| now that the Development Corporation owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11788)|
| 3:16:31| We respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11791)|
| 3:16:33| We respect it so well that we spent our time and money and effort to come up with an alternative plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11793)|
| 3:16:42| I want to remind the commission that the community feels like that we can recover the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11802)|
| 3:16:48| that the Development Corporation has made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11808)|
| 3:16:51| And if it is the sentiment of this commission that there's not going to be a business park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11811)|
| 3:16:57| Knox County may not want to own this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11817)|
| 3:17:00| If Knox County can recover the $10 million that's invested there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11820)|
| 3:17:04| and maybe even recover the $17 million that's in the bank waiting to be spent there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11824)|
| 3:17:09| for the first phase of development out of three phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11829)|
| 3:17:13| The first phase, I want to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11833)|
| 3:17:19| If we can do that, that might be a viable option for this commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11839)|
| 3:17:24| Now, with regard to an ad hoc committee, someone is going to make recommendations about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11844)|
| 3:17:32| if the county does continue to own that property and a business park is not an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11852)|
| 3:17:37| as we've heard from the commission, then the ad hoc committee will probably be the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11857)|
| 3:17:46| that make recommendations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11866)|
| 3:17:49| But that is a separate process from the sector plan and getting it adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11869)|
| 3:17:57| We encourage you to make the resolution or whatever is appropriate per the law director, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11877)|
| 3:18:05| so that this commission can vote to approve the sector plan as it was presented by the MPC for 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11885)|
| 3:18:15| and leaving the Midway Road slash EC07 as it's currently zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11895)|
| 3:18:21| And then we'll all have an opportunity to address the future use of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11901)|
| 3:18:26| because it's the taxpayers that own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11906)|
| 3:18:29| We keep talking about the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11909)|
| 3:18:31| but its resources came from this body and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11911)|
| 3:18:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11920)|
| 3:18:41| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11921)|
| 3:18:42| Lisa Starbuck, 6233 Babley Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11922)|
| 3:18:46| I would like to echo most of Bob's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11926)|
| 3:18:49| and also say that I'm very disappointed that we didn't know anything about this prior to it happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11929)|
| 3:18:56| It wasn't on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| It wasn't noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11938)|
| 3:18:59| We were at the meeting today and nobody said anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11939)|
| 3:19:03| I was under the impression that you couldn't vote on something unless it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11943)|
| 3:19:08| So I don't know if it got added to the agenda somehow and we missed that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11948)|
| 3:19:13| But anyway, I'd just like to express my disappointment that the people who have a lot invested in this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11953)|
| 3:19:22| you know, didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| And secondly, I would like to say with regard to the sector plan process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11965)|
| 3:19:30| I was very interested to hear today some of the comments that the law director had to make about the sector plan process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11970)|
| 3:19:36| and Mr. Donaldson, and particularly struck me that one comment they made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11976)|
| 3:19:42| and I don't remember which one it was, said the sector plan process is not about a particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11982)|
| 3:19:49| It's about looking at something for the whole region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11989)|
| 3:19:52| Well, I can tell you I've been a part of a lot of sector plan processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11992)|
| 3:19:55| and this is the first and only process that I've ever been involved in where it did revolve around one property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=11995)|
| 3:20:03| Now that property owner and that particular piece of property has driven this whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12003)|
| 3:20:08| and turned something that is normally a six- to nine-month process into a process over several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12008)|
| 3:20:16| And I would also like to say with regard to Mr. Anders' comment about input, this sector plan process, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12016)|
| 3:20:24| took years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| And I think that if you'll go back and look at the records, there was an enormous amount of turnout at every sector plan meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12026)|
| 3:20:35| In fact, it was far greater than any other sector plan process that has ever happened in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12035)|
| 3:20:42| Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Donaldson, but there were an enormous amount of people participated in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12042)|
| 3:20:51| meeting after meeting, year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12051)|
| 3:20:54| And so, you know, I think there has been an adequate amount of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12054)|
| 3:21:01| and it's time to put this sector plan to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12064)|
| 3:21:05| Mr. Anders, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12065)|
| 3:21:06| Yeah, Ms. Starbuck, my opinion wasn't about input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12066)|
| 3:21:09| I think the public has had great input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| My opinion is the property owners in the corridor must be notified if they're going to have a, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12071)|
| 3:21:18| if they're going to have an overlay, if they're going to have a development overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12078)|
| 3:21:21| the people that are in the corridor must agree to that or I can't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12081)|
| 3:21:25| That's just because it diminishes the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| Well, actually, it's not a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12088)|
| 3:21:31| It's just an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| It's kind of like just a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| It doesn't have any teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12095)|
| 3:21:36| It's kind of like your slope protection plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12096)|
| 3:21:39| You know, it doesn't have any real bearing on what you do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12099)|
| 3:21:44| Well, I mean, if the property owner, my opinion is if the property owners are not notified of possible easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12104)|
| 3:21:49| then it shouldn't be, it should not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12109)|
| 3:21:52| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12112)|
| 3:21:54| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12114)|
| 3:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12118)|
| 3:22:01| We did not, this wasn't on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12121)|
| 3:22:04| We didn't vote to create anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12124)|
| 3:22:07| This is the mayor's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| And Dean had come down and asked us if we would support the formation of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12129)|
| 3:22:15| And I don't think any of us have anything against any group getting together to talk about visioning or new ideas or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12135)|
| 3:22:24| But when we asked who would be on the committee and Gloria had said Elaine Clark, at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12144)|
| 3:22:34| I had assumed that people had been informed of this and asked if they wanted to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12154)|
| 3:22:40| And my understanding now is that, Elaine, you had not been approached about this either from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12160)|
| 3:22:47| So, I mean, my ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| I was aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12169)|
| 3:22:52| I did not know anything official at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12172)|
| 3:22:55| I didn't ask if someone was informed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| So the fact that a committee is being formed and the three people who have been most active in fighting the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12180)|
| 3:23:13| had not been discussed with them or they had not been approached or asked to participate, I have concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12193)|
| 3:23:23| There already have gotten communications from people questioning Gloria Ray's affiliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12203)|
| 3:23:30| or relationship to the development corporation, and I just don't want to see this be another big mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12210)|
| 3:23:37| So this isn't something that the commission created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12217)|
| 3:23:41| This is the mayor's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| And I'm sorry now that I didn't ask more questions this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12223)|
| 3:23:51| So that's my mistake, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12231)|
| 3:23:55| But I do hope that going forward, any group that gets together to talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12235)|
| 3:24:00| and all of these meetings I'm assuming will be open and noticed and that anyone can come and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12240)|
| 3:24:07| But I do hope that the mayor or Gloria or whoever is doing this will show some respect for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12247)|
| 3:24:19| and the people who have put the work into this to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12259)|
| 3:24:23| Is there any other business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12263)|
| 3:24:25| Yes, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12265)|
| 3:24:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12266)|
| 3:24:27| Oh, Sam's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12267)|
| 3:24:30| I definitely don't want to belabor this, but it sounds like a lot of the statements out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12270)|
| 3:24:38| sounds like they're somehow conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12283)|
| 3:24:44| Ms. Clark was approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12284)|
| 3:24:47| We pushed Gloria into giving us names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12287)|
| 3:24:51| And so when she gave us names, it's because Ms. Clark was approached but probably not finalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12291)|
| 3:24:58| and she was apprehensive about giving us names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12298)|
| 3:25:02| So she has committed before, into the mic, before the county, that she will have folks from all entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12302)|
| 3:25:13| We have no reason to distrust her or the mayor or anyone else about this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12313)|
| 3:25:19| Now, whether we pass a resolution or not next month, I'm glad to hear it's probably a moot point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12319)|
| 3:25:27| about this committee going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12327)|
| 3:25:30| So, you know, I guess, and then, too, I don't want to let the bloggers run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12330)|
| 3:25:35| Whoever we come up with, Gloria Ray, the Pope, someone's going to have a negative statement to say about that lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12335)|
| 3:25:45| We'll get negative emails about whomever we choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12345)|
| 3:25:49| So, you know, I think, as Commissioner Norman so eloquently put, she's thinking about an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12349)|
| 3:25:59| There will not be a business part brought to this committee for us to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| That's not her charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| It's definitely not her charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12367)|
| 3:26:08| That's not the mandate that came from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12368)|
| 3:26:12| I was on the minority side, but this body spoke clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12372)|
| 3:26:18| And I think the county residents heard that and agreed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| So, you know, for there to be this mindset that somehow something's going to come through the back door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12382)|
| 3:26:28| and we'll end up with a business park in Midway, I think is a little disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12388)|
| 3:26:33| And I'm not saying any one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| I just think that when we start talking about conspiracies and people not wanting what side this chair is coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12395)|
| 3:26:43| we kind of feed that fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12403)|
| 3:26:46| Let's say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12406)|
| 3:26:48| Commission spoke clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| The county residents have spoken clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| This has been a three-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12412)|
| 3:26:55| I think MPC doesn't mind a few months' process, whether this passes or not next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12415)|
| 3:27:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12422)|
| 3:27:04| But don't mind, wouldn't mind a few months' process to allow this conversation to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12424)|
| 3:27:09| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12429)|
| 3:27:10| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12430)|
| 3:27:11| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| You and I are on the same page on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| There's no conspiracy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| Do we have a short comment from the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| Mr. Chairman and Commission, we just want to make clear that we, I don't know anything about a conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12441)|
| 3:27:27| I never implied that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| Never called your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12450)|
| 3:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12451)|
| 3:27:32| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12452)|
| 3:27:34| Nor did Lee Sleeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12454)|
| 3:27:35| To be candid, what we anticipated was is we were, when we heard about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12455)|
| 3:27:41| was that this ad hoc committee might want to do its work before the sector plan gets sent back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12461)|
| 3:27:52| and then ultimately approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12472)|
| 3:27:54| And we don't see them as two components that have to happen at the same time or in sequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12474)|
| 3:28:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12480)|
| 3:28:01| And I think Mr. Donaldson agreed with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12481)|
| 3:28:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12483)|
| 3:28:04| And so we want to make sure that we're not opposed to the ad hoc committee, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12484)|
| 3:28:07| but we don't think the ad hoc committee has to offer its opinion to get the sector plan adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12487)|
| 3:28:12| And we want to make sure that this commission knows that we're not conspiracy theorists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12492)|
| 3:28:20| And, two, we just are very hopeful that this plan can get adopted as Commissioner Wright has articulated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12500)|
| 3:28:27| And thank you for your time and thank you for staying so late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12507)|
| 3:28:30| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| And, Mr. Law Director, in connection to this, do you have, do I need to speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12512)|
| 3:28:38| or do you have the directive here of what, do you have a flavor of the direction that we're headed in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12518)|
| 3:28:48| No, I'd rather Mark Donaldson do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12528)|
| 3:28:53| Could I get, yeah, I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| Can I get you and Mark Donaldson together so that you can prepare in proper form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12535)|
| 3:29:00| that he would be, that he would accept if we subsequently approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12540)|
| 3:29:05| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12545)|
| 3:29:06| We're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12546)|
| 3:29:07| We have watched this consummately from the beginning and all we need is guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| I think we've received that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| We can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12552)|
| 3:29:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| Seeing no other business before the commission, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=12555)|
