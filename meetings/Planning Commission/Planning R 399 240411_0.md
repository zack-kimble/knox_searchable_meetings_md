| 0:19:56| And this is a fairly unusual circumstance we ended up with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| We originally purchased 49 acres of this property back in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| And we got the whole 49 acres approved for four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| When the crash came of 06, 07, 08, we had to start selling off parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| And when we did so, we thought we had ended up with 19.86 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| So we developed the property, went through all the approvals for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| engineering, for subdivision development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| So it was completely developed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| We realized after the fact that we ended up with, after we sold pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| of property, we ended up with 19.46 acres, which left us 0.08 acres in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| excess of the density requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| So we ended up with one more lot than what we should have been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| do with our density and amount of acres that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| And we've done probably 155 subdivisions in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| This is the first time anything like this has ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| We just had a survey error of 0.08 acres, which reduced the density down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| So I'm respectfully requesting if the 1.33 acre lot that you see there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| approved for four units an acre, and actually we need 3.03 technically to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| make it work, we can use the lot, which is an already developed lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Fronts of County Road has water, sewer, electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| It's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| There's houses being built around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| And so I respectfully request for that 1.33 acres be approved so we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| that existing lot in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1301)|

| 0:22:20| used for a single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1340)|

| 0:22:45| the requirement of the use of the lot be a single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Is that good with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1370)|

| 0:24:25| Would you like to proceed or defer your comments, Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| I'll just wait and see what my opposition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1472)|

| 0:24:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Mr. McCart, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Hopefully we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| My name is Matthew McCart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| I live in Ladd Road, the neighborhood right behind that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| 7321 is my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Right behind, just right behind that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| I was concerned about the condos or whatever they're going to build because I have a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| The two houses next to me have a kid, multiple kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| We just didn't want people to look down into our neighborhood, into our yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| We want to feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| We just, you know, I just, that's my concern, the safety of my child and my immediate neighbor's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1525)|
| 0:25:37| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Well, thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| So we're going to build a, put a house on that, one single family dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| and came to MPC and just asked if we could divide this lot off if it met all the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| And they said RA zoning, and so we've kind of divided this lot off to build one home on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| And I think we've met all the requirements of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| So we'd like for you all to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1575)|

| 0:26:21| because it's consistent with the second plan and other development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1581)|

| 0:26:38| These lights, we've got new lights now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1600)|

| 0:27:00| Applicant Douglas Pollack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Location, eastern terminus of Red Hellard Lane, south side of Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| Approximate size of track, .67 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| Present zoning, planned residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Zoning requested, low-density residential, RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, and vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| Staff recommendation is to approve the low-density residential zone because it's consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| And I see the applicant before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| If you'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| My name is Doug Pollack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I live at 10108 Red Hellard Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| And do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| I see some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| And we have Ms. Deanne Young that has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Would you like to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| So, Ms. Young, you're welcome to come up and speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| That's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| And then after you, we'll have Ms. Ada Saffron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Saffron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Deanne Young, 10137 Red Hellard Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I live kind of in the middle of that street, been there 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| and we have 22 children on that small cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| And our big concern is that they want to put mobile homes up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| and it's going to change our neighborhood completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| And we're worried about the safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| and we also don't want any kind of attachment to our street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| like any driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| and it's also listed in our rules that we can't add mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| Or, yeah, it's supposed to be restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| But anyways, our main concern is we just don't want access there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| and it's stated in our rules that we can't have mobile homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| or driveways added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| And mainly the safety of our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| because we have crime that comes from the mobile homes back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| that we have had people banned from the police from them coming to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| And the kids in our neighborhood, it's a very unique neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| They play from sunup to sundown, very safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| And, yeah, we just don't want to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| And our street is really small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| It's not like we can take on any extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Ms. Safran, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| My name is Aida Safarian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| I live on 10109 Red Hillard Lane since June of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| We have, we share the cul-de-sac with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| We learned about the rezoning, as Deanne just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| We strongly against of additional easement through their property to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| property they try to rezone right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| I also want to point out that the property that they want to rezone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| not part of the Red Hillard Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| It has an address of 122 Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| It has an access from Rob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| There is existing access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| and we would suggest that they would continue to use the access that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| is on the street right now on Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| Our street, Red Hillard Lane, it is very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Our neighborhood, which is Hunter Points, has restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| We have these restrictions here, and based on those restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| nobody living in the neighborhood can change the structure of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| neighborhood or place additional easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| and this is what the applicant is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| It also says that they cannot have mobile homes or trailers in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| so we don't want 122 Bob Gray Street to be part of Red Hillard Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| because it changes the whole structure of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| and based on our neighborhood restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| it should not be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| It is illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| and then we don't want additional traffic through our street to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| It shouldn't be connected because of the safety of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| As Dan just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| we have 22 children who safely play in that area of the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| They ride bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| They ride scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| They like skateboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Our street is very short to have additional traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| and it will compromise the safety of our children, we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| So my family's lived there in Hunter's Point neighborhood for over 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1911)|

| 0:31:55| When the opportunity presented itself to buy some land next to us and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| builder was moving out, we decided to purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| We've owned the land now for over three years and have contemplated what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| to do with it and are trying to explore our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Originally, when we moved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| there was a small house and trailer on the lot with access to Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| This access currently does not show on the property report since it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| determined it would need to be fixed with the grading and verify site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| distances to meet the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| which we would need to review with the county to allow safe access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| lot from Bob Gray, which we plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| The lot was completely cleared as the builder of the Dutchtown Woods was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| finished with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| As we considered our possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| some of the early discussion with Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| it was unclear what could be built there under the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| We had been told conflicting information about the PR allowances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| and it wasn't until we had submitted the rezoning and the sign was posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| it was found out that some of the options were allowed in the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| Through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| we felt the RA rezoning would eliminate any future confusion and also open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| This process is about what the zoning makes the most sense for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| as well as the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| This is a unique property because we're between a neighborhood and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| a RB and a BP park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| Trying to see what the most useful purpose of the land was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| rezoning to RA gives us basically the least amount of confusion of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| could be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| We still have to do plan permits and everything to decide the final version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| but the RA zone seems to offer the least confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Then also based on the other criteria of the land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| the RA low density residential zone reduces the building and does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| negatively impact the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| It's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| It is also consistent with the adjacent properties and would fit into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| current density of the zone in this case of five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Thanks for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| And you'll have to forgive me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| With the rain, I couldn't hear everything you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| But so am I understanding you guys own the trailer park next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| No, we own the lot number nine up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| The one on one red one on one eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| So you live in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| So now I guess my question would be for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| I think Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Oh, well for staff then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| So is this, it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| it looks to me like that land is not technically part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| Hunter's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Or can staff speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| So it was rezoned at the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| It was part of the rezoning and was owned by a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| by the developer of the subdivision to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| But I don't think it's technically part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| it doesn't have access to the internal streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Like they didn't have a driveway extending down to the cul-de-sac and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| that neighborhood or anything that was set aside by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| So, yeah, I guess my, my question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| there was some discussion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| of neighborhood restrictions that don't allow certain things and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| like that. But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| I would, with that being said, I would assume that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| those restrictions that aren't on, on this part of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| Now I would question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| because it looks like it is part of a Dutch town woods or at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| it was part of that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| which is the one to the south that Mike was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I think, I don't know what the restrictions are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| And did they carry over into, to those lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| I don't know. I did get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| some calls from neighbors there that were very concerned about drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| Are you familiar with any drainage issues coming down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| We had talked to some sort of landscapers or people to clear the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| And they basically said they would try to push the water towards the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| and use the drain that's on the, are in front of our house on one zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| one zero eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| So the water would drain towards that, that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Okay. And so I guess that to be a question for engineering, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| just rezoning something to RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Would these require any sort of drainage improvements or anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| for the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I think if he only built two single family homes on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| it wouldn't require any type of stormwater management plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| I would add there is a large drainage way between on the back of nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| sixty five that goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| Keep going. And there's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| there's a large pipe that goes out under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Yeah. Right in that area there. There's a, there's a large drainage way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| You can see the distance between those houses. It goes out and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| So there is, there is a pretty good drainage channel between those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Okay. So do you, do you have any idea of what your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| your plans are for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| For right now, the first option was of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| trying to use it as a two at single dwelling homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| We talked about pre-manufactured homes, if that was even a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| I'm trying to determine what's the best use for that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Since of the proximity to the parks, it was a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| The idea now would be is we're trying to get access to Bob gray based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| And then we would have to level and try to build up the driveway into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| from the Bob gray based on some of the recommendations made by the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| by the Knox County planning. So eventually we were trying to use that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| but we still wanted to give ourselves options to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| if we were going to build two family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| we would use the entrance from the, from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Cause it's quieter. It makes sense. You can still fence it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| We pull in from the, from the main road. It opens up more options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| how to access both lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| I've got some questions along the same lines as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| If the usages you were describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| you said you wanted to keep an option open to be able to access the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| Hillard lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Doesn't that conflict with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| the rules of that neighborhood to create a new driveway into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I don't, I don't know if there is such a, I mean, right now it's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| it was a potential for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| We'd still have to ask or request for permits if that's what we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| do, but we wanted to give it piece of our land for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| As it being a potential future to use that as a potential entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| So my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| the point of my question is that from the drawing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| you know, the yellow line is marking out this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| It makes it look very much like it is to be connected to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| And if that's the case, then it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| that's the terminus of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| And you have very consistent building architectural building patterns for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| So to terminate and have that be something different, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| it makes sense if you're connecting it to the park beside it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| it doesn't really make sense for the neighborhood that it's connecting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| So I'm, I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| And that's why I'm trying to figure out how to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| If your access is confidently to Bob gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| then it does seem very clear. Like it's not connected to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| That neighborhood has a cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| but just has a butts this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| And you could do something with landscape buffers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| to prevent any kind of confusion there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| but this sort of nebulous leaving that option open is concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| And that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| so if there are any other points that you'd like to make along that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| or if staff has anything else they'd like to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| You know, again, I mean, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| the zoning fits the actual plan and adding two more homes to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| whether you're in a, in a newer neighborhood or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| if we were to make the architecture the same or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| or similar price point of the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| I don't see how that would be a demerit or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| or a concern why you wouldn't allow that as being additional homes in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| neighborhood that would fit the same criteria as far as the height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| the cost of the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| as well as the style of the houses to me that it makes sense that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| be a possibility for us. I mean, again, we're trying to explore options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| That was one of the options was either try to utilize that area for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| additional homes that we could do in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| or try to give access and give the access to Bob gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| But based on the recommendations for the grading and everything that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| be required there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| we'd have to do some additional investigation to make sure that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| possibility. So the RA going to rezone to the RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| just gives us the opportunity to see what else is option to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| If we can do it ourselves or if we have to get somebody who can contract at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| work, but that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| that's sort of what we're trying to think about with using that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Mike, can I ask you about if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| if we were to move forward with the RA zoning that would allow the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| to build out as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| as he wishes based in that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| that would mean he potentially has access to Heller lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| It would mean he potentially has access to Bob gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| just as we're looking at the case at the moment. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| I don't think anything really changes between keeping the plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| zoning and they are RA in regards to access or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| There's really not much difference between the two zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| I guess I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| I feel like, well, I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| I understand you wanted to have options if this is what it wasn't originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| part of this neighborhood. And it's now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| just being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| we've had neighbors say that there's potentially something in their bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| that say you can't put in a new driveway. I don't know the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| the facts of that or not, but I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| I'm okay with this movement to the new zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| but with some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| And that would be to not have access to that Heller and potentially put in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| landscape buffer there to help protect that neighborhood from this unexpected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| change in how that property is being used. I do want to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I think we're some other people wanting to talk. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| So we've got these little red halos now. Yeah. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| They are hard to see, but that's our new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| So let's go with commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| I have some similar questions, I guess, for related to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| but I do want to clarify due to the size of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| this could only handle three dwelling units. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Steph. Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| Yeah. I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Due to the size, both of these lots could only handle three dwelling units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| I believe that the two lots now are above 12,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| So one of them is there is about 13 and a half thousand square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| The other one is about 14 and a half thousand square feet for a duplex and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| other one is about 14 and a half thousand square feet for a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| So that's a lot of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| So for a duplex to be considered in, in the RA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| it only needs 12,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| So it would have to come through use on review though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| So the planning commission would have to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| But single family houses would be permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| But if they combined these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Under the current zoning. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| I mean, they'd be able to do multiple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Well, now under the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Under the existing zoning, they could do multiple units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| Because it's five billion is per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| So whatever the acreage is, but that times that under the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| Doing the maximum they could do is two units per lot because that's a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| for a lot. So it'd be four maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| And I wanted to clarify that just because it does seem like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| Maybe there's concerns of, of multiple houses being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| a lot of houses being put here or a continuation of the adjacent park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| So it does seem like it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Even with this kind of a minimal possible scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| I would like for staff to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| I know a couple of people have already asked for clarification regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Relationship to the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| When I look at a plat and, you know, we can see it on the map here that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| There is that connection. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| One thing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| I would be concerned about would just be the moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| You know, if the neighborhood feels like there is a violation of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| Their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| They may pursue a court route to try to mitigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Maybe to prevent that for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I would like to kind of hear more about the access to the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| I'll defer to director stone, but on the plat, you'll note that it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| it does not allow access to Bob gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| It's dated on the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| So we would have to go through the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Unless engineering wants to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| There's a note on the plat that limits access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Red Hillard lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| That was due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| That was due to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| They were saying the grading had to be proved before they could give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| access to Bob gray, which we're planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| They had their grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| The raise of the lot would have to come up to Bob gray road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| And then the site distances would have to be checked and confirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| But we would have to do that in order to get the access to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| to the, to Bob gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Do y'all have any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| We would have to see the plan to see what he's proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Do you think that it's possible for that to be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| If the grade was brought up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| I think if they could attain site, site distance, we would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| No other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| No commissioner commissioner bigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Just a question on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Comes change from PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| If it was to remain PR with like a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| come back in front of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| If there are concerns about kind of the final site plan and layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| And so kind of just curious if that could be a solution or if that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| considered, could we keep it PR so that we could get a second look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Next question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Well, so the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| That this lot was part of was approved for single family houses and had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| You know, if they were doing single family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| I think they would just move forward since the lots were already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| If they want to do anything other than single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| then it would have to come back to the board planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| For the staff recommendation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| RA fits within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| I think that the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| Ability for us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Have to look at a concept plan for any special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| If they wanted to move forward with two single family residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| connecting to a subdivision of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| 16 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| I don't think that's going to overburden that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| In some ways, I think it could be, you know, a good addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| And so I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| I'd like to make the motion to approve RA because it's consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| the sector plan and surrounding development per staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| RA per staff recommendation by commissioner shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| So seconded by commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| We still have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| So commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| This is a question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Historical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Just I thought the applicant said that the property used to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| access to Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| And then that went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| So I guess my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| How did, how did it have access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| And then it went away and now we're concerned that it can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| It had access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| So when they subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| now they have to meet the new access control policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| which would mean they have to get site distance and meet all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| requirements of the access control policy because of the replanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| and their creation of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| It had one home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| It was a lot of record prior to the plot being recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| I just want to confirm with the motion that's on the floor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| If that passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| this body does get to see that again and has an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| address some of the concerns that we've talked about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| And currently meaning access into the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| landscape buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Is that true or not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| Only if a special usage request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| So under the RA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| we wouldn't know that there's no conditions of like for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| If it stays PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| if it's a single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| we wouldn't see it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| If you wanted to add conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| I would do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| but was off on what you're trying to ask there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| But no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| I think that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Shelton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| you made that motion and you were saying you didn't think it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| If there were two structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| three structures that then had access into that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| how does that function with what commissioner Higgins was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| that if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Access into the neighborhood is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| that given the bylaws or laws of their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| then there's a whole legal concern that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| That's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| I think historically we haven't really considered like covenants and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| things of that nature with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| That's for the courts to decide in the event they act on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| that would be in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| So we're just staying confined to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| is the zoning appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| And I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| it's a county road and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| my thinking was just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| to help make sure that after today's vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| when everyone goes home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| that they kind of know what hopefully kind of what the future could look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Hopefully talk to each other and figure out a good solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| But if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| if it's currently unable to access anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| but that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I don't know that we have any other choices that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| may decide to access the other road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| but I don't think that there is a legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| outside of our purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| but just for the opposition sake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| letting them know that it doesn't seem like there's really a strong legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| reason to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| to prevent something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| there are conditions that I would place if route one was taken or route two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| but not knowing what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| I have difficulty being able to articulate specific conditions that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| like to place on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| So for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| I'm not going to support this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3142)|

| 0:58:27| and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| you're not dealing with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| environmental constraints properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| Reasoning of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| I guess another justifiable reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| of the plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| at two units per acre is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| so we have general commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| and then on the other side of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| is the channel point subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| which obviously has a lesser density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| This could serve as a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| which is often what we look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| in a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| and then step down to a less intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| before going to a lesser intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| this is completely appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| and could serve as that transitional buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| If you could pull up a different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| a new KGIS map screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| I was going to ask you to look at something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| that I think would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| for comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| The address is 2213 Lake Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| This is an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| located around Duncan Boat Dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Duncan Marina there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| in the River Bend area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| And why I bring this up for comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| is this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| located deep into River Bend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| has a zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| a plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| This is a higher end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| cotton medium townhouse development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| The developable footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| is about seven acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| based on my calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| which appears to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| at 2.75 to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| which is obviously more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| than we're requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3593)|

| 0:59:56| Anybody familiar with this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| would not say that this is out of characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| with the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| As you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| there are larger lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3603)|

| 1:00:17| designation under the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| and it's completely similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| and has the same characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| that our property does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| What it doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| is as intensive a commercial use next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3626)|

| 1:01:22| I see my longtime friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3682)|

| 1:01:26| Rich Levinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| is on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| I'll share a little known fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| that is that Congressman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Jimmy Duncan never considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| retirement from politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| until Rich Levinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| played a practical joke on him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| at the Avalon golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| And that's all I'll say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| As a resident of Channel Point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| we've had great concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| over traffic flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| Choteau area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| that continues to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| And I know people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| have certainly tried to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| that as has Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| We have a five lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Concord Road that dumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| into a two lane North Shore road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| So there's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| no way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| making North Shore wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| But we continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| struggle with development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| on Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| blind hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| We have a lot of sharp curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| And actually from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| early road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| to the end of the peninsula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| if there were an accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| on Choteau Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| you've got hundreds of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| out there that are basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| captive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| They can't get out until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| the Choteau is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| And that could take a while in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| the event of an accident or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| So it is a concern to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| the residents out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| The development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| that's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I don't know if we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| apples and apples if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| talk about Duncan Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| and the Choteau area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| I'll just leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| We favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| which as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| is 25 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3811)|

| 1:05:45| compatible and consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| with what we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| then I don't really see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| where townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| or condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| would fit the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| And quite honestly, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| have a lot of large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3959)|

| 1:06:05| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| kind of like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| saying, if the camel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| toe gets under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| then that could be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| beginning of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| that would really be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| disastrous for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3975)|

| 1:06:17| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| a lot of people in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3979)|

| 1:06:32| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| I was going to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| something about buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3995)|

| 1:06:37| saved for later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=3997)|

| 1:06:58| Vice-Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| I'll take a stab at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| just a couple questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| You know, I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| it's a unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| develop around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| Typically, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| know, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| what you would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| see, and that's what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| would want to see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| more of a master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| plan type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| cohesive walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| type community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| And so I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| there's some merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| with the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| residential zone and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| how it attaches to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| But I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| some density that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| would be able to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| back through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| existing subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| So I guess my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| question here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| it might sound a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| little geeky on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=4080)|

| 1:32:25| Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5545)|

| 1:32:29| Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| We live on Rosemary Creek, it's the back of our property, and I think that the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| Commission has something going on for Rosemary Creek as part of their Rosemary Creek project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| Like I think Article 13 affects Rosemary Creek right there on Shot Town Road where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| You know, they've got this trail they're going to take along all the creeks so everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| can go and enjoy everybody's creek and everything, and it runs in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| So that's going to take about at least 20 to 30 feet off from the creek up of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| How many houses do they want to put on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| This is a rezoning, so we won't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| We won't see that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| The lots up there, they're like 110 feet long and like 90 to 110 feet wide, so you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| put a lot of houses on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| I think they have two there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| The lot they bought owns the log cabin which sits down on the creek, which I'm sure when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| the Rosemary project comes through, that log cabin will have to be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| And like I said, nobody else has but one house on those little skinny lots out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5621)|
| 1:33:51| I just wanted to know what his plans were, whether he's going to put five or six on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| lot or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Do we want to wait until he can show up to tell us something, or what would y'all like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| No, this is just the rezoning phase here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| So now RA will limit, and I'll let Ms. Porche speak to that, what the limitations are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5642)|
| 1:34:11| RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| So the RA zone allows single family homes by right and with a 10,000 square foot minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| This property, all of those together equate to 1.71 acres, so he could by right feasibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| do seven single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| If he wanted to do a duplex, it would require a 12,000 square foot minimum lot size, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| means he could put up to six duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| I don't think he would get that because of the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| There are probably other concerns, but by the zoning, that would be the maximum that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| he could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| I live on the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| When we get anything over 45 inches, the creek, here's the creek where it is, the creek comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| up that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| It runs like the Colorado River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| You cannot even go close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| It's so scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| And then it comes up in the yards about 40 to 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| You can't put houses down there, five or six condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| We don't know at this stage what he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| That just is what the zoning allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| So I will say that as part of the permitting process, they do look at stormwater and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| like that, and each property, each development is required to meet the stormwater regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| So that's all looked at during that stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| But as far as what the applicant intends to do, we don't have that information at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Well, do you know anything about the creek project that's coming up through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| I cannot speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| I'd have to defer to my county colleagues for information on their projects down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| I don't believe it's a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| I believe we remapped the FEMA floodway through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| So the floodway would also control how many houses could be built here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| So they'd have to build one foot above the 500, so it looks to me like a good percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=5743)|
