| 0:00:21| and I'd like to ask Mayor Brown if he would lead us in the invocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=21)|

| 0:02:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| I know we have a few commissioners and council members that are planning to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| so I'm sure they'll trickle in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| I guess the welcome to the public forum and next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| and I think our first matter of business is to address the issue of how many minutes we allot speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| And also we have a request from the chamber on a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| So I think we have a couple of different opinions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| We currently have nine speakers signed up, two of which are chamber speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| And I'd just like to throw it open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| Any comments on allowing the chamber an allotted amount of time for a presentation of Plan B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=174)|
| 0:03:02| versus going along the lines of just allotting signed-up speakers an amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Mr. Chairman, I think that it would be wise for us to stick with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| which was essentially a public forum with designated time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| If representatives of the chamber want to speak, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| But I would object to an allotted, expanded amount of time for a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| We didn't plan on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| This is a public forum, and I think that would be contrary to the intent of the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Well, I respect my colleagues' comments, but we've been sent over the last week or so Plan B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| and some comparisons that we just got today, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| But it seems to me like a number like 15 minutes or something that's modest in size would be appropriate to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| and understand what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| But I'll defer to my colleagues if they want to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| How much time do they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| I think it's 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Okay, 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| I agree with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Maybe everybody will have 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Maybe everybody will have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| If they have two people signed up and they combine their time, that might fill in the allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| But I would not support having a special presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| We've had a facilitator, and everyone had an opportunity to meet with the facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| and we did have agreed rules when we began this investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| I would agree with Councilman Della Vopi as far as having a presentation, if that's part of their time allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| I think anyone who is signed up to speak can get up and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| and say whatever they would like to about any particular plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| but I object to a presentation of this entire plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| For one thing, we don't even know who was involved in putting this plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| We've been here all this time discussing a plan that we knew where it came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| and who worked on it and what was involved, and that's a big part of it, at least for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| So everybody's got their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| They can get up and say what they want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| but I am opposed to a specific presentation of Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Yes, I would be in favor of sticking with the original format where people just signed up for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| If particular people want to join their time together, that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| But otherwise, I would just stick with the original format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| Commissioner Norman, is that a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Yes, that's a new light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| I think that also a complication here is that we haven't had time to look at this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| This was not part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| I mean, we just went through the facilitated process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| and we agreed as bodies to go through this public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| This is a variation of what the bodies decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| And so it would give, I mean, I haven't looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| I mean, I haven't studied it thoroughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| but what I've seen is there are significant things that significant parts of this vary from our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=401)|
| 0:06:52| I consider this a topic that we should probably talk about after the forum is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=412)|
| 0:07:01| how we're going to address this Plan B, what the bodies want to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| rather than allow its presentation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| It's somewhat giving some consent in some form to allow the presentation to even take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| So I think the bodies need to talk about the status of the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| and whether it's when and how we're to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| if we're to include that in our processing now even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| Otherwise, I don't know what we've done in the facilitated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| So I would say, fine, let them have their five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| or however many representatives from the chamber want to speak for five minutes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| Let me ask you, two people in the chamber have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| That's ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Can you make your presentation, not presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| can you make your remarks in ten minutes as opposed to 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| That way we're fair to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| We would prefer to, in addition to those two, to sign up Michael Edwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| and Garrett Wagley, who are also here and who are involved in putting together this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| I would note that we have attended every meeting, every joint workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| and have had the opportunity to speak one time for five minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| We would have welcomed the opportunity to have input into this process as you went forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| but this is the first time we've had the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| We're fine with that, but it's not like we've been here and not been commenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| So if we could sign up two additional people, I think that solves the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| We'll try to finish it in less time than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Okay, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| As a councilman, I think that obviously they're going to have 20 minutes now to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| so we're talking about this and wasting time anyway, so why don't we, if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| we can go ahead and have a vote or we can just go ahead and allot the chamber 15 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| and let one speaker try to be more concise and present it in an orderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| and in a fashion that might be beneficial to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| But I'll remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Any more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| So would you like to take a vote, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| I mean, to me, if they're going to have 20 minutes, four speakers, we might as well give them 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| Want to have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| I'll just go ahead and have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| All those in favor in allotting the chamber 15 minutes to make a presentation, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| I believe the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Ms. Wilson, what order do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Who's the first speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=585)|
| 0:10:00| Casey Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| If you could please come to the microphone and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| My name is Casey Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| I live at 5416 Cedar Heights Road, Knoxville 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| I'm speaking today on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| I serve on the League's Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Our President, Jamie Jobs, is in Nashville and asked me to speak on her behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| The League of Women Voters has watched closely over the years it has taken to create the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| And we commend the task force for conducting an open and inclusive dialogue while formulating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| We also commend Council and Commission for the care and attention given to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| both separately and in these historic joint sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| You have done due diligence in consideration of this plan, and it is time to approve it and move on to the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| The League has conducted its own study of local land use issues and has adopted a position statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| We feel the Hillside Plan is consistent with our policy, so we support the plan as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| At the previous joint session, Commissioner Norman offered revisions to clearing and density limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| These revisions are a reasonable compromise in light of concerns raised during your deliberations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| and the League supports the amended version of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| In contrast to this reasonable compromise, the Chamber has offered a radically rewritten plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| that weakens protections, eliminates incentives, and fundamentally alters the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| By proposing drastic changes this late in the process, the Chamber insults the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| the governing bodies, and all citizens who have participated up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| That is sufficient reason for you to dismiss their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Examining the proposal's contents raises additional concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| Not only do they propose significant weakening of clearing and density limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| they give the city and county engineering departments authority to disregard the limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| It is the Metropolitan Planning Commission, not the engineering departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| that has the staff and expertise needed to make such decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| As has been noted by all sides, the engineering departments are already overworked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| and understaffed in their enforcement responsibilities, so giving them new planning duties makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| Engineering departments are headed by political appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| so implementation and interpretation of these powers would change when administrations change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| bringing uncertainty and inconsistency into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| When power to grant exceptions to the law is given to political appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| it opens the door for favoritism and corruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| Note also that city council and county commission are currently the final arbiters on planning decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| so a shift in the power to the engineering departments is an erosion of your own powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| The League of Women Voters requests that you reject the Chamber's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| and instead support the existing plan with the amendments suggested by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Robin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| Is there a Robin Hill who signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Okay, we'll move to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Dan Jerrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=807)|
| 0:13:40| Can you give us your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| It's 4-50, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| My name is Dan Jerrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| I live at 2101 Johnsonville Highway, PO Box 20084, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| I've been following this issue since late last year when the Metropolitan Planning Commission rolled this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=834)|
| 0:14:04| Basically, it was the first time that I had heard about this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| It's been going on for two years, and I don't believe that the property owners have been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| I guess it was noted in this plan that this plan would not prevent water towers, electricity transmission towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| tree harvesting or protected farming practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| What this plan does is to create more government rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| and regulation that will only apply to a fraction of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| and county property owners who were never notified of this change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| What strikes me is the things that, you know, that the plan does not address at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| and I would like to know the following information if I were sitting where you are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| It's my opinion that these bodies should have requested this in the form of a report and not a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| because that is what you got was just a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| but there are no supporting documents or evidence to support that this plan will do anything but add more layers of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=906)|
| 0:15:16| The questions that I have for this body, and maybe you should be asking the questions too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| from a legal perspective, the city and county attorneys have stated that the plan, should it be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| will pass muster with the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| A legal analysis prepared by the Chamber of Commerce identified four defects which may open the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| and county to legal challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| They are the MPC plan exceeds the scope of an amendment to the general regional plan permitted by statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| which authorizes adoption of a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| The MPC plan was not adopted in the manner required by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| The terms of the MPC plan are not sufficiently certain and definite to satisfy constitutional requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| and the process used for adoption of the MPC plan did not provide the constitutionally required due process notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| to the affected property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| I would add that the supposed public participation through the task force was merely a farce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| The task force may have held meetings over two years, but was disbanded, and the plan was written by the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| and therefore the comments of the public who were in attending of the task force meetings were deprived of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| opportunity to inform the people who wrote the plan of their objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| Regardless of the perceived merits of the Chamber's legal analysis, anyone can sue anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| And my question to this body is, after being informed of these potential risks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| do you have a duty and a responsibility to mitigate the potential risk and litigation through appropriate action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| Are you as our representatives responsible to perform risk analysis of a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| and in doing so protect citizens from litigation to the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| You might have been informed of the alleged legal defect of failure to notify the affected property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| Would you consider it a fiduciary responsibility to inform those individuals for the finite cost of $17,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| rather than to fight through a legal battle on that point, which is an unknown number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| Do you feel that you have a responsibility to protect everyone's property rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| Are you willing to commit the resources of your city and county governments to defend the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Are you willing to commit taxpayer dollars should a suit be filed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| Are you willing the long-term, what will be the long-term potential costs of the litigation estimated to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1059)|
| 0:17:49| if somebody should bring a suit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| What are the common features of the process of this plan and the 10-year plan that ended so badly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| I've heard all the technical discussions regarding slope and density and easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| What offends me is the attitude that this body has about the property rights of these individual owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| Beyond that, what I haven't heard discussed is the extreme slope of 50 percent is basically unusable land in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1088)|
| 0:18:16| Forty-five seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Will all the people have their taxes rolled back to zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Will my property, which may be affected if it has one house per acre to one house per two acres, have a 50 percent reduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| Those are the sort of things that are not, have not been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| And I believe that if you were discussed, if these had been reported to you in depth, that we would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| this would have taken a whole different turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Alex Ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| That's Axel Ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| It's 456.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, Commissioner Norman, for that correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| My name is Axel Ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Actually, I am a resident of Jefferson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| but I am the conservation chair of the Harvey Broome Group of the Sierra Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| and I am representing our approximately 1,000 members that reside in Knox County and Knox City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1154)|
| 0:19:28| You council members and county commissioners represent approximately 423,000 people living in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1168)|
| 0:19:43| I would hope that you take into consideration all of those people's rights and interests rather than the interests of some special interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1183)|
| 0:19:58| who have a direct financial interest in how this plan either becomes accepted or does not become accepted or becomes modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1198)|
| 0:20:13| I am not going to go into any details about the plan that has been presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| You know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| At least I hope you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| You have had ample time to read through it, to discuss it, to analyze it, to debate its merits and its flaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1222)|
| 0:20:33| You also know that this is not a takings issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| This is not about private property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| This is about a vision for the city and the county and about protecting the land and about protecting the people that live on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1241)|
| 0:20:53| The plan B that was presented to you by the Chamber of Commerce that was presented at the end of last week at the 11th hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1253)|
| 0:21:06| or I should say at the 11th hour and 59th minute, cuts the protected area in half right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1266)|
| 0:21:20| I have not had time or the opportunity to actually read through that plan and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| but the short glance that I had at it this afternoon, which was the first time I had a chance to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1288)|
| 0:21:37| indicates to me that its primary purpose is to preserve the profits of the business and developer community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1297)|
| 0:21:48| It does not serve to protect the interests of the people and the land in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1308)|
| 0:22:00| A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to drive through a portion of western North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| As you know, that's a fairly mountainous area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| It struck me as I was driving down Route 74 and I was going up an 8% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| Now keep in mind that the hillside and ridgetop protection plan only kicks in at 15% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| At that 8% grade, my car had to gear down to try to maintain speed going up it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1345)|
| 0:22:34| That was one hell of a steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| That's steeper than the Federal Highway Administration allows for federal highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| and yet the Chamber and the developer community wants to let anything up to 30% be unregulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1362)|
| 0:22:54| I submit to you that on behalf of the 423,000 and some odd people that you support and vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1374)|
| 0:23:11| and achieve a consensus for the hillside and ridgetop protection plan as modified by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1391)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Renee Hoyos, you can give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| It's 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| My name is Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| I'm the Executive Director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| Our address is 625 Market Street, 8th Floor, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Reading the Knox, the Chamber's Plan B makes me sad, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| It feels like a mean-spirited attempt to overturn a process that the Chamber actually participated in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| There were well over 100 meetings to create the original plan along with several public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| Why is it that we're hearing these concerns from the Chamber now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| They had plenty of opportunity to introduce these ideas during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| I ask the County Commission and City Council to dismiss this plan because it's ill-conceived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| TCWN opposes the 100 percent clearing of slopes up to a 30 percent grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| In our experience, developers can hardly keep their sites contained on far less steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| We know that a 30 percent slope will not be adequately protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| Furthermore, according to the maps the Chamber provided in Plan B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| there will be 100 percent clearing of all of our steepest slopes except for their very tippy tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| TCWN opposes office and commercial development above a 15 percent grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| and is on the record stating that position from the last round of hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| The new plan appears to allow office and commercial development up to 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| and above 50 percent if the proper paperwork is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| In our experience, what is on paper and what gets built may be two entirely different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| Often the built project is the worst project and once it's built, it will never be taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| The density definition appears to apply only to residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Office and commercial development are required to meet the development standards set forth in Plan B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| but with no density definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Is the Chamber suggesting that office and commercial development have no limits on steep slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| This plan will open a Pandora's box for poor development on steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| visible to all and far less charming than a water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| It will open the door for more private property damage of downstream downslope property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| While TCWN respects private property rights, landowners do not have the right to harm their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| Developing on steep slopes has the potential for downstream property damage due to slope slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| as we have seen in recent months during severe storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Please do not move forward on the Chamber's Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Casey Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1567)|
| 0:26:18| I'll sign that twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| David Vandergriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1580)|
| 0:26:30| David Vandergriff, 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| I've spoken to this body several times in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| and I wish to speak this time about one specific aspect of this whole plan and revised Plan B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1598)|
| 0:26:48| and that is speaking from the viewpoint of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| Trees have real utility value, ecological utility value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| and that value has just been quantified for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| in a recently completed urban forestry management plan using I-Tree Streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| I-Tree Streets is a program that's developed by the U.S. Forest Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| that's used across the country to quantify ecological benefits of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| Plan B allows for 100 percent clearing and removal of these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| To put this in terms of real terms from real neighborhoods throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| the annual benefit per tree ranges from $123 down to $44 at the low end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1653)|
| 0:27:44| Of that total benefit per tree, stormwater benefits account for a range of $44 down to $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1664)|
| 0:27:54| The ecological benefits come from large trees, not from small trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| So if you remove all the large trees and simply plant some small trees, these ecological benefits aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| This is real dollar value to the city of Knoxville and to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| that would be lost whenever you clear 100 percent of the site to allow for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1693)|
| 0:28:21| So I hope that you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| I know city council will be presenting this entire plan here in the next couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and I hope those of you from county commission will attend the meetings where this information is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| so you can learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| Give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| It's 505.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| My name is Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| My address is 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| And thank you very much for allowing us to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I'm the president of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| And at the April meeting of the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| a representative from each of the following 23 neighborhoods voted unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| to support the existing proposal for the hillside and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| Those neighborhoods were Ashley Oaks, Belmont West, Charlestown Landing, Cobblestone Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| Crestline, Crestwood Hills, Foxfire, Graywood Clusters, Gulf Park, Gulfwood, Highgate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| Highlands at North Shore, Carnes Community Club, Kintzer Farms, Lake Ridge, Lions Crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| New Kensington, North Shore Landing, Sherman Oaks, Tenrera West, View Harbor, Wayne Province, and the woods at Bluegrass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1778)|
| 0:29:48| Since that time, in almost each meeting, monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| we have discussed the hillside and ridgetop plan to some degree or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| and three more neighborhoods have voted to support the plan as it was actually written before even amendments were added by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1797)|
| 0:30:06| The three that have since voted since April to support the plan are Statesview, Farrington, and Seven Oaks East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1806)|
| 0:30:18| The position of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners is that the people who own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| adjacent to steep hillsides and ridgetops are the ones who should be considered most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1824)|
| 0:30:33| They have a right to not have their property flooded by runoff and to not have their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| particularly those that are downslope, devalued when steep slopes behind them or beside them are stripped of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| with little regard for how it will affect their privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| I don't have that much to say today except to ask that you approve this plan with the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| that were added by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| We are not land speculators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| We are current homeowners, taxpayers, and voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| We would like to maintain our property rights today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| and we want to see our tax dollars used for more parks and greenways and better schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| instead of used to clean up floodwaters and to dredge creeks that are choked with muddy runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| Trouble spots like this exist all over the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| and they were caused by either poor land management or made worse because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| There's been a lot said recently about how Knox County needs to attract new industry and jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| and the Council of West Knox County Homeowners completely agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| But we think that to become serious about bringing in new business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| we need to start paying more attention to what makes this area a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| And it's 505, and you have up to 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| My name is Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike, Suite 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| Council and commission put together a task force and asked MPC to assist that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| And what they asked them to do was to prepare a study of ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| and hillside protection measures outlining the alternatives for new codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| and programs for conservation of these important natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| The chamber 100 percent supports that concept and that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| That's not what you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| What you got was an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| You got one document, one legal item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| You did not get alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| You did not get codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| You did not get programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| You got a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| We're prepared to support a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| While it's not what you asked for and we don't think it was the right place to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| the chamber is prepared to support a chamber amendment as long as it is reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and understandable and enforceable and it balances the right of the community's interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| with the rights of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Very straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| We think that a plan must include protection of hillsides and lower-lying property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| and watersheds from slope failure and erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| It should protect the scenic views, which is what you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| And what Mr. Donaldson told you at the last meeting, this plan does not address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| So we would add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| We want there to be protection of scenic hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| There should be a reasonable basis for defining the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| It should be clear, concise, and understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| And there should be an objective process for reviewing proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| not let's rezone everything to a planned zone and let MPC decide what they can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| The MPC preface, the preface to the plan says that's what they propose to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| to implement this primarily through planned zoning and use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| These are technical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Erosion requires engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| It should require detailed submissions of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| and technical review by professionals in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| And we support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| We're in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| We're in favor of tightening it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| We're in favor of stopping any erosion that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| But we're in favor of doing it in accordance with a clear, concise, legal plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| The plan that MPC prepared has a wealth of information in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| and many good concepts, some of which have been adopted in Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| We don't disagree with a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| What we do disagree with is jumbling it together with background, with here's what's going on in Asheville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| with here are some best practices from other areas, and we pick it up and we read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| And the law says this is legally enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| You must follow this when you make land planning decisions in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| What does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| That's the problem with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| The Chamber and other members of the business community have had people who have been involved in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| from the beginning for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Several of them were on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| They feel they were ignored, and several of them resigned from the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| because they did not feel that MPC was paying attention to their opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| and experience in connection with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| That's fine, but it's not like this was ignored for the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| We also continue to follow the progress of the plan, hoping it would evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| hoping it would be amended to more clearly address some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| And as far as I know, the revisions proposed by Mr. Norman and Mr. Donaldson at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| were the first time we've heard any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| And those revisions are not in a legal posture that you can vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| For you to be able to vote on those, they have to go back to MPC and then come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| So that's the position that we find ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| So since there did not appear to be any progress in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| the chamber has had an advisory committee for months, and it asked the advisory committee to draft a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| The advisory committee consisted of Gary Norvell of Betzenheim, Norvell & Poe Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| Gary has over 40 years or about 40 years of experience as a professional engineer involved in hundreds of developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| and was a member of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| It includes Chris Uten and the Schott Companies, a major property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| a major developer in this county involved in many, many, many projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| and a strong supporter of conservation and protection of hillsides and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| It includes me and our firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| It includes Robin Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| And it includes multiple members of the chamber staff, including Mike Edwards, Garrett Wagley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| and Doug Lawyer, who have degrees in the members of the committee have degrees in forestry, in land planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| as well as lots of experience in regulatory matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| So that's who wrote Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| There's no secret about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| We think Plan B is superior to the MPC plan in many regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| It includes specific standards for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| It includes a process for engineering review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| It includes the same protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| It adds scenic ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| It is tighter than the MPC plan in many regards and actually strengthens the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| We recommend that the county consider requiring permits for any land disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| and get rid of the one-acre exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| We think slopes should be based on three acres, not five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| so we think it should apply to even smaller sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| And there are other areas where it actually tightens up the requirements that were in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| So these were not casually thought of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| What we think MPC did was overreach when it started defining the protected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| When you look at how things have evolved historically, Knoxville has not been destroyed by developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| In fact, Knoxville was founded by developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| I was interested in the reference to land speculators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| If you read the history of Knox County, it says land speculators bought this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| and the first ones laid out the city of Knoxville 225 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| And where did they lay it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| They laid it out on a ridgetop, and the Primo Riverfront lots are on the steepest hillside in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| That's the history of development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| It's hillsides and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| That's what developed first, Black Oak Ridge, Holston Hills, Lions View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| The ridges, the hilltops are what developed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| That's where people wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Downtown is built on a ridgetop over a steep hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| And these areas have not destroyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| When you look at the cover of Plan B, you look at the beautiful hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| and ridgetops that everyone agrees we should protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| They haven't been massively damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| There are no proposals in 225 years to clear these hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| No one is after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| This isn't an effort to destroy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| It's an effort to protect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| We'd like to very quickly go through a few slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| that show you how much MPC proposes to expand the already existing protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| The first slide shows this is what's in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| The general plan for many, many years has identified this as the slopes and ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| if you'll back up to that first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| These are going a little fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Can we get some of the lights cut off on this section up here where that will show up a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| This is what has been included in the general plan for many years as the hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| and slopes in Knox County that needed protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| If you look at that map and you look at this map on the wall that's been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| since this building was built, you'll find the areas are amazingly similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| These are the areas that are generally considered the steepest hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| the most prominent hillsides in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| The next slide shows you these are the highest ridges in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| and including ridges over 1,200 feet north of the Tennessee and French Broad Rivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| and south over 1,100 feet south of the rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| When you're looking at protecting ridges and protecting scenic vistas, a lot of them you can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| You can only see them if they have topographic prominence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| And the next slide shows you how topographic prominence works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| that if you're beside a hill and there are other hills that are lower that are behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| and higher ones behind that, not all of that is visible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| and not all of that needs to be in a special protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| So the next slide shows you what Plan B proposes, which is you take the highest ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| and you take the major arterial roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| And if you can see one of these major or can see one of these ridges over these elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| from a major arterial road, then that ought to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| And the chamber proposes to protect those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| The MPC plan includes no scenic protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| It includes erosion control and grading and so on, but no other protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| The chamber plan does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| The next slide shows you the comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| Well, this is the current general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| And the next slide is the MPC proposed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| So this is the area that MPC now proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| You see how much larger the green area was than it was on the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| The next slide superimposes the old protection area over the new protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| So the new protection area has grown by the amount of the green that you see on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| It has grown to over 39 percent of Knox County suddenly needs special protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| So this is what we say when we say it has become unreasonable in scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| The next slide shows the chamber's proposed hillside protection area under Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| And the next slide shows that compared to the existing general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| it's very similar to what's been recognized for many years as the critical hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| and ridgetop plans, Plan B actually stronger and including a larger area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| Then the next slide compares Plan B and what the MPC plan proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| As you can see, Plan B is less than 10 percent of the county, about 9 percent of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| and the MPC plan is almost 40 percent of the county put in a special protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| This just shows you all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| So what we would urge you to do is to not get caught up in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| but instead to adopt the best plan that provides the best protection that's understandable and legally enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| I'd ask Gary Norvell, who's an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| to quickly review with you the difference in a 15 percent slope and a 20 percent slope and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| so you have a little better example of how development has gone on here for the last 225 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| I'm Gary Norvell with Batson, Hines, Norvell & Poe Engineers in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| and Norvell & Poe Engineers in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| As Tom said, I've had right at 40 years of experience now working in the development community in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| and also the last 12, 13 years in Sevier County dealing with a different kind of terrain up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| In looking at the chamber plan as we went through this, we did, as Tom said, we tried to break out into two phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2629)|
| 0:43:58| the ridge top part and the hillside part because we feel like those are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| They're not one issue in the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| They're two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| The chamber plan is, in the way it is written, is something that can be implemented from an engineering standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2646)|
| 0:44:15| and that's because it's more of an objective plan than a subjective plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| As far as the slopes, 15 to 30 percent is not a slope that's unworkable, and we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2660)|
| 0:44:29| I've seen that in the 40 years almost that I've been doing this and dealing with different slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2669)|
| 0:44:38| We've dealt with 30 percent slopes, 20 to 30 percent slopes the entire time, and those are workable slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2678)|
| 0:44:47| Once you get over 30 percent, and a lot of it depends on the situation that you're in, too, how much of it it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| and how it's located on a particular site as to how you work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| But certainly, there are conditions where maybe something 25 is you've got a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| but you have to look at everything on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| But certainly, a 30 percent number makes more sense than a 15 percent because 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| and if you all can see this thing here that the chamber has that gives you an idea about what those slopes actually look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| I'll let them set that up and go ahead and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| Tom's talked about the areas that we had on the plan, and, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| we feel like that a 30 percent slope is a more important slope at that point than you're getting to position into a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2736)|
| 0:45:45| where you have to be more concerned about erosion set-up control and stormwater measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| This was the first one being 15 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| The middle one is a 30 percent slope, and then this is a 50 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| In regard to the ridge top, as Tom said, we've got in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| we actually do have a defined area that would be designated as through an overlay process as a ridge top for ridge top protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2771)|
| 0:46:24| And it has been decided based on the prominence as far as visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| Go ahead and wrap it up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| I've just got a few more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Ms. Wilson, how much time does he have left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Thirty-six seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Thirty-six seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| The first one is Geddes View, which is an existing --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| All these are existing developments in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| In that particular subdivision, the average slope of the subdivision is 21 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| but there are slopes in it that are up to 39 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| North Shore Town Center, the average slope there is 19 percent, but there's areas of it that are at 29 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2828)|
| 0:47:17| Whittington Creek has areas of a maximum slope of up to 31 percent with a 15 percent average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| Ayers Hall is on a 30 percent slope average with some maximum slopes of 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| Nolwood, which is on Bearden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| I need you to, unless somebody wants to give him some additional time, I'm sorry, sir, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| I'd like to see him finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| If you could go ahead and wrap it up, continue, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Yes, just a few more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| As I said, Nolwood has an average of 16 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| Nobody can argue with the appearance of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| It has a 29 percent maximum slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| The HOPE-4 or HOPE-6 development on Knoxville College, it has an average slope of 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| and that's at a three-and-a-half D dwellings per acre density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| It has maximum slopes of up to 80 percent and one short area up to 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| And, of course, the city-county building where we are now, the maximum slope of it is 22 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| So I think these are examples that are very good to show that working up to 30 percent is a very workable slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| But once you get over that, then you have to start looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Next speaker is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| If you could come to the podium, please, and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| It's 525.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| My name is Lisa Starbuck, and my address is 6229 Babaly Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| I'm here before you today in three different roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| First, as a property owner of about a dozen acres of undeveloped land in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| which would fall inside the hillside and protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| I support the plan, and I do not believe that the hillside plan will devalue my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| But instead, I believe it will enhance the value as well as protect my neighbor's property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2967)|
| 0:49:36| In my role as a member of the task force that developed this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| I'd like you to know that in my professional life, I am a computer consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| And every hour that I spend on civic activities is actual money out of my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| As a citizen who has been asked to serve on several different task forces, including the hillside task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| I have spent hundreds of hours of uncompensated time over the last three years working on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3003)|
| 0:50:12| The task force was very careful to consider all the angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| We had engineers, developers, and many experts, both governmental and non-governmental, to help us work on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3016)|
| 0:50:26| I do not believe that anyone was not heard, and I attended all of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3026)|
| 0:50:34| We also visited other cities and looked at their plans for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| In none of the other cities who implemented this type of plan was there any evidence that the plan devalued any property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| or reduced the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| In fact, it was the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Instead of re-admitting the wheel, we looked at what was working elsewhere and how it could be adapted to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| I am somewhat resentful that a powerful entity such as the chamber did not participate in the many months of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3058)|
| 0:51:06| and dozens of opportunities to make their voices heard until the very last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| They chose instead to derail this process at the very end by throwing rocks, misrepresenting a lot of the things in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3072)|
| 0:51:24| and presenting an alternative plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| I'm not going to address the specifics of their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| I have read it, except to say that it didn't have any input, obviously, from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3092)|
| 0:51:42| other than a small group of people in the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| I think one of the most troubling aspects of it is that it proposes to take away MPC's job of evaluating proposed developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3107)|
| 0:52:01| and put that on the hands of the already overworked engineering departments of both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| And lastly, I'd like to speak as a neighborhood representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| I'm the president of NEPA Neighborhood Organization and the vice president of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| and I'm on the board of several other organizations, all of which are supporting this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| The neighborhoods, as you well know, and a lot of your most contentious issues that come before council and commission are zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3150)|
| 0:52:43| And a lot of times the zoning issues that cause these contentious meetings are oftentimes to do with density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3163)|
| 0:52:54| And so the neighborhoods agreed to offer the developers a carrot in that one of the things that the plan proposed was a density bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3174)|
| 0:53:12| so that if the developer did the right thing, that they would be able to make more money by increasing the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| And so that's a pretty big concession for neighborhoods to make to agree to allow higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| if the developer can show that they're developing the property in such a way that it won't negatively impact everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3207)|
| 0:53:34| And, you know, I really, in that same spirit, I don't see anybody on the other side doing that same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3214)|
| 0:53:43| Anyway, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| We don't have anyone else signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Commissioner Broyles, is that your light or your daughter's light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| Actually, it was my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| I had a question for the gentleman from the chamber who were here, and I had turned my light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| and didn't get recognized and left it on in the hope that somebody would see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| So is it okay for me to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Now is the time for questions, comments by the commissioners and the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| As for the chamber's plan, I still, you know, I've read through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3262)|
| 0:54:33| but it's going to be impossible for me to give it any serious consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| until I know exactly who worked on it and what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| You gave me a few names and then said, and, you know, a group of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| So I can't tell by that how diverse the group was, who they represented, or what their interests are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| So I would really prefer to have you all send us a list of exactly who worked on this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| and exactly what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| As to how Knoxville and Knox County developed a couple hundred years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| of course it developed on the ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| But today we don't have to be quite as concerned about an indigenous tribe coming to take our scalps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3323)|
| 0:55:33| I don't think that, you know, anyone, these towns were frontier towns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| and anybody who knows anything about military tactics knows you get there first with the most men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| and you get the highest grant you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| And that was how a lot of these frontier towns were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| But that's not what's going on now a couple hundred years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| We have different priorities than they did then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| And I understand that you all have had a little fun poked at you this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| because of the name of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| I'm guessing that you all didn't realize that Plan B was the name of an emergency contraceptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| But I know that that has also been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| We weren't fully aware that we considered this an emergency contraceptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3373)|
| 0:56:23| I suggest that you might want to do a little research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| because I know you got some fun poked at you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| So I am delighted to know that you all realized what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| But honestly, I don't see how any of us can give this any serious consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| unless we do know exactly who worked on it, exactly where it came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| and what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| And if you don't have time right now to go down the whole list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| then you can certainly just e-mail that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| But I can't give this any serious consideration without answers to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3415)|
| 0:57:04| We will be happy to e-mail that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| I did list everyone who was directly involved in the drafting of the plan in my earlier remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| which was Chris Uten of the Schott Company, Gary Norvell of Batson, Himes, Norvell, and Poe, me, Tom McAdams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| Bernstein, Stair, McAdams, attorneys at law, Robin Askew, who is an attorney at law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| and then from the chamber staff, Mike Edwards, Garrett Wagley, Laddie Fields, and Doug Lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| And what concerns me about that is that I'm not seeing a lot of diversity in that group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| in terms of different outlooks on how we should be treating our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| So that's another major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| I think one point about that legally is that Plan B is before you in a manner that you can revise it, you can add to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3474)|
| 0:58:05| you can subtract from it if there are provisions you think should be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| You legally can do that, include it in the plan, and adopt it and send it to MPC for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| You cannot do that with the MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| It can only be voted up or down in its current posture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| You can certainly send it back to MPC with requests for revisions, or you can adopt your own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| But with Plan B, you're free to revise it in accordance with comments that you've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| in accordance with any comments MPC might make or anything else of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotection?start=3520)|
