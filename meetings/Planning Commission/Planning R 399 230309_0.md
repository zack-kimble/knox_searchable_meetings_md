| 0:11:04| One point of clarification I think we need to fix on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Item number five is listed as Central Baptist Church of Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| However, the case file is East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=671)|
| 0:11:28| Did you say five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| When I click on it on the agenda, it takes me to East Tennessee Children's Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| closure of South 21st Street due to safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=695)|

| 0:11:46| the Central Church, the Central Baptist Church of Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| I want to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Anderson Road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=711)|

| 0:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| That's just the PDF file, not the actual website, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| The website's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| The PDF file has the wrong link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| I'm on the website right now, and when I click it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| it takes me to the case file for East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| That's why I want to make sure number five is truly Central Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| Does everybody have access to the Central Baptist Bearden case file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=735)|

| 0:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Just want to make sure that that was noted of what's different on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=761)|

| 0:14:06| Ms. Hillman, would you like to give us some background on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=850)|

| 0:14:23| So pursuant to the requirements of that city charter, staff has completed the 2023 annual update of the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| There were two public meetings held and two press releases about various drafts or proposed revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| I'm happy to answer any questions about those revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=879)|

| 0:15:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=908)|

| 0:15:30| Applicant, Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Location, south side of Washington Pike, southwest of Millartown Pike, 2.19 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| Present zoning, RN1, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Zoning requested, RN2, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| Existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Staff recommendation is to approve RN2 and hillside protection zoning because it is located on an arterial near a commercial node and is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=951)|
| 0:16:04| And I see the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| My name is Victor Jernigan, 229 Sherway Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| And I do believe there's at least one person here to speak in opposition, and I would certainly like to hear from them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| So do we have someone here in opposition that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=981)|
| 0:16:45| I think I did that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| I'm Allison Fay, and I'm with Allison Fay Properties, and I'm here today representing the Robert Apple Estate, which is also on the proposed area of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1012)|
| 0:17:07| Mr. Apple's estate owns the property at 4604 and 4602 Washington Pike, and it composes approximately 10 acres of pristine land that he bought over 32 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1027)|
| 0:17:24| If anybody's been down there, you'll see he's got a very fine home, a very large estate property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| It's well maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| He has been a good neighbor, a good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| He owns a local business here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| And at this time, the estate is very concerned about the valuation of their property with regards to the proposed development being established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1057)|
| 0:17:48| and they're in the opinion that this new development would decrease the value of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| And one of the largest landowners in the area, and has a very large home on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| the estate is very concerned about what's going to go on and what the value of their property is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| So that's why they're opposed at this time, and they haven't seen anything that would help their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| more so because of the now density that's going to be coming to the property in addition to the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| They're just very concerned about the valuation of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| That's what I'm here to oppose until we can figure out something that might help their valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Fay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1112)|
| 0:18:45| I'm simply asking for the approval of the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| I do want to speak to Ms. Fay's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| I got her comments late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| She was nice enough to meet with me on the property yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Their property is park-like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| There's a letter included in the package that I send out to adjoining property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| informing them of what I'm going to be doing and what's going to be going on in the zoning and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| and they're responding to the letter that I had sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| That letter is, I believe, a good demonstration of the fact that we'll keep all the neighbors informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| as we go forward with site plans, as we go forward with the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| and we'll definitely keep the Apple Estate involved in what we're doing as we continue to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Please support the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| I'll sit to commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Vice Chair Uden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| I would like to make a motion that we approve her staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| We have a motion by Vice Chair Uden to approve her staff recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| Seeing no likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| I apologize for my late arrival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| The only comment I wanted to make on this item is that – can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Is that this property is in a C of R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| And the size, you know, when the zoning ordinance was redone, decisions were made about R and 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| and R and 2 versus the size of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| This property clearly should be an R and 1 based on the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| You know, duplex, I don't know exactly what Mr. Jernigan is planning on doing with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| but if he is planning on doing a duplex, that is a use on review both in R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| I just feel like I'm going to have to vote against this just because of the size of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| really dictates to be an R and 1 as opposed to an R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1267)|

| 0:21:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| We have one opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Next agenda item is number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Applicant Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Location, southeast side of Washington Pike, southwest of Millartown Pike, 3.87 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| Present zoning, R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Hillside protection, zoning request, R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1295)|

| 0:21:42| R and 1, hillside protection, zoning request, R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Existing land use, R and 4 and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| Existing land use, rural residential, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Staff recommendation, approve R and 4 and hillside protection zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| because it is located on an arterial near a commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| and is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| We have the applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| My name is, again, Victor Jernigan, 229 Sherway Road, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| I'm very much appreciative of the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| and I'm asking you to support the staff recommendation with a positive vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Seeing no opposition, would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| These two properties are being designed to go together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| to directly address Ms. Midas' point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| The piece that's being requested as an R2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| is about two and a half, almost three acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| and we'll be entering from Millertown just at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| and all of the traffic will come in and we'll tie in the R and 2 property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| which will then become a buffer to the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| Since it's my property, I'm not trying to get a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| this piece is medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| and it was a step down to the R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| which would match with what the rest of the neighborhood would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| and those will all be on 10,000, 12,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| acceptable for an R2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| and we certainly will be bringing plans forward for approval in the R2 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| as we have on another agenda item later in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| I'd like to make a motion we approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| We have a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| seconded by Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| We're on to agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| The applicant, Dowell Springs Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Location, northern terminus of Dowell Springs Boulevard, 12.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| Present zoning, OP and HP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| Zoning requested, RN5 and HP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| Staff recommendation is to approve RN5 and Hillside Protection Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| because it is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| and provides a transition of land use intensities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1479)|
| 0:24:49| Jerry Bodie, 7213 West Hampton Place, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you, Mr. Bodie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| Would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Bodie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1502)|
| 0:25:14| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| I'm here on behalf of Covenant Health, Peninsula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| the Thompson Proton Center, East Tennessee Behavioral Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Ortho Tennessee, Knoxville Orthopedic Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| and Gastrointestinal Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Most of you, I believe, were on planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| I think last summer when this same property came through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| on the sector plan amendment and my clients were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| and speaking in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| The basis of their opposition is they're medical providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| and they all have medical facilities in this Dow Springs Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| When the Dow Springs Medical Park was under concept for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| they were approached by the developers about moving their facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| and developing new facilities in this Dow Springs Medical Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| with the understanding that it would remain a medical park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| and not have any residential component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| As an inducement to invest and locate their facilities here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| their understanding is that it would always remain limited to a medical park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| it would cater to a medical park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| and the traffic and people served would be for medical-based needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| Their position that a multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| isn't in harmony with the existing use of this complex and these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| and they submit that it will have a negative impact on their investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| on their use of the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| and again this being a medical park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| and introducing residential pedestrian-type traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| On behalf of my clients, I'd ask that you deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Well, I will say that from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| from when the first piece of property was sold in Dow Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| there's always been RN-5 zoning in the 10 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| that you see at the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| That 10 acres is a part of this 22-acre tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| and we're asking that the balance of that be zoned RN-5 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Dow Springs was not initially designed as just a medical park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| We had retail zoning in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| In fact, where the Proton Center sits now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| was zoned for a neighborhood shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| The Proton Center developer bought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| before we could sell it to a neighborhood shopping center developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| In addition, we still have retail zoning at the front entrance to Dow Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| So I'm not sure where someone was assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| that this would always be just medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| We have attorneys in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| We have financial planners in the condo development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| We have the FBI, who is certainly not medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| So we would respectfully ask the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| to approve the staff's recommendation of RN-5 for this tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| Thank you, Mr. Bode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| And, Taylor, I'm going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| you made the statement that the people who moved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| there was an understanding, an agreement, a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Is there anything in writing that anybody has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| or is this just a he said, she said agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| There are covenants that do exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| and those covenants originally did exclude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| this type of residential type use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Those covenants, my understanding is that there's an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| that has taken place within the past few months to those covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| Do you have one of the covenants with you that shows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| Well, I think he said that they revised it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| that it would permit the multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Is that what I'm understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| In talking with my client, there is some potential opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| to those amended covenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| or the actual amendment of those covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| I guess what I'm trying to get at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| when they pick a medical office that went in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| was there anything in any of their documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| that said that by them moving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| that all of that area would stay medical office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| as has been stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Well, this type of use was specifically prohibited in the covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1780)|
| 0:29:50| But for clarity, they've been amended to allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Okay, that's where I'm trying to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Yeah, I guess a question for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| I would think that having a residential component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| with that large of an employment base right there would be a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| I guess I'm having trouble understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| why you think it's a detriment to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| In speaking with my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| the concerns, I think, center on the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| the type of traffic that's been utilizing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| for the past, I believe, 20-plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| has been not only doctors and staff coming and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| but the patients coming and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| different traffic patterns, traffic flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| and I think mainly traffic-type issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| and concerns from a commercial-type park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| to introducing a residential component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| and the potential of, I guess, in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| traffic jams and just traffic circulation in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| I would think that a residential during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| would be very limited traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| and then probably pretty much concentrated in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| and late afternoon, evening, early evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| I'm going to make a motion to approve the RN-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| General Residential Neighborhood and HP Healthside Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| Somebody's going to have to help me on a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| So we had a motion to approve for staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| We still have a light on here, Vice Chair Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| Mr. Phillips took care of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| We've got one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Commissioner Rolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1919)|
| 0:32:10| On to item 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| applicant Victor Jernigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| location southwest side of Haywood Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| west of Eaker Street, 1.22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| Zoning is RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| existing land use, agriculture, forestry, vacant land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Proposed use, four duplexes on individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| Staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| approve the request for four duplexes on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| in the RN-2 zoning district, subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Yes, I'm sure there's, I think there's at least two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| If they will, I'll let them go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| and speak about their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| My name is David Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| I live at 346 East Media Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| I signed up online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| So I'm assuming I don't need to sign this piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I do have a question before I proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| because this document that's submitted states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| that there's going to be eight units, four duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| but the site plan shows seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Am I reading the site plan wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| There will eventually, we believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| to be four duplexes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| The property on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| has a single-family house right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| because we're still looking at how that could be designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| That property adjoins a vacant lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| and a single-family house on the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| and we anticipate that it will be a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| We just don't have that specific duplex designed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2034)|
| 0:34:03| Looking at the faces on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| I'm going to assume most of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| did not travel on Sevierville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| before it was redesigned for the James White Parkway project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| And so if you came from Sevierville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| and was coming into town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| it actually turned into Haywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| then it dropped into Davenport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| You can go up over the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| hit Gay Street, be on your merry way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| Same thing for the traffic coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| What has happened now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| since the city has ripped out Coxwell Street access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| and Dogwood exists over on East Moody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| on the other side of the parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| a lot of the afternoon traffic now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| is having to rely on Haywood again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| like it did years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| because Moody ends up being at a standstill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| for the parents lining up to make it up onto Tipton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| to get their children from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| If you put four duplexes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| which I'm sure Mr. Jernigan will say otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| but they will end up being marketed to college students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| as best as I can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| the driveway width is somewhere between 12 and 18 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| You're going to end up with a total of 21 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| living in those houses, at least, at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| There's no place for that parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| which means they're going to be on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| which means all the parents and the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| that are currently utilizing Haywood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| and the community itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| are going to be negatively impacted by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| because they're going to park on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| There's nowhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| And the way that's designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| you'll be lucky to get any of them into that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| So that alone is my biggest problem with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| The watershed, as I think you've reviewed my written comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| when I disassembled this approval recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| the watershed off of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| is going to negatively impact that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| In fact, it's probably going to flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| It already floods at the bottom of Haywood right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| because of the way they redesigned that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| So when you start having that watershed off those driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| the topo of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| will force that water out the front, down that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| and Haywood will end up being impassable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| So that's the reason why I'm in opposition to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you, Mr. Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Mr. Jernigan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| I very much appreciate the concerns of the neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| in relationship to how this is being designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| I had originally looked quite seriously at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| If you look at the overall aerial map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| it sits in sort of a unique position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| backed up to the on-ramp to James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| and less than 150 feet off of Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| And there's the small house that I was mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| right there with the vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| So what we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| instead of looking at rezoning the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| to put more density on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| we were able to look at what's happening in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| respond to the market conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| that we've seen similar type of product do extremely well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| right on Sevier Avenue and just off of Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| So we're making the effort to design something here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| that will be really attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| to the people that are coming into the Knoxville market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| One big change that wasn't mentioned in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| is the fact that the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| just accepted $1 million from the Bloomberg Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| to extend the Greenway bike trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| from the urban wilderness down Cottrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| It's called the Cottrell Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| and it'll connect all of these properties to Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| So it'll be an unbelievable walking and biking connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| and these properties will easily...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| We think most of the people on these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| will be riding bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| and using the walking and Greenway trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| as much as they do a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| We have considered the drive situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| The properties have garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| and the driveways themselves will be able to store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| at least three additional cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| maybe four, with the ability to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| We have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| We are in the process now of filing a new plat for the lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| which also gets back to the issue of that single house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| We're widening the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| They were originally 50-foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| but because I own them all, we're making them 60-foot lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| so that we can increase the landscaping buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| between the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| because we're confident that the people who live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| appreciate the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| and it gives us more flexibility on the drive lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| and how we're going to manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I am confident the engineers that are going to work on the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| will have all of the stormwater issues identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| as the project continues to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| but I do ask you to support strongly the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| for the duplexes on the RN2 property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| I'm really glad that the applicant brought up the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| about what's about to happen to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| When I first looked at this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| I was thinking about what it is right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| and started to have some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| that the opposition was expressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| and then looked at the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| and thought about exactly where that's positioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| and how extremely beautiful that location is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| If I was a student and got to live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| I would feel like a lucky duck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| because that is going to be a pedestrian and cycling mecca,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| and I think that what we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| with this type of application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| is a transition from what we have historically seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| of an apartment or a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| and some of the traffic concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| and the car concerns that we would normally have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| The persons who are going to want to live in this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| are going to want to use their feet and their bikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| so I think for that reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| and seeing how that is going to provide a transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| between the Greenway and the current neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| I would like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| to support staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| to approve this with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| All right, we have a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| for staff recommendation by Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| We still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Let's go on to Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Yeah, I just want to echo Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Really, I see this as more of what we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| in the city is the missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| that we've heard a lot about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| We jump from a lot of single-family detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| directly into multifamily apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| and there's not a whole lot in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| so I think this is an excellent opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| Sir, we've already voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2483)|
| 0:41:32| Agenda item 21, applicant Jonathan Layman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Location, northeast corner of Beaver Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| and Oak Ridge Highway, east of Shod Road, .63 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| Present zoning, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Zoning requested, RB, general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| Staff recommendation is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2516)|

| 0:42:51| so it's not actually big enough to actually do anything more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2571)|

| 0:45:05| the reason that I had proposed five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| is because, you know, that's pretty consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| with new development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| And I don't want to build an additional structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| on the property at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| If I'm understanding correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| I would have to subdivide in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| What I have is a, I have a duplex currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| and it is approximately 4,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| It is a, it's a two-bedroom, one-bath upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| and then downstairs is a basement that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| it's pretty much finished so that it could easily be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| two one-bedroom apartments downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| So with very little modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| and no, you know, no addition to the footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| I could have four units there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| and offer more affordable housing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| that seems to be quite in demand in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| And so that's what I was proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| I have 1.93 acres, and I was, I was wanting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| I don't know if that's an exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| to be able to have four units in that one building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| but that's, that's what I wanted to do at this time, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2782)|

| 0:46:46| That would be considered multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| which is not permitted in RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2808)|

| 0:47:13| through use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2833)|

| 0:49:40| been zero construction on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| There was basically very little development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| shared with the public about what was planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| under the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| And again, with this zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| there's basically an idea from the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| that a medical or a light office or even a residential complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| would be complementary to this part of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| with very little idea of what constitutes a building that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| going to go on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| So I'm here basically just in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| for a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| There's a condition in the request that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| the request cannot adversely affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| any other part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| But as we've talked about Dowell Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| and that area of the county as an emerging medical zone, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| I don't really hear is, would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| more complementary for that type of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| to be located in that particular part of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| rather than in the residential area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| So I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| The other thing is, there is a landscaping request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| that's part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| And I'd like to make a request for a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| to the landscape request that's included in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| If, in fact, this were to become a business and a zone there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| there's a comment in the request that existing pine trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| or evergreens might satisfy the barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| between the residential area that's behind that lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| and what's developed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I've submitted some photographs through the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| for this particular request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| I also have photographs here, if anybody would wish to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| My comment is basically that the state of the evergreens there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| they're either absent and don't provide the barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| or they're aging, they're diseased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| And actually, the furs on the evergreen are so high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| basically, there is no barrier down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| at eyesight level between the residential housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| and what would be developed in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| So I'm actually requesting an amendment to the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| to include a specific request for the evergreen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| or the landscaping to mandate a wall on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| of that development area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| I think we have a Miss Samantha Bruce that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| Is Miss Bruce present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| She's saying it's for item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Okay. Excuse me. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| I'm getting ahead of myself here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Mr. Fulgham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| I think we're completely in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| of the staff's recommendation of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| and the conditions that they've laid out were acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| All of those are acceptable also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| I know one of the things is a landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| a class A landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| So, you know, we're okay with that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Ms. Sher Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| I think all the conditions that have been suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| to try and minimize the impact are great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| but I don't think I'm going to be able to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| and I just wanted to express why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| As I look at the overall map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I see the commercial on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| and the commercial on another side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| and the small patch of residential still existing between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| and the planned residential sort of fills that spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| and protects all the residential that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| and the OB move opens up the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| for a commercial component that I think could be detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| to those existing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| So I think for those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| I'm not going to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| but understand that some of the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| to help with buffering are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I understand the concern in relationship to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| I think that this having only direct access off of Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| may influence that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| I wanted to ask the county engineering a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| about the buffer, just given the neighbor's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| With the requirement of the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| would there be some, I guess, site review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| existing conditions review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| to see if the trees that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| satisfy the buffer requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Yes, we would consider existing vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| If it met the requirement, if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| they would have to put in the Class A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| as specified in the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| And so with the photographs that were attached to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| I understand what he's referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| with being able to see through at eye level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| Is that something that would be considered in the Type B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| the height at which the visibility is happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| Yes, I would think the intent would be to block the view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| and if they're that high and you can still see through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| then I wouldn't think that vegetation would meet the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| This is probably a question for staff, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| and a point of clarification from what Mr. Fulgham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| everybody was talking about a Class A buffer, I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Staff is calling for a Class B landscape buffer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| Can the staff speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| That's accurate. It's called Type B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Yeah, okay, so Type B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Type B landscape buffer versus Type A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| That being said, I mean, I'm very familiar with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| It is in the sector plan as office and OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| I think it's probably a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| I know there's civic and institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| There's a large church on about 10 acres just a few feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| On one side and on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| there's anything from storage to multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| Up and down through there, it's a divided highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| I think it's a good opportunity for infield development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| So with that, I'd like to make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| All right, we've got a motion to approve for staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| by Commissioner Huber, seconded by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| Seeing no other likes, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3352)|

| 0:56:56| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| I hear a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3423)|
| 0:57:12| Ms. Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Samantha Bruce, 6326 Stevens Quarry Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| and I'm here speaking on behalf of the rest of the residents of Stevens Quarry Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| Ms. Michelle's plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| her business plan is great, but it's in the wrong location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| and that's kind of where we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| The current infrastructure cannot support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| and there is no way to reasonably get the infrastructure that is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| We are all on well back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| It is very, even though we have a high water table, very, very few park sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Like on my property personally, I have one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| If that park site dries up, I have no water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| Like my well's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| I have no other place to put a well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| My neighbor, her well's already gone dry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| but luckily another place on her property has already parked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| so she's in the process of putting in another well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| It's just the infrastructure is just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| So while it is a great business plan, it is the wrong location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| and that is where we are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| It is a single lane country road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| There's a rock quarry on one side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| There is a drop off on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Every day, there's nine families back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| and we have to go mirror to mirror to get in and out of our street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| and now we're trying to put a business back there with increased traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| and there's just no way to widen the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| There's no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Three families have kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| I have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Another family has six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Another family has seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| So there's literally 20 kids on this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| There is no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| My kids' bus stop is at the top of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| We're going to have to have my kids walk up this street with no sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| and an increased amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| And if you look at some of the data we have, on a heavy rainstorm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| the road floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| It floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| It's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| And if you look at some of the other pictures, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| it is a rock quarry on one side and a drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| No, there's no shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| There is no place to put to widen the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| There is no way to put in a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| And there is no reasonable way to get the infrastructure back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| We would have to have city water in order to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| and there's no way to get city water back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| because you would literally have to go through a rock quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| I mean, we're talking about millions and millions and millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| worth of taxpayer money to get the city infrastructure back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| We have issues with our Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| We have issues with our power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| We have issues with our water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Like, there's no – we're on satellite Internet back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| We have no high-speed Internet, and we are 860 –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| my house is 868 feet from Washington Pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| which is where high-speed Internet is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| You have to be within 600 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| So the only way is to run Internet to a junction box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| which is across a road, and even with the right conduit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| any time someone runs over the road, Internet's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| It's out for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| So we have no Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| It's a huge thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| It's a threat to our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| It's a threat to the kids, and it's a threat to our way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| The amount of noise and the amount of traffic that this business plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| could pose to our very quiet and quaint neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| is where our concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| I mean, it's a great business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| I mean, it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Agricultural tourism is a thing that this community needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| and rural preservation to stop subdivisions from coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| and eating farmland is something we need, just not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| just not this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3655)|
| 1:01:06| If it's okay, may I have Adam Thompson speak on my behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| I'd register on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| It's Adam Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| It's 6726 Little Platte Creek Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| And a little introduction about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| I'm a seventh-generation farmer in Coryton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| If you look at Stevens Quarry Road, directly across the street is our farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| We've got about a mile and a half road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Seventh-generation on that farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Pretty proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| When I was a kid, we were a dairy farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| And, obviously, times changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Farms change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| We have to adapt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| And so we went from dairy production to beef.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| We now sell beef direct-to-consumer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| But, you know, my history with this piece of property here is I remember when I was a kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| before any of the houses were there, it was a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| I was all over that farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| And that little road has been that same little road ever since before I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| And so, anyway, some things never change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| But the instance here, the reason I got involved was because, obviously, I'm passionate about agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3740)|
| 1:02:32| But what bothered me in the opposition and, obviously, relationships in small communities matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| With our neighbors, without good neighbors, well, life's not very smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| So we like having good relationships with neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| The problem that I see in this situation is the opposition, unlike myself and my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| the applicant, Michelle, and other full-time farmers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| is the opposition is doing their protesting while living on land that they don't require to sustain their livelihoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| And so how I got involved in this initially was I was basically just a third party on a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3788)|
| 1:03:15| because I'm not a stranger to this part of the process, but I'd never been through the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| I wanted to see what the meeting was like between the applicant and staff and engineering and codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| And so I basically went on as a fly on the wall, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| It was interesting because engineering and codes and staff had this idea, oh, my gosh, what are you wanting to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| Because there was a complaint filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| And so what do you want me to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Well, they had this grandiose idea of what she was doing versus what she was actually proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| which was initially two covered wagons, which you could do camping in, glamping, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| And so codes and engineering was concerned, are these stationary objects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| Are they actually homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| The wheels are accessories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| No, they're actually movable wagons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| And so when engineering and codes said, oh, this is actually a wagon, it's literally a wagon that you can move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3842)|
| 1:04:09| then there were a lot of things that went to the wayside and weren't an issue anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| Staff had concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Well, okay, it's an overnight camping thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| Does it fit in ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| Does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| And so we had to review, you know, what do we do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| It's an interesting scenario that typically we've not seen in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| And then I think it was Mike Reynolds or Liz Albertson that made the comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| we have this zoning over here that's rural preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| I think it would be perfect for what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| And so they were the ones that mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| I think Liz pulled it up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| Everyone in the room, we read through it, and we're like, wow, this fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| And it fits perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| This is exactly what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| And so there seemed to be an excitement in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Okay, we've just solved the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| And it's also going to be the first one in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| We've had this zoning for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| It was designed for this purpose, but nobody knew what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| And most ag farmers are not down zoning because they're just doing what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| It gives the owner, the landowner, the farmer opportunities to seek more sources of income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3912)|
| 1:05:21| using their farmland and using the livestock and their crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| And I've been doing this long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| I've seen a lot of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| And we all know that each zoning has its permissions and its restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| In ag, you can have your livestock, you can have your crops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| but you cannot develop more than one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| It's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| And you also can't run a commercial business out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| In planned residential, well, you can have your houses, whatever density is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| but you have to get rid of the cow in the backyard, and you still can't run a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| On commercial, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| You can have your business, but you can't live there, and you still can't have your cow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Rural preservation goes the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| So the restriction there is now we're going from one dwelling unit per acre to one dwelling unit per 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| So the owner, the landowner, the farmer accepts that restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| but it gives them the latitude to explore their options within the agricultural realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| to diversify their farm to keep that farm profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| Because at the end of the day, every farm is a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| If that business is not profitable, the farm is not a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| Mr. Thompson, if you'd wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Okay, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| If that farm goes out of business, that farm now grows houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| And I'm pretty sure that everyone in the community would prefer to have a farm than their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| So I certainly appreciate your time, and thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Commissioner Schell-Sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| Fifteen, the dwellings, so it's one dwelling per 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| And how big is this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| Forty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| Forty-six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| I just needed to clarify that, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| So I think that what the applicant's representative said has a lot of weight to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| and I see a lot of value in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| One thing that concerns me that stood out when the opposition was speaking was the road accessing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4057)|
| 1:07:47| And, you know, I think that this is a potentially very good use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| but I also think that there's a lot of, not this specific use, but just in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| this zoning could allow for potential uses that would have a lot of traffic coming down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| And looking at the street view, it is a very, very narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| And, you know, I've been to overnight stays that are in very rural areas before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| and, you know, being an outsider, you end up going way faster than you should around roads like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| just because you're not used to it and you've got a destination in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| So I do foresee, like, some potential issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| And so I wanted to ask, engineering again, another question, you know, regarding to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| if they were to, the concerns, if there are kids going to a bus to go to school, that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4120)|
| 1:08:49| If they were to do, like, a corn maze or something like that where, you know, there's a lot of traffic coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4129)|
| 1:08:59| would there be any requirements to, or would the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| does the county have any plans to change this road size or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| We don't, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| That was one of our concerns when we first heard this was the use of commercial, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| use there adjacent to the narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| But based on my understanding, there are going to be, like, I think they're going to have two wagons there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| So we kind of looked at it as, like, well, if they were adding two single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| what would be our opinion of that with that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| And we felt like based on that use with that potential generated traffic, although the road is narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| with that small, I guess, increase of traffic, we were okay at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| Now, obviously, if it gets, you know, more than that, then we might have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| But we don't feel like that they've reached a tipping point at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| And for planning staff, is there any way to control the number of units on this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4187)|
| 1:09:59| So there's the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| That's part of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| There's also, so agritourism is permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| It does not explicitly describe overnight accommodations in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| Two permitted uses on review are rural retreat and bed-and-breakfast style lodging facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4214)|
| 1:10:22| So I would think that if overnight accommodations exceeding two were to be proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| that that would go through some sort of additional review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| That seems to be the intent, but I'll defer to Mr. Elliott on his interpretation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| When we met with the applicant, under the uses permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| such as recreational uses such as horseback riding, biking, walking trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| and other uses which do not require new construction structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| we deemed that camping would fit underneath that recreational use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| because the wagons they're bringing in are portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| They can hook them to a truck, pull them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| They're not permanent structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| So we deemed that the camping would fit under that recreational use, which is a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| Okay, so a new construction building for overnight accommodation would require a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4270)|
| 1:11:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| If they were to build a permanent structure, a bed-and-breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| it would require a use on review and come back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| And then other forms of agritourism, and I was looking at the definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4289)|
| 1:11:38| or the uses allowed here, would something like a corn maze, pumpkin patch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4298)|
| 1:11:47| that kind of seasonal thing be allowed here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| I would say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| I think that would be a recreational use, so I would think yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| And would that be allowed under the current zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| Under the ag zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| I think that would be a commercial enterprise that wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| It's not codified in the ag zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| I do think, though, if they were to do a corn maze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| it would require them to get a transient vendor or temporary use permit through our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4337)|
| 1:12:25| and I think if that were to be the case, we would address the traffic concerns at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| Okay, that's very good to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| because the idea of being able to make a living off your land is a very old idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4353)|
| 1:12:42| and I fully support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| I think that there's good reason to allow this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| and I think that the use of what they've discussed is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| but, of course, my concerns are in the neighbor and the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| I'll let someone else comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| All right, Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| I applaud the efforts of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| I do think this is a very creative way to generate income on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| I think the elephant in the room that I'm trying to understand is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| let's say this business plan is very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| How many covered wagons could be on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4415)|
| 1:13:44| I mean, is there a limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| I mean, could there be 100 covered wagons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| I don't think I want to do that much laundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| I understand, but is there a limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| I don't think if it did get successful that any more than five ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| and that may not even be that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| and they're all in an area that is not surrounding where really any of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| It's way in the back, so it's quite covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| I mean, it's just out in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| It's quite peaceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| I think as long as that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| I think it would be perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I can certainly see, after this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| people who have agricultural land doing this down zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| and trying to put a lot of covered wagons on a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| No, I still have horses to feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| I was going to say something to that, and that slipped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Oh, and as far as the corn maze and the pumpkin patches, I can't grow corn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| I don't even have a green thumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| So that's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| I just wanted to commend you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| I'm a second-generation farmer who had to find a second way to support their farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| and I think that this is a great idea that's outside of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| So I wanted to commend you for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| and to the opposition, also on a well and a septic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| so I completely understand where you're coming from and a skinny road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| So I was going to ask engineering the same thing that Commissioner over here had said too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4529)|
| 1:15:36| so I get the fact that it's not in the works right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| But with a covered wagon, it's not going to tap into the well nor the septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| I understand it's going to be extra people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| but it won't be extra people 365 days a year for two homes, if that makes any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| So hopefully, you know, with two, it will be able to support, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| her students that are riding there and, you know, the few people that are going to come and stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| Well, and to come back to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Mr. Thompson and Liz Green owns the majority of that long stretch there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| where the kids can be walking up to Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| And there's 10 feet there that's flat that is always groomed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| and they can walk on that for safety, and a lot of them do jog off the side of the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4580)|
| 1:16:29| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| I didn't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| I had to – my husband's disabled, so I had to quit my regular job and figure out how to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| Horses are expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Last chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| One more intensity of use question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| In the agricultural zone, am I correct in that you can apply for a duplex in the ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| or is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| So somebody made a comment about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| I'm not going to give Mr. Higgins any credit for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| but somebody made a comment about intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| and that's the only thing I wanted to kind of get back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| Somebody talked about growing houses or doing other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| and I would suspect that a duplex out there on all that acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| probably wouldn't be that big of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| So I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| What would we call the wagon from a permitting perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| Like if we wanted to attach a condition to this, say a limit of five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| what would you call it, a temporary overnight structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| Yes, I would say that, or a campsite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| Campsite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| I'd like to go ahead and make a motion to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| per staff recommendation with the additional condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| of no more than five campsites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| I thought the limitation was based upon the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| That's for a permanent structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| But can we actually legally do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Can I make a comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Yes, you may, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| The request before us is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| This is not a use-only view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| So we need to look at whether it's proper to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| a rural preservation zone or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| not whether it's wagons or pop-up tents or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| So we're just dealing with the actual rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| The use is really not relevant at this point, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| If you made a motion to approve rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| The motion is to approve the rezone request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| with a limit on campsites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I don't think I'll relate to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| but I don't think we can put conditions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| This is the zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| So at this point, it would be appropriate to vote it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| But those conditions, I don't think they're premature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| at this time, Commissioner Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| If campsites fall under a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| are we not allowed to attach conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| to rezone requests in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| I thought that we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| No, because the code would apply whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| what's permitted in that district would apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| based on the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| I was thinking the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| Are we not able to add conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| to rezonings in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| I thought what the county could add conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| but I need to defer to some county codes in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| Yeah, I would caution to condition related to the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| Now, you can condition related to dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| or buffers, but it gets into what's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| conditional zoning, which is not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| Can I ask for clarity then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Because the staff report specifically says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| conditions can be placed on an approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| to address any potential impacts to other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4821)|
| 1:20:32| That was specific to considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| a bed and breakfast lodging facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| saying that that would go through a use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| the purpose of which is to ensure it's in harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| with the surrounding area and long-range plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4851)|
| 1:20:59| Commissioner Stelzow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| Lynn failed, so there's no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| I'll make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| RP rule preservation per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| I didn't get the second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| We have a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| based on staff recommendation by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| seconded by Commissioner Barger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| and we still have lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| so I'm going to move on here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Commissioner Adams has turned her light off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| so I'll go to Commissioner Phillips to turn his light off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| so we'll go to Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| One thing that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| the thought has crossed my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| to address opposition for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Under AG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| they could have one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| and there's 46 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| so you could potentially have 46 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| built there by right, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| And I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| Well, obviously, it would have to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| Engineering would have a say in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| but by the zone, they're allowed one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| Under this, it's different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| and I think the impact would be a lot less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| than if you turned around and developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| a 46-unit housing development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| so I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| I really do. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Seeing no other lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| we have a motion to approve for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Agenda item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| Wilkinson subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Applicant, Rick Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Location, east side of Nubbin Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| northeast of Penrose Terrace Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| Approximate acreage...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| About a fifth of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| 8,717 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| Zoning, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Existing land use, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Proposed use, detached residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| Number of lots, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| This will require two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| Staff recommendation is to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| Looks like potentially three motions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| First motion, recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| deny variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| to reduce the minimum site distance for new lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| because it will create an unsafe condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| as recommended by Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| Motion two recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| deny the request to remove condition number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| from the concept plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| 10-SB-14-C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| because the site does not have safe access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| to Nubbin Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| Motion three recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| deny the request for one detached dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| and reduction of the 35-foot peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| to 30 feet along the Nubbin Ridge Road frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| and to 15 feet for the rear setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| based on the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| to deny the minimum site distance variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| with the associated concept plan 3-SC-23-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Yes, and I'm Melanie Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I'm the attorney for the applicant, Rick Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| My address is 217 East Broadway in Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| and I believe there is some opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| so we'd like to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| My name is Angela Dunaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| My address is 1304 Feather Rose Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| I'm not sure why we're here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| as this property has been deemed unbuildable since 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| has been noted as unbuildable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| in every iteration of the subdivision plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| provided to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| It was required to be part of Penrose Terrace subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| as noted by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| since the lot is less than five acres in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| and should have been designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| as a common area of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| The property, while included in all revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| provided to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| was not included in the final subdivision plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| begging the question, was this intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| thereby creating a lot that was illegally subdivided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| In fact, Mr. Wilkinson even states in his comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| I am building this home as my personal home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| and have counted on this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| Regardless of if Mr. Wilkinson thinks the sight lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| are 250 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| it is clear the expectation of the county is 300 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| which he cannot meet in an area of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| that the speed limit is regularly violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| On June 12th, 2014, it was clearly stated by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| that we will not permit any additional access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| from this project to Nubbin Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| And frankly, the suggestion that the addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| of another driveway is safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| because of a giant yellow school bus with flashing lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| that stops there in the middle of the day is irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| At issue is what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| on an already dangerous portion of Nubbin Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| in the dark of night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| as someone comes around a blind curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| at 30 to 40 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| when there are no lights at the entry of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| his driveway, and multiple cars exiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| that are not large, yellow, and covered in safety lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| Additionally, Mr. Wilkinson has not been forthcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| about his intentions for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| On July 18th, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| he updated the address for his company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Mortgage Direct, to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| This clearly means Mr. Wilkinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| intends to run a business out of his residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| So not only will the neighborhood be subjected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| to the construction needs of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| but appears will be satisfying the parking needs of his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| in addition to the traffic that we added to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| In fact, he has consistently been parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| in the neighborhood entrance for the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| blocking the safe entry and exit of residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| which he did as recently as yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| to take pictures of children exiting the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| I would like to clarify that he has not suffered any hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| as it turned, as he, I'm sorry, he has not purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| has not served, I have braces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| and it's very difficult to speak with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| that he has not suffered any hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| as he has turned his purchase that included this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| into 32 homes, the last of which sold for $722,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| And it was his choice to spend $26,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| clearing a site that has always been known to be unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| As this was originally designated as hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| Mr. Wilkinson should return the lot to its previous state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| to stop the continued erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| into the Penrose Terrace Detention Pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| Finally, you have seen what I've submitted in the public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| that reveals the way Mr. Wilkinson engages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| with the residents of Penrose Terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| He has told us to give him what he wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| or face having 8502 Noven Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| become a storage and parking lot for his construction company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| and send an image of his graffiti trailer to make his point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| It took me all of five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| to confirm with the county that this cannot happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| I believe Mr. Wilkinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| being the experienced developer that he is, knows this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| but wanted to use the fact that he thought we wouldn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| as a means to get what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| I request that when you deny, which I believe you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| that you also make it clear to Mr. Wilkinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| that he cannot use a residentially zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| and unbuildable lot in this manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| so as to avoid any additional issues with him in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| Any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| Ladies and gentlemen of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| my name is Christina Chug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| and I live at 1317 Feather Rose Lane in Penrose Terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| You have submitted before you a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| by the neighborhood of Penrose Terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| Please note that I do not represent that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| I do not represent the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| I am on the HOA board, but I do not represent the HOA today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| I represent myself personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| I just want to state that I feel really uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| with someone taking pictures of my child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| as she gets off the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| I hope that all of you would have a problem with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| A school bus stop in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| does not indicate that the area is a safe place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| for an additional driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| It indicates that it is unsafe and unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| to expect children to walk down Nubbin Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| where there is high traffic, speeding traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| a very steep grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| It is also unreasonable to have them walk down Nubbin Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| to another place to get on the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| The school bus cannot turn around in Penrose Terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| So why would the school bus stop be somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| It cannot be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| It doesn't mean it's a safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Mr. Wilkinson has also argued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| that others have not maintained their sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| along Nubbin Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Therefore, you should approve his variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| This indicates an unwillingness to follow the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| and if you give him an inch, he will take a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| Let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| The entrance to Penrose Terrace, which Mr. Wilkinson built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| was told that it needed to maintain the sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| He did up until this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| Just this fall, this past fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| Mr. Wilkinson planted holly bushes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| in the sight lines of the exit on Penrose Terrace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| right on Nubbin Ridge Road, right in the sight lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| The HOA to Penrose Terrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| is currently in process of removing those holly bushes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| because, as you and I know, holly bushes grow to be quite large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| and there's no way the traffic can see around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| This property that's in question is unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| It has been unbuildable for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| It does not have an entrance or an exit on Nubbin Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| Mr. Wilkinson has known this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| but has still proceeded to clear the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| causing drainage issues for our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| I hereby request that you follow staff recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| and deny Condition 1 and any variants on 8502 Nubbin Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Chugg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| Let's see, is Mr. Baisley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| Any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| Seeing no other opposition, would the applicant like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| Again, I'm Melanie Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| This is Rick Wilkinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| who's proposing to build on the property currently owned by his brother, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| A little bit of history on what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| trying to piece it together from 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| My client, as developers, did not originally develop this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| or do the plat they bought as a successor developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| I believe Rick would testify that he and his brother would have never agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| to have said anything about this particular lot being unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| That did not make it to the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| That was something in the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| but that this property, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| is not actually on the plat as being part of that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| or with any notes restricting its future use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| It was something mentioned in the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| So I think that's important to note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| that that's not something that they ever agreed to or would have agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| and it's not something that made it to where it could have been on a plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| and potentially been more binding than it is on a prior 2014 concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| The property is unusually shaped, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| It is a triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| That is one of the reasons that the request also includes some setback variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| very slight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| The main issue, however, appears to be the concern with sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| Generally, there's 300 feet of sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| because that is a 30-mile-per-hour zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| My client does meet 250 feet in both directions from his driveway as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| We have included in the packet information from a surveyor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| showing many other examples on this same road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| of properties that do not have the minimum 250 sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| This is a curvy road in other places, far curvier than it is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| This is a relative straightaway on this road, on Nubbin Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| So we would ask you to consider that on this somewhat curvy road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| this would have far more sight distance than at least five other houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| as documented by our engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| As far as the sight distance is concerned, coming from Ebenezer Road going east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| the speed limit is 30, and then there's a sign that says it drops to 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| a sign that says it drops to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| This was news to me, but we're being told that the 15 is just a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| and not something that is necessarily binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| So that would mean that the sight distance, according to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| would be the 300 feet as opposed to the 250 minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| If the speed limit of 15 or 25 were actually enforceable as set forth on the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5686)|
| 1:34:54| then the 250 minimum that we have met would be sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| to meet the sight distance requirements without any sort of variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| The other way, coming from the west, the road takes a sharp turn to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| and has a yellow warning sign at the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| A driver has to slow down significantly in order to make that curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| so we submit that even though it's 30 miles an hour going that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| that's not an actual realistic speed for somebody who is just coming off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| making that curve and is going into that relative straightaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| There was mention of a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| The reason for that is that there is a school bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| They're in front of Penrose Terrace subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| which is just diagonal from where my client's proposed driveway would be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| Obviously, there's enough sight distance understood by people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| who decide where school buses are going to stop to see that school bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| and be able to safely come to a stop when it is dropping off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| or picking up kids every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| It's our position that one more driveway for one small house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| is not going to make any material difference in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| It's also our position that there have been no documented drainage issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| or any issues of that type as mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| So we submit that under the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| 250 is a sufficient sight distance for both directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| and that really was the reason it looked like for denying the request on the setbacks as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5777)|
| 1:36:23| was the sight distance concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| So if you are satisfied that along that road with the other conditions being out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| worse than what my client's proposed driveway would present with sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| and that we have met the 250 sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| even though the sign says the speed limit there is 15 going one direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| then we submit that this variance is appropriate and should be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| It's just for a small single-family house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| allows my client to have economic use of its property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| It otherwise is a flat and usable piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| Anything else, Mr. Wilkinson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| I'd just like to say that I had a site survey done by Richard Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| and coming from Ebenezer Road to the location, it's in the packet too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| he tested five different driveways of which none of them met the 300-foot sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| Number two, I think three of them didn't even meet the 250-foot sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5834)|
| 1:37:22| I just want to note that if you look at the zoning page that's in the package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| when I first called CODES to get my building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| I was told it was zoned just like the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| and that all I had to do was do a 15-foot back setback for the triangle part of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| and that I had five feet on the sides and 20 feet on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| So CODES gave me the green light to design a custom house for this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| and that's why I started clearing the lot and started getting the lot prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| I would have never done that had CODES not misled me in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| So I just ask you guys to the minimum sight distance is 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| Whether this is concluded in Penrose Terrace or not, I guess that's whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| I should be granted the sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| It clearly says that the residential regulations say the minimum is 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| I meet that 250, and if you give me the sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| all the other variances I think should be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| and I'd appreciate it if you guys would vote that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| I have a question for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| and I know the staff member who's managing this case isn't here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| So who is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| Porsche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| Something that the opposition said at the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| about this should be common space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| or was supposed to be common space for the neighborhood proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| I can try to look up the concept plan prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| and see if it was noted as open space on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| I don't have prior knowledge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| While we do that, I'm going to move to Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| I'll come back to you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Could we pull up that plan, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| I just wanted to know if we could look at that while we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Could you enlighten us on the posted speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| and the minimum sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| if there's not a posted speed limit at 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| And are there signs that you all have potentially put out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| to do less speeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| or is that just somebody that's put personal signs up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| Can you fill us in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| And then also, after you get through with all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| explain your recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| because I think there is a recommendation from Steve in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| Mr. Elliott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| that says that they recommend denial based on a speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| and a sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| That's correct, Mr. Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| Yeah, there is the posted regulatory speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| on Novens Ridge Road at 30 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| There are curves and hills and various geometric features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| that do allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| or we want to advise people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| that they need to take a little extra caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Those are called advisory speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| Those are not enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| They're suggestions, you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| based on the curvature of the road in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| Novens Ridge Road is a collector in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| We have a lot of complaints about the speeding along Novens Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| the operation of traffic along Novens Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| and in our professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| this not having the 300 feet of sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| because those signs are suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| It's our personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| that professional experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| that people tend to drive much faster than those suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| and oftentimes even faster than the posted speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| So we would feel as if the creation of this driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| could create unsafe conditions along Novens Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| So I would not be in support of this approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| Now we'll come back to Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| Yes, so it appears the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| has this particular parcel with a hatch over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| so it's not labeled as common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| but due to the condition in the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| that it be listed as unbuildable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| I would assume that the hatch is just pointing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| that it's not a buildable lot as part of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| You can see the hatch on the screen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| I'd like to make a motion we deny per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| So on the first motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| is to deny the variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| and reduce the minimum site distance for new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| And that was made by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| I guess we need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| Make a motion we deny per staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Motion two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Motion two, the recommendation is to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| the request to remove condition one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| from the concept plan approval 10-SB-14-C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| because the site does not have safe access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| to Novenridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| We have a motion by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| Seeing no other, oh I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6207)|

| 1:43:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| Carol, entertain a third motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| I'll make the motion but I won't add any details to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| The recommendation to deny motion number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| is made by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| Second by Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6239)|
| 1:44:19| I'm being urged to take let's say a 10-minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| and we will resume after that short break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| All right, let's resume with agenda item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6267)|

| 1:44:39| Location east of Bob Kirby Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6279)|

| 1:44:46| Existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6286)|

| 1:44:58| with up to three detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6298)|

| 1:45:08| Zeb Beeson, 6741 Ball Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| I'm the surveyor representing the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| Seeing no, we do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| Robbie Sands, 1305 Sloping Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| There's a lot of confusion around the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| and what they're trying to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| I've had several conversations just today alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| with the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| trying to get a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| of what they're trying to do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| To the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| to the residents of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| and I am one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| it seems like the wording in the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| is that they could put multiple homes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| And it's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| after talking in between breaks and stuff with the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| that they're just trying to put one single property on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| and then they have slotted off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| or surveyed out another parcel to put another home on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| So there's two homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| With the neighborhood residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| it's our understanding that they're putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| multiple properties in, like a true subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| And maybe it's the ignorance of myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| and potential residents in the neighborhood beside it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| on what they're trying to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| So I guess my question to you before I go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| and waste everybody's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| is how many homes can they put on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| with the proposal that they are going with for zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| And I'll direct you to Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| So the approval is for a residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| with up to three detached dwellings on individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| And if it was just an individual home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| that they were trying to put on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| they would not have to get that zoning, that type of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| if they were just building, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| their forever home on that parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| So there will be three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| This will be subdivided into three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| And they can have one home on each of those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| So moving forward, if it is a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| they're trying to put there, a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| I wanted to thank you guys for your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| and address a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| So who am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| To two, I'm a father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| To one, I'm a husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| To most, I'm a real estate agent and investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| To the community, I'm proud to say that I've lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| in the Hardin Valley and Carnes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| I'm the fifth generation to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| You know, I went, as so many with my non-college background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6476)|
| 1:48:03| went to look up reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| that maybe there shouldn't be a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| behind our residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| And I came up with 50 different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| And you know these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Like, you guys are, I'm sure, extremely educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| You know the majority of the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| that would probably be proposed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| 150 I probably got, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| of reasons that we would not like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| a neighborhood in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| But with this, like, going through all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| the biggest concern for a potential neighborhood here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| is the road that it is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| If you've been down on Bob Kirby or Bob Gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| you can see that it's, from the map view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| it's straight down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| It doesn't look too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| But it is a blind corner, a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| And then if you scroll a little higher up on your map there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| you can see that there's also an off-angle chute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| that comes in as well that's taken quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| And so, you know, I spent Saturday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| ironically, this past Saturday there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| trying to help some folks from an accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| that occurred on this stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| And chopping, you know, cleaning up trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| They backed up traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| And it's just, it's already not big enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| for a development to go in there for the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| The road needs to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| There potentially needs to be a guardrail on there to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| I don't think that those things will probably ever happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| One of those things that it's needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| but we'll never see it, you know, probably for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| But the things, as I was making this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| the things that come to me that really hit home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| were the things that my children are going to miss out on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| And those are intangibles that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| I couldn't present really to you or show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| Some of those things that my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| and the neighborhood children, you know, along with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| would miss out on would be the privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| the safety that they could play in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| without being fearful of who might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| in the neighborhood behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| A couple other things are obviously the wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| The animals walk up right to our back door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| which is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Our kids get to experience, you know, rabbits and bunnies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| and birds and deer at their doorstep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| The quiet nights by the fire pit roasting marshmallows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| you know, is something that we really enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| And we are blessed to be able to have an amazing view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| of the sunset and the reassurance that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| I don't know if I can say that, but that God is present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| because no one could paint a more beautiful sunset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| every night as we eat dinner with our children by our window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| If you move forward on a somewhat vague proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| as the council, it would feel like you were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| it would feel like it was a desire to assist the few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6676)|
| 1:51:24| before the desires of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| And so I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Sands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| Any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| Mr. Beeson, would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| It is our intentions to not build a, do a huge development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| They just want to subdivide this into three lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| keeping the existing home on lot two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6709)|

| 1:51:55| and selling the third lot to build a third residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| I guess I'm having a little difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| why somebody would oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| I mean, you've got three homes on 8.4 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| when it's currently zoned PR at 2.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| That would give you well over almost, what, 20 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| I guess I find it hard to think that you oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| Nice sunsets and agricultural and vegetation and wildlife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| all very nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| but we can't deny someone the reasonable use of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| for aesthetic reasons or natural reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| I'm going to make a motion that we approve the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| We have a motion to approve per staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| seconded by Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| and seeing no other lights, all in favor say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| I'm sorry, just in the nick of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| It's down to the eight count here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| Pat, did you say rezoning in your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| Because it's not zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| It says subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| You're right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| I approve the subdivision for three lots per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| I'll amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| Is that why you stopped this whole procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6827)|

| 1:54:32| Is the applicant available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| David Chibbon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| My address, 5331 Kane Road, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| We have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Chibbon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Chibbon, let him speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6889)|
| 1:54:58| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| My name is James Sherrill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| My wife and I have lived at 1112 Roderick Road in Knoxville for the past 46 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| So we've seen a lot come and go in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| The southwest corner of the area under review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| and the northeast corner of my lot meet at the lowest point in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| where all the water from the area under review drains to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| And there's also six or seven other properties that also drain to that same spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| Now, on my property there, I have a tiled ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| which runs down the east side of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| and then down at the front goes under Roderick Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| It goes on for probably miles after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| There are nine children who live in the first three properties that line up against that ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6947)|
| 1:55:58| The work done on Middlebrook Pike a number of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| to widen it to a four-lane divided highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6961)|
| 1:56:10| caused most of the property under review to be 10 or 12 feet below the surface of Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| in essence creating a bowl out of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| There's a lot of water that lands there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| You can't see it on that drawing, I don't guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| but a big portion of that water comes from Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| because there's a couple of catch basins up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| and at least one of them drains water directly onto this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| Once it reaches there, it meanders across the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| until it comes down to the corner that intersects with my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| The amount of water and the velocity at which it hits that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| is already increased by them simply taking the brush and other vegetation off of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7010)|
| 1:57:00| Building four duplexes on this site, I think, is only going to make that worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| because of the roofs and the downspout systems that these facilities will have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7024)|
| 1:57:13| Can you put their site plan up there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7033)|
| 1:57:20| Okay, as you can see from the site plan there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| their plan appears to be to get all the water off of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| It contains two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| One is on the north or front side of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| There's a private road that will be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| That private road will have a catch basin down on the west end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| which drains into the retention pond that you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| In addition to that, there are three swales that surround the other three sides of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| Of course, the one on the west side there includes a retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| Of course, the water from those swales and from that retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| and the water that drains off of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| drains directly to the corner there where my property touches this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7083)|
| 1:58:10| One of the catch basins that's up on Middlebrook Pike, as you can see from that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| will be drained into an underground pipe which will take it directly to the south and southern swale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| which here again takes it to the corner of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| While they've done a lot of work on coming up with a water management plan there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| it appears to me that all of that plan is to take care of their property and doesn't do much for mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7110)|
| 1:58:48| I guess I'm just wondering what they're going to do to not only protect me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| but other people down the course of where that water runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7133)|
| 1:59:01| You don't see it on this plan, but those four duplexes that will be put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| will obviously have roofs and gutter systems and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| My guess is that there will be some kind of piping that will be put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| that will drain that water either to the retention pond or the southern swale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| which here again will eventually all run down and get onto my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| I have a concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| In addition to all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7170)|
| 1:59:38| these four duplexes, and of course each one of the units in that will have three bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7178)|
| 1:59:47| so there will be a total of eight homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| In my estimation that could place a minimum of 32 people living in this area down in this bowl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| which here again means if there's two working adults there, members of those families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| there will be 16 vehicles coming off of Middlebrook Pike down into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| There's no crossover on Middlebrook Pike there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| so that means coming out of that area it's right turn only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| Mr. Sherrill, if you could wrap up please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| If you could wrap up, we're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| I thought I had five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| But anyway, the point is this doesn't appear to be a very safe area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| to have a lot of extra traffic coming out of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| The speed limit there is 45 miles an hour, but nobody drives that slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| Plus the other thing, there's lots of single-family housing that surrounds this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7235)|
| 2:00:43| and it just seems like to me that it would be out of character to just pluck four duplexes down in the middle of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7243)|
| 2:00:50| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Sherrill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| Mr. Chabon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| So basically, as the person mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| we have a water retention way of how to hold all the water from all the houses into the retention fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7261)|
| 2:01:10| and then slowly release it in down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| And so any water situation that will be caused, it will go straight into the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| All the swells and all the roofs and everything will be draining into that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| And so, I mean, that's how we design it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| Mr. Harbin has done the design on this, so he could say something more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| But basically, I think we are – there were three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| We're making four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| And if we did three houses on there without any retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| that would have been – the situation would have been much worse than what we're doing with the retention fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| and I think that will actually improve the situation on the ground over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| So with that in mind, I'd like to ask that you guys approve as recommended by the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Because of the recommendations of staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| which is meeting all the requirements of TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| and obviously they're not going to allow an access that isn't safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| I do think that it's hard to imagine a new single-family house being built on a four-lane divided highway like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7336)|
| 2:02:24| I think this is an excellent use of this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| and also appears that we're going to be going through engineering and public works on this detention basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| which will give Mr. Harbin a chance to make sure that all that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7351)|
| 2:02:35| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| Somebody help me on a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| I had about three of them at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| We're going to go with Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| So we got – what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7370)|

| 2:02:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| So we had the motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| and we still have lights, or do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7385)|

| 2:04:19| We're getting ready to build up on Bearden Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| but we found that this facility for our custard drive-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| and walk-up only would really work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| We took the time, and I reached out to Commissioner Oster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| and she put together last Sunday a meeting with the community so that we could sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| down and talk with the housing developments and everybody in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| We had a really good turnout, about 25 to 30 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| I don't know the final count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| And even one of the people who were online that sort of had the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| or what they wanted to talk about, by the end of that meeting she really understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| that we really are a good fit for this position, and I will correct one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7497)|

| 2:09:48| on behalf of Daniel Levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| I would like to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7798)|
| 2:10:07| Ms. Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7807)|
| 2:10:20| I just want to start out first to say, yes, the sound system does and can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| I'd really like whoever is in charge of the building to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7826)|
| 2:10:31| we cannot hear most of the time in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| That being said, I just want to say, hey, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7835)|
| 2:10:41| Thank you for the time that you guys put into your work on planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7841)|
| 2:10:48| I'm not going to make it a habit, I don't think, of coming down before you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| but June 11, 2020 was my last planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| and one of my last votes on planning commission was with regards to Ancient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| Lower Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| It was a vote that gave the use on review request commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7864)|
| 2:11:10| I knew this vote would not please some of my South Knoxville neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| but the request was a change from a temporary tent and administrative building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| to a permanent building, which made sense for a rural retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| especially since it allowed for accessibility and would give some protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| from sound pollution from indoor events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| I spent some time today reviewing the archive video of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| Many commissioners, including some of you sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| expressed concern that the development was approved in March of the same year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| with specific conditions, and it was inappropriate to return so soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| asking for changes to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| My comment to Mr. Levy after the vote was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| I'm hopeful this is the end of your request on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| to which Mr. Levy replied, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| I enjoyed talking to you all, but hopefully we don't do it again anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| My South Knoxville neighbors said they'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| They're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| Adding seven additional accommodations is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| This developer continues to push boundaries that were established in March 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| through much input from the surrounding neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| and was adapted in June 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| Again, I request that you oppose these additional accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7948)|
| 2:12:35| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| Thank you, Ms. Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| Any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7958)|
| 2:12:45| Corinne Rivetti, 6925 Sevierville Pike, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| I'm here to represent myself as the adjacent property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| and the Keep the Urban Wilderness Peaceful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| which is the community that is impacted by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| ALV was denied commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| and yet it operates as a commercial business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| under the guise of the rural retreat guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| Weekly scheduled brunches, movies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| trivia events are open to the public as in any commercially run business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=7996)|
| 2:13:22| ALV is a venue that consistently does not play by the rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| pushes boundaries, violates the regulations it is bound by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| acts in unethical ways as in bribing adjacent property owners for reduced setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8012)|
| 2:13:40| and fails to follow through on many other agreements and conditions that are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| For example, it recently was found to be in violation of the rural retreat ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| by city codes enforcement and must remediate these infringements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| We're waiting on a time schedule for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| It's taken our community three years to recently finally negotiate agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| regarding previously set conditions from 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| as oversight and enforcement of conditions is practically nonexistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| The above-cited action is the first one that we're aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| regarding this project despite numerous filed complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| In June 2020, this very body, after a long and convoluted process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8062)|
| 2:14:27| told ALV not to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| Daniel's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| Daniel was the one who agreed that they would not be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| And yet the approved project from 2020 is still under construction, and yet they're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8074)|
| 2:14:44| So our residential community has lived with continuous construction for five years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8084)|
| 2:14:52| and they're asking for more construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| What gives here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| Is there no end to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| And when the daily construction subsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| then comes the weekend with events, noise, lights, music, screaming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| and sometimes we've had drunken attendees knocking on residents' doors in the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8111)|
| 2:15:17| clearly exceeding and violating rural retreat regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| And this proposal will double the occupancy up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| which means double the people, the noise, the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| We live with constant interruption to the protected expectations of living in a residential environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8129)|
| 2:15:37| Don, how many times have we called the police for noise ordinance violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8137)|
| 2:15:43| I actually quit calling the police after I talked to Tom Welker of the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| and said that his officers are not allowed to do anything when it comes to the county code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8148)|
| 2:15:56| Ms. Rivetti, we can't have this back and forth with the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| Basically, the officers have no idea about what rural retreat is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| and therefore it renders enforcement a total farce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| A commercial entity has no place in an agricultural residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| We have accepted ALV's presence, tried to coexist, and find some peaceful solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8172)|
| 2:16:19| Mostly, we've been dismissed and disrespected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| At the June 2020 meeting, it was stated by planning staff that this ordinance is ambiguous and unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8184)|
| 2:16:31| Our community is living proof of suffering the consequences of this poorly defined and vague ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8191)|
| 2:16:40| which is challenged by a venue that believes that it is above the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| and exempt from complying with the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| There's a long history here, and I hope some of you have dove into that history a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| We tried to provide some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| I'm about to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| Once again, we ask that this request be denied or at least delayed until the rural retreat ordinance is cleaned up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8216)|
| 2:17:05| and everyone knows and abides by the regulations as defined, no exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8225)|
| 2:17:12| We want a guarantee that clear measures for oversight and enforcement are in place before anything else happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8232)|
| 2:17:21| Thanks for your time, and if you would like some examples of known and ignored violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8241)|
| 2:17:28| I will be happy to provide those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| Ms. McGee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8255)|
| 2:17:40| Olivia McGee, 2425 McCammon Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8260)|
| 2:17:46| And again, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| I'm the Director of Finance and Operations at Ancient Lore Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| Let me introduce the vision of Ancient Lore Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| It's one of a time where peace existed, one where good overcame evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| It's one of simpler times, and I kind of laugh about that now in this day and age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| One where we brought people together, regardless of their interests, their background, their political stance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8285)|
| 2:18:12| their race, their religion, or their economic background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| One where there was a give and take, and it just wasn't dismissive or disruptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| if you didn't agree with somebody else's ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| And I can say proudly that we as a management team and our fantastic group of village staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8303)|
| 2:18:28| have and continue to strive to deliver that environment on our end these past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| where we can bring people together to have a peaceful place for guests and achieve a simpler time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8314)|
| 2:18:40| We've brought to Knoxville a unique, very unique, tax-generating, positive-giving venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8320)|
| 2:18:47| where good can exist and good can come out of our goals and our mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| Currently, in two years, we've given over $75,000 in gift and kind donations to nonprofits, community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8331)|
| 2:18:58| ones such as Knoxville Zoo, Make-A-Wish Foundation, East Tennessee Children's Hospital, the local schools, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8338)|
| 2:19:06| We've been committed to making a difference in our community, just as our values and our mission statement shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| The reason for our ask and adding additional overnight accommodations is simple, very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8351)|
| 2:19:18| We've had so many requests from groups hosting events with us to provide us, provide them, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8358)|
| 2:19:24| more of our unique but luxury dwellings and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| From corporations looking for a place to stay, weddings which bring guests from out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| who want their guests to be on site with them, to both local and out-of-town guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| who want to stay in a more peaceful setting outside of the tourist areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| Our data collected provides the information needed that these accommodations would benefit the need in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8382)|
| 2:19:47| We aren't your overgrown and tourist type of venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8387)|
| 2:19:51| In fact, it's different from when we started five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| What we used to see was the runoff from the mud pit on Nixon Road, where we are currently at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| Now, we have gardens and trails that are nice to walk through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8403)|
| 2:20:10| We now had two abandoned houses at the end of Chapman Highway and Nixon Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8410)|
| 2:20:16| that was bringing in homeless people and had drug use going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8416)|
| 2:20:20| We took the ability and tore those houses down so that it would make our neighborhoods more safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| to clean up that area that we own on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| We've continued to pour into our wildlife with mineral blocks, feeders, native plants for the habitat to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| We see turkeys, deers, otters, everything all the time, and our guests love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| We planted numerous, numerous trees, thousands and thousands of dollars where dead trees once were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| We weekly keep up picking up trash along the property limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| but nobody else seems to do that in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8450)|
| 2:20:53| and so we're really trying to keep this area nice and an area to be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| We've made many adjustments and architectural design changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| not required by law or by codes to accommodate the neighborhood request on lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| on sound barriers, at our own expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| You can see that from some prior submissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| and I've got a handout if you'd like to see some of those things that we've put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| While many of our neighbors think that we're the ones creating noise over the 9 p.m. curfew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| that the rural retreat does we have to abide by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| it's been proven that that wasn't us with music or gunshots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| We have a strict noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| We have decibel readers on the property all over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| and I'm very strict with our staff to make sure that we abide by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| Our guests are coming, and they're wanting a peaceful setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| and that's what we're trying to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| It's not been us creating in the neighborhood the noise issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| but unfortunately, and I hate to say this, unhappy neighbors who were against us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| and it's disheartening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| Maybe they felt there's no other way to get something resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| but it just can't be a successful answer for anybody in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| We don't feel the addition of the new dwellings will add to any noise from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| Since last fall, we had worked diligently with various neighbors to help meet their wants and needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| and we've been able to reach some solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| but unfortunately I do say we're not going to be able to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| Now I'm going to say to you as a South Knoxville resident, born and raised, raising my children here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8537)|
| 2:22:23| I've been here for 48 years, and I'm involved in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| and when the bridge shut down a few years back, it impacted our South Knoxville community drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8547)|
| 2:22:33| We lost well-established, longstanding businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| Our property values went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| We lost jobs, and more people became homeless and started moving into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| The vision for this specific business has always been from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| to bring something back to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| They never have taken taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| We're privately owned by over 50 shareholders, some of those in this neighborhood, not just Tom Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| Multiple ones are in our neighborhood who do support us, and, you know, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| South Knoxville, we're a proud group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| We want our land undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| We want our land to stay the way it is, but Knoxville is a growing city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| and we've got a lot of development even an eighth of a mile from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| That's a lot worse than what we are with lots of things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| So what we're coming to you today, you know, we must abide by the law for safety for our guests and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8603)|
| 2:23:30| We can't be demanded differently for our neighbors to have something different for their personal wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| Our growth and how we incorporate these additional dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| will also be absorbed into the landscape as a natural retreat to enhance the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| I ask of you, the Planning Commission, three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| One, that you approve the additional dwellings we proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| Two, to remove the lighting condition to match the previous rule retreat approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| as it will be a life safety issue not to have pathways and egress ways lit up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| when guests and staff and property past the curfews are mentioned are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| And then three, the sale and ordinance is a very big deal for all of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8643)|
| 2:24:08| and for us as a business we're operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| There's very, it's as they've said, we want peace just as much as they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| And we don't know how to obtain that with the decibel readings and things in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| And we need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Thank you, Ms. McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| Ms. Rivetti or Ms. Toker, I'll let all of you run over a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8663)|
| 2:24:28| but if you all would like another 45 seconds, you're welcome to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8668)|
| 2:24:37| I would just like to add, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| we have learned that we have to live with ALV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| It's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| We've accepted that as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| What we cannot accept is the continual interruptions that occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8687)|
| 2:24:52| We have tried to make some arrangements, and we've made some agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| We have sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| We have tried with codes to do things, and we continue to hit roadblocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| And, you know, asking for reduction in what, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| this is basically operating as a commercial business in the middle of a residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8708)|
| 2:25:15| It's kind of unheard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| If it were truly operating as a rural retreat, you know, that would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| But I think almost everybody, including staff, planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| has agreed with me that they are pushing the boundaries greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8726)|
| 2:25:31| Ms. Rivetti, if I let you run over, I'll never get out of this pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| So I just want to say that that is a serious consideration before we relax any conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8735)|
| 2:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| Thank you all for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8745)|
| 2:25:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| I just wanted to ‑‑ I want clarity on what was approved and what the request is and what is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8749)|
| 2:25:59| So the proposal is to increase from 9 to 14, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8759)|
| 2:26:07| From 7 to 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| Currently they have, as I understand it, seven units available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| but they were allowed up to nine originally, or at least they were approved up to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8776)|
| 2:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8781)|
| 2:26:22| So pause there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8782)|
| 2:26:23| They were approved for up to nine in whatever month, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| Lisa, I'm looking at the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| Is that rural retreat in 2020 allowed a maximum of nine guest accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8789)|
| 2:26:38| but only seven were constructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| Ms. Porsche, would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| Sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| So the original approval was for nine overnight accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| That was the March of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| It came back in June of 2020, and it did not alter that nine accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| It just converted the tent to a building and added some other features around the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| So only seven were constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| So there's that two that's languishing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| So if you all were to approve the additional seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| then that other two that they got approval for, they'd either have to pick and choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| Because the way that the staff report is written, it says total 14 accommodated units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8830)|
| 2:27:17| So if you all approved this seven for a total of 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| then they would be able to do either these seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| or some combination of five of these and two of those, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| But either way, they wouldn't be able to do more than 14 units based on the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| and the acreage of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| This is where I'm getting a little confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| and it's because the approval that happened previously was for nine total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8857)|
| 2:27:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| And so the request that's coming now is asking to exceed what was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8865)|
| 2:27:51| It's asking for seven additional units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8874)|
| 2:27:55| And the staff reports capped it at 14 based on the acreage and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8875)|
| 2:28:01| The staff recommendation in the report that we're looking at now capped it at 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8881)|
| 2:28:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| But that is going beyond what was originally approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8889)|
| 2:28:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230309?start=8902)|
