| 5:09:49| Public forum shall be held on the first meeting of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18589)|
| 5:09:53| Each person appearing shall be allowed three minutes unless otherwise provided by the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18593)|
| 5:09:59| A total of 30 minutes will be allocated for public forum on a first-come, first-saved basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18599)|
| 5:10:05| It is the duty of the Chair to keep track of the time for each speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18605)|
| 5:10:08| and to inform the speaker when his or her time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18608)|
| 5:10:11| Citizens appearing before the Board shall state their name and residential address or business address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18611)|
| 5:10:16| Employees of Knox County only need to state their first and last name, title, and department name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18616)|
| 5:10:20| So the ordinance before us, if I understand it correctly, is to mandate that they do what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18620)|
| 5:10:27| which is to do five minutes and it does not have a predetermined time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18627)|
| 5:10:33| And it's every meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18633)|
| 5:10:35| And at every meeting versus once per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18635)|
| 5:10:38| That's the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18638)|
| 5:10:40| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18640)|
| 5:10:42| Is that clarified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18642)|
| 5:10:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18643)|
| 5:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18644)|
| 5:10:45| I do have one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18645)|
| 5:10:46| If the Board of Health, if the state were to change the duties of the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18646)|
| 5:10:49| and the statutory powers of the Board of Health, would this ordinance still stand or need to stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18649)|
| 5:10:59| I guess need to stand would be a policy question, so that's not a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18659)|
| 5:11:03| Would it continue to stand if they didn't, as you say, I'll ask you this, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18663)|
| 5:11:07| if somebody did not have the powers that they had and we had an ordinance placed that told this other body how to do their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18667)|
| 5:11:14| would it stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18674)|
| 5:11:16| Ordinances always stay on the books until you take them off, but we could vote to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18676)|
| 5:11:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18682)|
| 5:11:23| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18683)|
| 5:11:24| Is that correct, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18684)|
| 5:11:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18686)|
| 5:11:27| Dr. Buchanan, I want to give you a chance to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18687)|
| 5:11:31| You sent the letter, and I read the letter, and I went ahead and glanced over it again on this item here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18691)|
| 5:11:37| Since the chairman of the Board of Health is not here, but this is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18697)|
| 5:11:43| If we vote yes, we could kill it if we vote no, but if we vote yes, that means we've got to hear it next month anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18703)|
| 5:11:49| So between now and then, I may change my mind between now and then, but I'll vote yes just to proceed to make it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18709)|
| 5:11:57| I'll be voting yes just to make it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18717)|
| 5:12:00| Dr. Buchanan, I want to give you an opportunity to speak for the board, if you would, about how do you feel about the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18720)|
| 5:12:10| Well, first, I'm really not authorized or designated to speak for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18730)|
| 5:12:15| Okay, then speak for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18735)|
| 5:12:17| I can speak as a member of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18737)|
| 5:12:20| This is a level of logistical challenge for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18740)|
| 5:12:28| One of the things that we'll be doing, I'll be doing with some of our COVID money, and then going forward having to budget for is staff for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18748)|
| 5:12:36| Coordinating public forum takes coordination and takes staff to do that, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18756)|
| 5:12:42| The board wants to hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18762)|
| 5:12:45| They have been hearing from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18765)|
| 5:12:47| They limited the time and the occurrence of that, partly because they honestly, except now, have not been setting policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18767)|
| 5:12:57| They'll probably go back to not setting a lot of policy after the pandemic's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18777)|
| 5:13:02| We've just had the need to have policy-making board or policy-making body during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18782)|
| 5:13:09| We have not been a very heavily policy-oriented department as a health department in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18789)|
| 5:13:18| So, logistically, it's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18798)|
| 5:13:20| They'll step up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18800)|
| 5:13:21| I know they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18801)|
| 5:13:22| They're willing to hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18802)|
| 5:13:25| They will lengthen the meetings like it lengthens your meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18805)|
| 5:13:28| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18808)|
| 5:13:29| People get to have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18809)|
| 5:13:32| But going forward, in order to coordinate that, you all have two staff members and others that help support your meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18812)|
| 5:13:40| We'll need to accommodate that for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18820)|
| 5:13:43| But we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18823)|
| 5:13:45| I think you meet Wednesday, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18825)|
| 5:13:48| We do meet this Wednesday, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18828)|
| 5:13:50| Yeah, you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18830)|
| 5:13:51| We can bring that up and see what – and have the chairman write a letter supporting, not supporting, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18831)|
| 5:13:58| The next question, I guess, is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18838)|
| 5:14:02| Mr. Law Director, you know, our rules are – we're looking at our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18842)|
| 5:14:08| And, no, we're not doing away with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18848)|
| 5:14:10| So, don't say that we're doing away with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18850)|
| 5:14:13| But doesn't the chairman have the discretion to say, like we did tonight, we're going to do public forum for an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18853)|
| 5:14:21| and then we're going to do the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18861)|
| 5:14:24| Has that been – we've been doing that that way since I've been elected four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18864)|
| 5:14:31| And sometimes we've limited it for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18871)|
| 5:14:33| Sometimes we've had a group of people that come and we give them 15 to 20 minutes as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18873)|
| 5:14:40| So, we're not doing anything that's not been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18880)|
| 5:14:45| It's not we're trying to be sneaky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18885)|
| 5:14:47| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18887)|
| 5:14:49| You know, so, I guess, Law Director, I guess the question is, can the chair – how much discretion does the chair have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18889)|
| 5:15:02| As much as this body wants to give him or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18902)|
| 5:15:07| So, six votes, we can –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18907)|
| 5:15:09| Basically, you've got six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18909)|
| 5:15:11| You can do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18911)|
| 5:15:13| Just call a point of order, call for a vote, and then bring me the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18913)|
| 5:15:19| Or if there's an issue, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18919)|
| 5:15:21| Should not say problem, issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18921)|
| 5:15:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18923)|
| 5:15:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18924)|
| 5:15:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18926)|
| 5:15:27| I think, Commissioner Daley, what you do is call for objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18927)|
| 5:15:33| and then put any ruling he's trying to do to a vote or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18933)|
| 5:15:39| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18939)|
| 5:15:41| You know, I think whenever Chairman Jay, at the beginning of the meeting, stated how things were going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18941)|
| 5:15:50| and how the agenda was going to be set and what public forum was going to be within that agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18950)|
| 5:15:55| and we vote unanimously, that gives him that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18955)|
| 5:16:01| And, you know, another way you could break it out is say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18961)|
| 5:16:04| if we're going to do public forum this way tonight and I need to vote to suspend the rules in order to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18964)|
| 5:16:13| But I think whenever we confirm the agenda unanimously, we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18973)|
| 5:16:18| And our rules give the chairman more discretion in how items on the agenda flow than it ever did before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18978)|
| 5:16:26| but it is without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18986)|
| 5:16:29| So if anybody ever doesn't like the way the changes that are made, all they have to do is say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18989)|
| 5:16:34| object, and then we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18994)|
| 5:16:39| Mr. Chairman, and you're right, and I think if you go back to the last meeting and this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18999)|
| 5:16:45| the chairman has said, this is the way I want to do it as far as setting when we're going to do public forum and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19005)|
| 5:16:52| without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19012)|
| 5:16:54| He asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19014)|
| 5:16:55| He asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19015)|
| 5:16:56| And there's no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19016)|
| 5:16:58| It's like everybody voting on it, but he does ask that question up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19018)|
| 5:17:03| Is there any further discussion on item number 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19023)|
| 5:17:06| This is first reading of ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19026)|
| 5:17:09| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19029)|
| 5:17:10| This is a comment for the law director and actually Dr. Buchanan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19030)|
| 5:17:14| If I think if maybe we could just give the chairman of the Board of Health a quick rundown from David Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19034)|
| 5:17:22| because I know he would probably be able to express how that flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19042)|
| 5:17:25| and maybe the chairman could understand a little bit better Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19045)|
| 5:17:29| Do you think that would help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19049)|
| 5:17:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19051)|
| 5:17:34| Yeah, the board is very aware of this ordinance or this resolution to change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19054)|
| 5:17:41| We're kind of waiting to see which direction you all went this month, knowing that it requires two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19061)|
| 5:17:47| So I'm sure we'll be discussing it on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19067)|
| 5:17:50| and David can certainly clarify things and answer questions for the board at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19070)|
| 5:17:55| And if they choose to have a representative here next month, then that will happen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19075)|
| 5:18:04| Any further discussion on item number 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19084)|
| 5:18:09| We have a first by Commissioner Ward, a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19089)|
| 5:18:12| All in favor, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19092)|
| 5:18:14| Sorry, it's a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19094)|
| 5:18:15| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19095)|
| 5:18:16| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19096)|
| 5:18:17| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19097)|
| 5:18:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19099)|
| 5:18:20| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19100)|

| 5:18:54| 101 is passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19134)|
| 5:18:58| It will come back for us on the second reading next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19138)|
| 5:19:02| We have no ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19142)|
| 5:19:05| Are there any other business before the committee before we do public forum for the second time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19145)|
| 5:19:13| Commissioner, or excuse me, Mr. VanDeWaethe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19153)|
| 5:19:17| Very briefly before you move on to public forum, I did have a follow-up concern I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19157)|
| 5:19:29| to share with you regarding Resolution 904, certainly not to speak to the merits of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19169)|
| 5:19:33| but just to make certain that the Commission leaves with realistic expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19173)|
| 5:19:39| Item 4 requires the Mayor's Office to present to Commission 11 nominees to populate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19179)|
| 5:19:47| body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19187)|
| 5:19:48| By my count, looking at the list in Item 4, at least six of those are going to be credentialed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19188)|
| 5:19:55| professionals who hold some form of licensure, likely from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19195)|
| 5:20:00| So if you're asking us to identify, recruit, vet, and then recommend this group to Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19200)|
| 5:20:09| I realistically do not see how we could possibly do that by the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19209)|
| 5:20:14| The November meeting has moved up due to Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19214)|
| 5:20:17| I think we'll struggle to have them to you by the December meeting, but we'll certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19217)|
| 5:20:22| do our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19222)|
| 5:20:23| Commissioner Ward, I know the resolution is important to you, but we have to find, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19223)|
| 5:20:28| 11 people, six of whom hold license from the state, and all of whom are willing to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19228)|
| 5:20:34| and then we want to make sure before we present them to this body that they have been appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19234)|
| 5:20:38| vetted and they're suitable candidates to be on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19238)|
| 5:20:40| So I would think it would be December before we would be back to you with the nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19240)|
| 5:20:48| Thank you, Mr. Vanderley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19248)|
| 5:20:49| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19249)|
| 5:20:50| Thank you, Mr. Vanderley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19250)|
| 5:20:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19251)|
| 5:20:52| I don't believe that would be any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19252)|
| 5:20:57| That is a lot to ask, and we do not want this to be a rush process, and we would sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19257)|
| 5:21:04| slow time makes better time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19264)|
| 5:21:09| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19269)|
| 5:21:11| Just a point of privilege, Mr. Chairman, I don't want to disrespect any of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19271)|
| 5:21:14| in public forum, but I need a bathroom break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19274)|
| 5:21:17| This meeting will be in recess for seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19277)|
| 5:21:24| Make it quick, Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19284)|
| 5:21:27| We'll be back in 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19287)|
| 5:21:29| I'm going to call this meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19289)|
| 5:21:34| The last item on our agenda is the second half of public forum I announced at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19294)|
| 5:21:44| of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19304)|
| 5:21:45| We will do one hour at the beginning and one hour at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19305)|
| 5:21:48| It is 10.52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19308)|
| 5:21:50| We will adjourn this meeting at 11.52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19310)|
| 5:21:53| I want to remind everybody, once again, all agenda items for November need to be in by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19313)|
| 5:21:58| Wednesday, the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19318)|
| 5:22:01| Please check your schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19321)|
| 5:22:02| This is a short month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19322)|
| 5:22:06| I'm going to go through the list, starting with people who have not spoken to us first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19326)|
| 5:22:10| I am going to ask, just like I did, if you are a Knox County resident, and please hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19330)|
| 5:22:14| that you will be truthful for that and give priority to those who live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19334)|
| 5:22:19| I will give everybody five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19339)|
| 5:22:21| However, we absolutely do not have enough time in that one hour to hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19341)|
| 5:22:27| So if you choose to abbreviate your comments or to condense your comments, more of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19347)|
| 5:22:33| will have an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19353)|
| 5:22:37| I'm going to go through the list, as I always do, and please identify yourself and kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19357)|
| 5:22:43| of be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19363)|
| 5:22:44| First up will be Fran Whiteside, then Joni Brown, Melody Watts, Naomi Elliott, and Tom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19364)|
| 5:22:48| Windom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19368)|
| 5:22:51| Everybody clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19371)|
| 5:22:54| First up is Fran Whiteside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19374)|
| 5:22:56| If you would, please, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19376)|
| 5:22:59| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19379)|
| 5:23:00| Fran Whiteside, Gallagher View, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19380)|
| 5:23:04| Thank you, Ms. Whiteside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19384)|
| 5:23:05| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19385)|
| 5:23:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19387)|
| 5:23:08| While the health board members do need to be appreciated for their attempts during COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19388)|
| 5:23:12| my argument is that the board is not acting in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19392)|
| 5:23:16| The most notable example is the absence of complete evidence when making decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19396)|
| 5:23:20| Let me illustrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19400)|
| 5:23:21| There was a bar-restaurant curfew imposed at 11 p.m. because people have poor judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19401)|
| 5:23:25| when they drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19405)|
| 5:23:26| I contend that some people have poor judgment when they are not drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19406)|
| 5:23:30| Where is the evidence with contact tracing that the actual positive test results were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19410)|
| 5:23:34| coming from those interactions in bars and restaurants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19414)|
| 5:23:36| It was never provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19416)|
| 5:23:38| Not one person on the board even asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19418)|
| 5:23:40| There's been no questioning of the number of hospitalizations or deaths from either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19420)|
| 5:23:44| UT or K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19424)|
| 5:23:45| While those entities are running with their own guidance, they are part of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19425)|
| 5:23:49| and need to be brought to the surface if, in fact, there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19429)|
| 5:23:53| If there are no numbers, then that also needs to be part of the discussion for its decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19433)|
| 5:23:57| value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19437)|
| 5:23:58| At one meeting, it was said that the count of COVID beds was 120, but no one stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19438)|
| 5:24:03| the rest of the beds that totaled 270 for other causes were also being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19443)|
| 5:24:10| The CDC has never in its history before COVID suggested that wearing masks should be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19450)|
| 5:24:14| a requirement for everyday life unless a person is sick, yet the board continues to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19454)|
| 5:24:19| that this is the answer to our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19459)|
| 5:24:21| They won't even discuss the fact that people are reusing masks, not wearing them properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19461)|
| 5:24:25| hanging them from their rearview mirrors and touching them over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19465)|
| 5:24:29| Case in point is this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19469)|
| 5:24:32| And I'm sure you all know that every time you touch your mask, you're supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19472)|
| 5:24:35| either washing your hands or sanitizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19475)|
| 5:24:39| According to the CDC current handout on community interventions for infection control, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19479)|
| 5:24:43| is not one mention of masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19483)|
| 5:24:45| The CDC non-pharmaceutical interventions for influenza pandemics only list the words, might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19485)|
| 5:24:51| recommend for very high severity to extreme pandemic, no requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19491)|
| 5:24:56| During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when a new virus emerged, there was no protocol listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19496)|
| 5:25:01| for wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19501)|
| 5:25:02| The words are not recommended unless you are directly working with an infected person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19502)|
| 5:25:07| The 2017 mitigation guidelines for pandemics and influenza only says to use masks with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19507)|
| 5:25:12| those that are ill, even in cases of high to very high transmissibility and severity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19512)|
| 5:25:18| If cases go down, they say masks work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19518)|
| 5:25:20| If cases go up, they say people don't mask enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19520)|
| 5:25:24| Since masks are magic, counterexamples are dismissed and everyone ignores the harm of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19524)|
| 5:25:28| forcing masks while refusing to seek a better explanations for any spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19528)|
| 5:25:32| This is the main issue with the mask mandate argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19532)|

| 5:30:37| Power is what we are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19837)|

| 5:31:04| Half of you are choosing to wear a mask, half of you are not, but you respect one another's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19864)|

| 5:31:12| That's all that we are asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19872)|
| 5:31:14| Thank you for the recommendations, doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19874)|

| 5:31:21| And like you guys want, we want to live in a Knoxville, Tennessee area like we have before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19881)|
| 5:31:27| with a place of honor, that we honor one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19887)|
| 5:31:32| And that is where the division's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19892)|
| 5:31:34| And I know that we've heard that all night, that there's this anger and this discord and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19894)|
| 5:31:41| strife, and basically, all we're asking is, we've got to take the power from the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19901)|

| 5:31:54| We can sit around a table and have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19914)|
| 5:31:58| You can wear a mask, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19918)|
| 5:32:01| You're not wearing a mask, that's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19921)|
| 5:32:04| But it's these decisions that are at, that are in danger, our own decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19924)|
| 5:32:11| And I'm telling you, the reason why there's such a divide is because the public is constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19931)|
| 5:32:16| hearing two different opinions thrown at us all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19936)|
| 5:32:22| And that has caused such a mass confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19942)|
| 5:32:25| I love this quote, the Amish were asked, why hasn't COVID really affected their community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19945)|
| 5:32:32| And they said, because we don't have a television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19952)|
| 5:32:35| So somebody said in here, there's got to be a cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19955)|
| 5:32:38| And I'm not trying to be funny, but seriously, turn the TV off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19958)|
| 5:32:43| And I just say that to anybody listening, turn your media off, live your life, spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19963)|
| 5:32:49| time with your family, turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19969)|
| 5:32:53| Because that thing going on 24 seven in people's houses, is what keeps the fear intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19973)|
| 5:32:59| And that is what we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19979)|
| 5:33:01| Yes, the virus is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19981)|
| 5:33:02| But it's fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19982)|
| 5:33:04| When you agree with fear, you open the door to the enemy in your life, whether it's through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19984)|
| 5:33:12| depression, whatever it is, you're opening that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=19992)|

| 5:35:01| When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20101)|
| 5:35:07| So he went in and reclined at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20107)|
| 5:35:10| But the Pharisees, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, were surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20110)|
| 5:35:16| Then the Lord said to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20116)|
| 5:35:18| Now then, you Pharisees clean up the outside of the cup and dish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20118)|
| 5:35:23| but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20123)|

| 5:35:29| Do not, sorry, it's really hard to see up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20129)|

| 5:35:37| but give what is inside the dish to the poor and everything will be clean for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20137)|
| 5:35:41| Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20141)|
| 5:35:47| but you neglect justice and the love of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20147)|
| 5:35:50| You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20150)|
| 5:35:55| Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20155)|
| 5:36:01| Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20161)|
| 5:36:06| One of the experts in the law answered him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20166)|
| 5:36:09| Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20169)|
| 5:36:13| Jesus replied, and you experts in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20173)|
| 5:36:16| woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20176)|

| 5:36:43| Now listen, you say today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20203)|
| 5:36:48| spend a year there, carry on business and make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20208)|
| 5:36:51| Why? You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20211)|
| 5:36:54| What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20214)|

| 5:38:22| Lord willing, I'll have the right words to say because I honestly didn't plan anything in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20302)|
| 5:38:27| I was just planning on speaking from my heart and from personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20307)|
| 5:38:33| And thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20313)|
| 5:38:37| Before the meeting or during a recess, we got to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20317)|
| 5:38:41| and she informed me that something I was going to speak on was inaccurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20321)|
| 5:38:46| because I was blaming the Board of Health for not being able to work out at the gym that I pay, that I'm a member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20326)|
| 5:38:54| I'm at my highest weight ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20334)|
| 5:38:57| I feel that I'm at a greater risk because of COVID if I were to get infected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20337)|
| 5:39:05| But she politely informed me that it is not the Board of Health's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20345)|
| 5:39:11| I guess I can blame those business owners for not staying open 24 hours because I don't feel that it's a good idea to sacrifice my safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20351)|
| 5:39:21| for my health by going for a jog at 3 a.m. in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20361)|
| 5:39:26| Sorry, I'm a little bit emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20366)|
| 5:39:29| My anxiety is a little high because when I was speaking to her here at the last recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20369)|
| 5:39:35| I got verbally attacked by this woman who told me she was uncomfortable because my mask was below my nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20375)|
| 5:39:43| I did have it over my mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20383)|
| 5:39:45| But she was, like, verbally attacking me because I was conversing with Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20385)|
| 5:39:52| That's not the type of behavior we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20392)|
| 5:39:55| People need to be kind to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20395)|
| 5:39:58| On the Internet, I've been bullied by these people who feel that masks should be the law and that everyone should wear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20398)|
| 5:40:07| Even if you have exemptions, people don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20407)|
| 5:40:11| People are just so mean and so rude and so thoughtless and careless of other people's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20411)|
| 5:40:20| Even some of these doctors that spoke here earlier, you know, they said some convincing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20420)|
| 5:40:29| But when you think about it, you know, they say, oh, our doctors aren't getting infected here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20429)|
| 5:40:37| Well, you can't say it's because of the mask mandates because they're checking everyone's temperature with a thermometer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20437)|
| 5:40:45| Right when you walk in the office, we know if you have a fever, you're going to shed viruses more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20445)|
| 5:40:51| more so than if you don't have a fever when you have an infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20451)|
| 5:40:56| So that's that's not a scientific fact that they're up here speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20456)|
| 5:41:02| We can't treat these doctors like they're gods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20462)|
| 5:41:06| There's medical malpractice that happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20466)|
| 5:41:09| There's people who get misdiagnosed and get given medications that cause diseases in their bodies and all sorts of horrible things because of human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20469)|
| 5:41:21| You know, with the science is as go back to elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20481)|
| 5:41:26| You've got hypothesis and you have theory and then you have facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20486)|
| 5:41:31| Now, if all of this stuff that these doctors are saying was fact, there would not be so many contradictory studies done on these topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20491)|
| 5:41:42| You know, when we make laws, we want to make it based on fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20502)|
| 5:41:46| That's why we have a Supreme Court so they can separate the fact from fiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20506)|
| 5:41:53| You know, you're not a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20513)|
| 5:41:56| Judges on this committee, but you're in a power or a position of authority to where you can discern the truth from opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20516)|
| 5:42:07| And it's either fact or opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20527)|
| 5:42:11| It's either hypothesis, theory or fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20531)|
| 5:42:16| We can't be making laws based on theories, based on hypothesis that are unproven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20536)|
| 5:42:24| Also, I noticed, and also those doctors, one of those doctors that was up here, I quit doing business with them because we have that right to get a second opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20544)|
| 5:42:40| We didn't ask for this Board of Health to be making decisions on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20560)|
| 5:42:45| Who are we to go to for a second opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20565)|
| 5:42:48| We have the right to informed consent when it comes to medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20568)|
| 5:42:53| Why is our informed consent taken away with in consideration to the Board of Health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20573)|
| 5:42:59| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20579)|
| 5:43:02| And that same doctor's office, a doctor in that office told me not to wear a mask because of my allergies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20582)|
| 5:43:10| And I'm like, what? Allergies, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20590)|
| 5:43:12| He said, yeah, you don't get the same airflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20592)|
| 5:43:15| But yet a doctor from that same office is coming up here praising mask wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20595)|
| 5:43:21| And also I noticed this week that there may have been more parties on UT campus because the bars closed early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20601)|
| 5:43:30| And as a female, even men can be vulnerable to this, but there's a stigma where men don't realize that they can be victimized, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20610)|
| 5:43:38| I'm finishing up. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20618)|
| 5:43:40| So sorry to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20620)|
| 5:43:43| Women are put at a greater risk at these private parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20623)|
| 5:43:49| It's not right that these bars are being closed down because if people are going to drink, they're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20629)|
| 5:43:55| And it's safer for people to be in a public place where they cannot be taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20635)|
| 5:44:01| And we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20641)|
| 5:44:04| Thank you very much. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20644)|
| 5:44:08| Mr. Tom Windham. Are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20648)|
| 5:44:11| Mr. Tom Windham, please make yourself known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20651)|
| 5:44:15| Last call. Dr. Steve Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20655)|
| 5:44:27| Please state your name and address for the record. You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20667)|
| 5:44:30| I am a Knox County resident. My name is Steve Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20670)|
| 5:44:33| I live at 2734 Arbor Place, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20673)|
| 5:44:38| I have a quick question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20678)|
| 5:44:41| You speak like five times, can you get a T-shirt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20681)|
| 5:44:45| This will be my fifth time, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20685)|
| 5:44:48| I thought that originally we would, since public forum was at the beginning of the meeting, that I would speak then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20688)|
| 5:44:54| So all of my remarks pretty much have gone by the wayside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20694)|
| 5:44:57| So I'm going to wing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20697)|
| 5:45:00| In addition to all the organizations that Chairman Jay mentioned, there's some he didn't mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20700)|
| 5:45:07| There's the County Technical Assistance Service from the University of Tennessee right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20707)|
| 5:45:15| Market Square, Knox County, I'm sorry, Knoxville Chamber Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20715)|
| 5:45:21| There's the Howard Baker Center. All of those are resources that Knox County can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20721)|
| 5:45:27| And guess what? Every one of them is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20727)|
| 5:45:31| With respect, Mayor Daley, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20731)|
| 5:45:36| Yes, sir, it is your responsibility to find out every piece of information you can find so that you can make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20736)|
| 5:45:45| Not going to those other organizations is not an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20745)|
| 5:45:51| Respectfully, Commissioner Smith, when Knox County created the Knox County Board of Health based on the Tennessee statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20751)|
| 5:46:00| it gave it the power to impose and promulgate regulations stronger than the State of Tennessee Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20760)|
| 5:46:15| All regulatory boards make policy by definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20775)|
| 5:46:20| I have sat in your shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20780)|
| 5:46:23| I have made policy that impacted every citizen of this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20783)|
| 5:46:29| That's what regulatory boards do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20789)|
| 5:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20792)|
| 5:46:34| A few comments about the regulation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20794)|
| 5:46:38| Last week, Commissioner Ward mentioned that he wanted to be thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20798)|
| 5:46:47| And he mentioned that when he was in the Air Force, he worked in the Air Force Intelligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20807)|
| 5:46:52| Correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20812)|
| 5:46:56| And by doing so, you did an honorable and vital service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20816)|
| 5:47:01| You mentioned that what you tried to do was find the truth so that you can impart that to ground troops and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20821)|
| 5:47:09| The truth is not what you were after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20829)|
| 5:47:12| The truth is a philosophical construct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20832)|
| 5:47:14| It's about right and wrong, ethical, unethical, moral, and immoral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20834)|
| 5:47:19| What you were after was facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20839)|
| 5:47:22| I was trained as a combat officer during wartime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20842)|
| 5:47:25| I didn't care a flip about truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20845)|
| 5:47:27| I cared everything about fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20847)|
| 5:47:31| Last week when you were talking about the purpose of the advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20851)|
| 5:47:41| you said that it was to provide, and you talked about it again tonight, more opinions, more information to Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20861)|
| 5:47:53| I'm sure Mayor Jacobs is interested in having more people advise him when he has surrounded himself either by his own choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20873)|
| 5:48:00| or by keeping those from Mayor Burchett on his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20880)|
| 5:48:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20886)|
| 5:48:08| I have seen a ton of American government books, and without exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20888)|
| 5:48:16| all of them tell three things that are the greatest three criticisms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20896)|
| 5:48:23| You're inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20903)|
| 5:48:26| It's inefficient, not referring to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20906)|
| 5:48:28| It's ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20908)|
| 5:48:29| You don't do what you say, and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20909)|
| 5:48:32| You do a lot of unnecessary things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20912)|
| 5:48:37| And this new advisory board, in my learned opinion, is just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20917)|
| 5:48:42| something that's unnecessary when we are completely surrounded with lots and lots of resources that remain untapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20922)|
| 5:48:52| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20932)|
| 5:48:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20934)|
| 5:48:55| Andrew Flores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20935)|
| 5:49:02| Andrew Flores, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20942)|
| 5:49:05| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20945)|
| 5:49:06| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20946)|
| 5:49:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20952)|
| 5:49:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20958)|
| 5:49:22| Mr. Law Director, I want to ask you a question about something that was just brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20962)|
| 5:49:28| I look at the ordinance in which we created our Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20968)|
| 5:49:32| It's a simple ordinance that's A and B and says nothing about powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20972)|
| 5:49:39| And then I go to the state statute, 68-2-601, and read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20979)|
| 5:49:49| All these other six counties are operating under this state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20989)|
| 5:49:54| Our ordinance is simply creating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20994)|
| 5:49:59| Why are the other five counties not operating the way we are if we are all under the same statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=20999)|
| 5:50:07| That is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21007)|
| 5:50:09| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21009)|
| 5:50:11| And when Commissioner Biggs and I were meeting with Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21011)|
| 5:50:16| she threw in another little thing that Memphis-Shelby County didn't even have a Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21016)|
| 5:50:22| and they were looking to do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21022)|
| 5:50:25| Well, we're following the law which says that the medical director must follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21025)|
| 5:50:33| and execute the policies as drafted by the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21033)|
| 5:50:37| That's what the law reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21037)|
| 5:50:39| Why these other counties aren't doing it, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21039)|
| 5:50:42| It's an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21042)|
| 5:50:44| Without the Board of Health, Dr. Buchanan has all of those powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21044)|
| 5:50:48| They're there by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21048)|
| 5:50:50| So if there's no Board of Health, she has absolute power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21050)|
| 5:50:54| And so if you get rid of the Board of Health, it's going to be like the other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21054)|
| 5:50:59| She's going to be doing it, and the governor said in the six counties, of which we're one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21059)|
| 5:51:05| the health director, that's what he says, the health department, the health director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21065)|
| 5:51:10| can impose regulations more stringent than the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21070)|
| 5:51:15| So Dr. Buchanan has those powers with or without the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21075)|
| 5:51:19| The thing is that our county, and I guess based upon law director advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21079)|
| 5:51:23| is we're following the strict lines of the law which says that the Board of Health makes policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21083)|
| 5:51:29| and the health director must carry it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21089)|
| 5:51:39| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21099)|
| 5:51:42| Mr. Flores, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21102)|
| 5:51:44| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21104)|
| 5:51:45| It's Andrew Flores, 1011 Lancewood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21105)|
| 5:51:53| It has been my pleasure to speak with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21113)|
| 5:51:55| This will be the fourth or fifth time I've stood up and spoken and exercised my privilege and my right to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21115)|
| 5:52:02| And I have been encouraged by hearing the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21122)|
| 5:52:05| and by getting to hear from some of you individually what your personal stances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21125)|
| 5:52:10| So you don't just have to hear mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21130)|
| 5:52:12| I actually get to hear yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21132)|
| 5:52:14| That's part of being in community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21134)|
| 5:52:17| If Martha Buchanan is still here, I wanted to say thank you to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21137)|
| 5:52:20| She's been running the health department for any number of years, decades maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21140)|
| 5:52:25| I'm not exactly sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21145)|
| 5:52:26| We really didn't know much about her until after she kind of came into the light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21146)|
| 5:52:30| and the Board of Health came up and there was a pandemic and she had to start dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21150)|
| 5:52:40| So her team, her and her team have been under, I'm going to call it constant assault by different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21160)|
| 5:52:46| as they're trying to enforce what the Board of Health has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21166)|
| 5:52:49| So Martha, thank you and thank you to your team for doing what you're tasked with doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21169)|
| 5:52:55| which is a hard job, especially when you have a division like we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21175)|
| 5:52:59| That's a difficult thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21179)|
| 5:53:01| And so I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21181)|
| 5:53:05| When the Board of Health was created in the state law, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21185)|
| 5:53:09| that gave it its power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21189)|
| 5:53:11| And then, of course, Knox County adopting that or writing an ordinance for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21191)|
| 5:53:15| or whatever it is that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21195)|
| 5:53:17| We actually created an anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21197)|
| 5:53:21| We created a redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21201)|
| 5:53:23| They have executive power or they have power to create law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21203)|
| 5:53:27| but you guys have the power to create law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21207)|
| 5:53:30| They have power to create mandates, but you have the power to create mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21210)|
| 5:53:35| I think it was Commissioner Jay who said in the last meeting, in this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21215)|
| 5:53:39| about Commissioner Ward's committees, it seems to be a bit of redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21219)|
| 5:53:44| And I'm seeing that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21224)|
| 5:53:46| It's a bit of redundancy in having two legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21226)|
| 5:53:52| one that is unchecked and one that is in check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21232)|
| 5:53:59| I think Commissioner Hill, in one of the meetings prior to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21239)|
| 5:54:02| maybe three meetings ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21242)|
| 5:54:04| you mentioned something about the Knox County keeping its autonomy from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21244)|
| 5:54:12| And I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21252)|
| 5:54:14| But when I look at the situation, I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21254)|
| 5:54:16| the Board of Health actually has autonomy from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21256)|
| 5:54:20| They're the ones who we have no recourse against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21260)|
| 5:54:25| They're the ones who are separate from us, who make mandates for us or make rules for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21265)|
| 5:54:32| So we don't necessarily have autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21272)|
| 5:54:35| They have autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21275)|
| 5:54:37| And we have no defense against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21277)|
| 5:54:40| I don't think that the medical professionals are any less professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21280)|
| 5:54:44| I think that they are highly qualified individuals sitting on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21284)|
| 5:54:48| And I think that's to their credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21288)|
| 5:54:51| I don't believe that they should have that executive power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21291)|
| 5:54:54| I believe that's yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21294)|
| 5:54:56| That's what you guys should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21296)|
| 5:54:58| I also understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21298)|
| 5:55:00| Maybe we've waited too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21300)|
| 5:55:02| We've kind of danced around the idea of dissolving the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21302)|
| 5:55:06| And maybe we could have done it a few months ago with less uproar about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21306)|
| 5:55:14| And, you know, I guess if we waited too long, we've waited too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21314)|
| 5:55:19| And we're going to have to just kind of see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21319)|
| 5:55:22| I do think that it's a smart idea to create a committee that Dr. Buchanan can feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21322)|
| 5:55:30| I think that, you know, at some point the Board of Health will be dissolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21330)|
| 5:55:33| They're either going to be dissolved by the state or they're going to be dissolved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21333)|
| 5:55:38| And if Dr. Buchanan is going to end up with that power, then she needs every available resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21338)|
| 5:55:44| every piece of equipment and tool that she can get her hands on to help advise her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21344)|
| 5:55:49| and to help give advice to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21349)|
| 5:55:51| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21351)|
| 5:55:53| I know it's 1130 at night, and we're in this together trying to sort through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21353)|
| 5:55:58| I appreciate your comments tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21358)|
| 5:56:00| And, you know, I look forward to seeing what we can find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21360)|
| 5:56:04| Maybe there is a middle ground or a common ground that we can actually find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21364)|
| 5:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21367)|
| 5:56:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21368)|
| 5:56:09| Elizabeth Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21369)|
| 5:56:11| Murphy, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21371)|
| 5:56:15| Yes, I am a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21375)|
| 5:56:17| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21377)|
| 5:56:19| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21379)|
| 5:56:20| Elizabeth Murphy, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21380)|
| 5:56:22| I'm in Carson Daly's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21382)|
| 5:56:23| I wanted to get a little bit closer since I'm not a fan of speaking up in the dark anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21383)|
| 5:56:27| I don't have anything planned to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21387)|
| 5:56:29| I didn't actually think I'd still be here this late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21389)|
| 5:56:31| But what Bussler said really hit home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21391)|
| 5:56:34| How do we all come together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21394)|
| 5:56:35| How do we find middle ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21395)|
| 5:56:36| We keep showing up every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21396)|
| 5:56:38| You don't want to see us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21398)|
| 5:56:39| We don't want to be here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21399)|
| 5:56:41| We feel bad to keep you all late, but that is your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21401)|
| 5:56:43| So here is my idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21403)|
| 5:56:45| Most of us want answers from Dr. Buchanan and the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21405)|
| 5:56:48| We want to know what the metrics are for ending the mask mandate and the curfew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21408)|
| 5:56:52| and we want to know where their powers stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21412)|
| 5:56:55| A lot of us are worried about the coming COVID vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21415)|
| 5:56:58| Where is the data that she needs to stop the mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21418)|
| 5:57:04| or is she going to wait until there's a vaccine available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21424)|
| 5:57:07| That's what we want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21427)|
| 5:57:08| The Board of Health takes our Zoom meetings, and we have our public forum time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21428)|
| 5:57:13| but they don't actually engage with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21433)|
| 5:57:15| At least you all engage with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21435)|
| 5:57:16| You answer our emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21436)|
| 5:57:17| You answer our calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21437)|
| 5:57:18| I know that Bussler has met with some of his constituents as recently as Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21438)|
| 5:57:22| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21442)|
| 5:57:24| But the Board of Health, they are not elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21444)|
| 5:57:26| They don't care what us in Knox County do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21446)|
| 5:57:30| They don't even care what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21450)|
| 5:57:32| You pass a resolution, and they thumb their nose at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21452)|
| 5:57:35| They did nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21455)|
| 5:57:36| They're out of control, but you all know that, so I'm not going to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21456)|
| 5:57:38| So how do we fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21458)|
| 5:57:39| How do we bridge the gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21459)|
| 5:57:41| The only way I see to bridge the gap is more information, more conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21461)|
| 5:57:45| So how do we have a time where we can talk to Dr. Buchanan and the rest of the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21465)|
| 5:57:49| but at least Dr. Buchanan, and say, what are your metrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21469)|
| 5:57:52| and will you mandate a COVID vaccine when it's released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21472)|
| 5:57:55| Because there have been things said in Board of Health meetings that have really scared many of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21475)|
| 5:58:00| I don't want to go into quoting right now because I know I'll get the quote wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21480)|
| 5:58:03| but that's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21483)|
| 5:58:04| I think that's what most of us want, just a time where we can talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21484)|
| 5:58:07| and where they can actually answer us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21487)|
| 5:58:09| So if there's a way to get that set up, I would love to have that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21489)|
| 5:58:12| I would love to see you show up again, if we can just get some questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21492)|
| 5:58:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21495)|
| 5:58:23| Kevin, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21503)|
| 5:58:27| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21507)|
| 5:58:29| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21509)|
| 5:58:32| Kevin Hill, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21512)|
| 5:58:35| So, Carson, I really appreciate the pickle you feel like you're in and what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21515)|
| 5:58:44| And, you know, you don't want to dissolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21524)|
| 5:58:47| You want an advisory body, but you really want to see them tone it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21527)|
| 5:58:51| Well, you've already asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21531)|
| 5:58:53| This body has already asked that of that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21533)|
| 5:58:56| And as Elizabeth said, they thumbed their nose at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21536)|
| 5:59:00| They showed no respect for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21540)|
| 5:59:04| In the last meeting, it was obvious that they were basically like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21544)|
| 5:59:10| what do we do about this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21550)|
| 5:59:12| And it was just kind of like, well, it's going to be a two-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21552)|
| 5:59:15| So their concern for your ability to exercise oversight for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21555)|
| 5:59:22| they've already bought into, you're a paper tiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21562)|
| 5:59:29| So I appreciate that you would like for them to rein themselves back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21569)|
| 5:59:34| They've told you we're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21574)|
| 5:59:37| What's the old saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21577)|
| 5:59:39| Power corrupts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21579)|
| 5:59:41| Absolute power corrupts absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21581)|
| 5:59:44| These people have absolute power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21584)|
| 5:59:46| You think they're putting the genie back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21586)|
| 5:59:48| Why do we have these idioms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21588)|
| 5:59:50| Or why do we have these phrases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21590)|
| 5:59:52| Because they're true almost all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21592)|
| 5:59:55| You don't put the genie back in the bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21595)|
| 5:59:59| What freedoms you give to government, you never get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21599)|
| 6:00:03| These are classic idioms in our cultural vernacular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21603)|
| 6:00:07| because they always pan out to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21607)|
| 6:00:11| So you're not going to get to have a Board of Health that's reined in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21611)|
| 6:00:15| and doesn't issue violations of constitutional authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21615)|
| 6:00:20| We've already heard it's fully within their power to regulate firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21620)|
| 6:00:26| And it is because the tortured logic of all the abuse of constitutional powers that goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21626)|
| 6:00:32| and it may finally in the law, in a courtroom, in three years get sorted out and taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21632)|
| 6:00:39| But why should we have to wait for three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21639)|
| 6:00:42| Because that's how long these cases take to get to the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21642)|
| 6:00:46| So why should people suffer under that ambiguity for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21646)|
| 6:00:49| when you can do something really simple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21649)|
| 6:00:53| And you can institute the sister companion entity that is in the TCA already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21653)|
| 6:01:00| That's an advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21660)|
| 6:01:03| It's right after. You're reading through the Tennessee code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21663)|
| 6:01:08| Right underneath Board of Health is advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21668)|
| 6:01:11| And the great thing about an advisory committee in that law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21671)|
| 6:01:14| is it doesn't straitjacket you on who it is and who gets it and what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21674)|
| 6:01:18| You have total freedom to design for yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21678)|
| 6:01:21| something similar to what Commissioner Ward has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21681)|
| 6:01:24| but it is exclusively focused on health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21684)|
| 6:01:27| And that allows you to have mental health, alternative health practitioners, nutritionists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21687)|
| 6:01:33| Maybe we might actually have someone, we might actually have an advisory body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21693)|
| 6:01:37| that's telling people good advice on things you can do to help make your body stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21697)|
| 6:01:43| Because we've not heard squat from these experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21703)|
| 6:01:47| And before I run out of time, the old idiom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21707)|
| 6:01:50| Remember those idioms are gold. Follow the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21710)|
| 6:01:53| Do you know how much money, and I know this for a fact, but I can't divulge the source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21713)|
| 6:01:57| but it's a solid source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21717)|
| 6:02:00| Do you know how much money UT has made off of COVID in the last three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21720)|
| 6:02:03| Not the last nine months, the last three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21723)|
| 6:02:06| Off of their billing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21726)|
| 6:02:08| So there's another dollar amount we're going to talk about after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21728)|
| 6:02:11| Off of their billing services that are 120% up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21731)|
| 6:02:14| they've made over $40 million off of COVID, UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21734)|
| 6:02:19| You know what else they've made a ton of money off of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21739)|
| 6:02:22| In addition to those billing services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21742)|
| 6:02:27| they get $166,000 per admittance to the hospital out of the CARES Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21747)|
| 6:02:35| They've gotten $34 million since this all began out of the CARES Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21755)|
| 6:02:39| So UT Hospital can cry all they want about how hard it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21759)|
| 6:02:42| They've got a $70 million profit margin out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21762)|
| 6:02:47| And now we have a board that's comprised, one of them is a senior official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21767)|
| 6:02:52| We have a board that's comprised of mostly UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21772)|
| 6:02:55| We don't have a Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21775)|
| 6:02:57| We have a University of Tennessee Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21777)|
| 6:03:00| And they're making decisions, and I get it, they themselves aren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21780)|
| 6:03:05| they're in a torture chamber, echo chamber of logic where, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21785)|
| 6:03:10| I can tell you, I know doctors that work at UT that have been threatened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21790)|
| 6:03:13| they'd be fired if they questioned what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21793)|
| 6:03:16| So there are administrative and political powers at play that like the cash cow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21796)|
| 6:03:21| We've already heard from our governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21801)|
| 6:03:23| We don't even have to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21803)|
| 6:03:25| So we know it's rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21805)|
| 6:03:27| The governor said, I'm extending emergency orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21807)|
| 6:03:29| because I want Tennessee to get its share of the cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21809)|
| 6:03:33| This is all about getting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21813)|
| 6:03:35| And whose pockets it's coming out of, yours and mine as federal taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21815)|
| 6:03:39| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21819)|
| 6:03:40| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21820)|
| 6:03:42| Christine Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21822)|
| 6:03:45| Cruz, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21825)|
| 6:03:47| I'm your neighbor, Mr. Larson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21827)|
| 6:03:49| Are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21829)|
| 6:03:51| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21831)|
| 6:03:52| I live at 1921 Lyons Bend Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21832)|
| 6:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21835)|
| 6:03:56| Please, well, you already stated your name and address to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21836)|
| 6:03:59| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21839)|
| 6:04:01| I just stated my address, but my name is Christine Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21841)|
| 6:04:05| James Freeman Clark once said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21845)|
| 6:04:07| a politician thinks of the next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21847)|
| 6:04:10| a statesman of the next generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21850)|
| 6:04:13| A politician looks for the success of his party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21853)|
| 6:04:16| a statesman for that of his country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21856)|
| 6:04:20| The statesman wishes to steer while the politician is satisfied to drift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21860)|
| 6:04:27| I would like to thank everybody here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21867)|
| 6:04:30| for coming to support this very important cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21870)|
| 6:04:33| as we watch our inalienable rights being stripped away by the Knoxville County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21873)|
| 6:04:38| Where is the statesman among us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21878)|
| 6:04:41| I see a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21881)|
| 6:04:44| Some from who I didn't expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21884)|
| 6:04:47| And I love to be surprised like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21887)|
| 6:04:51| Calling this time of crisis as a time to delay the correct constitutional decision is disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21891)|
| 6:05:00| It is what a politician does, not a statesman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21900)|
| 6:05:04| This crisis will never be allowed to end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21904)|
| 6:05:07| as it will be forced vaccines, forced health cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21907)|
| 6:05:09| so you are deemed safe to travel among society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21909)|
| 6:05:13| Then it will be the attack on the Second Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21913)|
| 6:05:15| disguised as a mental health public emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21915)|
| 6:05:19| Your condescending, Mr. Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21919)|
| 6:05:22| about those of us who oppose the constitutional infringements on our privacy and due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21922)|
| 6:05:27| that would be First and Fourth Amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21927)|
| 6:05:31| are quite unprofessional and childish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21931)|
| 6:05:34| We are here to ask you to make the right decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21934)|
| 6:05:37| instead of kicking the can to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21937)|
| 6:05:40| Because you need to take responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21940)|
| 6:05:43| for your actions in appointing this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21943)|
| 6:05:46| You should be responsible for dissolving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21946)|
| 6:05:49| Weren't you the person who claimed to take responsibility for your own actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21949)|
| 6:05:53| Just clarifying for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21953)|
| 6:05:56| So we will go over your heads to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21956)|
| 6:05:59| and you will be held accountable for your refusal to act in a constitutional manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21959)|
| 6:06:04| President Trump even clarified in a White House press conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21964)|
| 6:06:07| that Drs. Fauci and Birx were an advisory group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21967)|
| 6:06:11| and not an enforcement one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21971)|
| 6:06:14| I speak for myself and many people here when we are asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21974)|
| 6:06:18| and I think there's a very large miscommunication going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21978)|
| 6:06:22| Nobody wants the Knox County Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21982)|
| 6:06:27| to be completely obliterated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21987)|
| 6:06:30| We want them to be put into an advisory position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21990)|
| 6:06:34| because the elected officials cannot regulate them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21994)|
| 6:06:38| as Commissioner Durrett clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=21998)|
| 6:06:42| So their powers exceed those of the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22002)|
| 6:06:47| So that's all we ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22007)|
| 6:06:51| There was a news story on Channel 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22011)|
| 6:06:54| that stated that Governor Lee was being pressured by the White House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22014)|
| 6:06:57| to reinstitute a statewide mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22017)|
| 6:07:00| but that's a misleading story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22020)|
| 6:07:03| as the order came from the White House task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22023)|
| 6:07:07| which is led by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22027)|
| 6:07:10| It didn't come from President Trump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22030)|
| 6:07:12| So there's the press manipulating once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22032)|
| 6:07:16| and it's not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22036)|
| 6:07:18| So we need to do our own homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22038)|
| 6:07:20| and we're all responsible to do our own homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22040)|
| 6:07:22| Dissolving the Board of Health does not invalidate their role as an advisory group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22042)|
| 6:07:26| but they do not know our personal stories that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22046)|
| 6:07:30| I was compelled by your story, Commissioner Lundy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22050)|
| 6:07:34| and yours as well, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22054)|
| 6:07:38| Time is our most precious commodity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22058)|
| 6:07:40| as I know as a health care provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22060)|
| 6:07:44| and as Commissioner Bussler stated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22064)|
| 6:07:47| With billions of dollars of assets that Steve Jobs had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22067)|
| 6:07:50| he could not use it to buy one more day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22070)|
| 6:07:54| I hear the passion in everyone's stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22074)|
| 6:07:56| This is not about the validity of the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22076)|
| 6:07:59| This is about the mask mandate being the vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22079)|
| 6:08:02| to allow government to take subsequent rights away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22082)|
| 6:08:05| in an escalating manner, as stated above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22085)|
| 6:08:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22088)|
| 6:08:13| Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22093)|
| 6:08:15| I'm right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22095)|
| 6:08:16| Are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22096)|
| 6:08:17| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22097)|
| 6:08:18| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22098)|
| 6:08:20| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22100)|
| 6:08:21| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22101)|
| 6:08:22| I live at 7900 Sharp Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22102)|
| 6:08:27| I didn't prepare a speech tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22107)|
| 6:08:28| so I probably won't even take up the whole five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22108)|
| 6:08:30| because there's a couple of things I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22110)|
| 6:08:33| First off, Dr. Williams came and spoke very eloquently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22113)|
| 6:08:36| about the UT Hospital and how there are patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22116)|
| 6:08:39| that are being crowded in the hallways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22119)|
| 6:08:41| Well, I worked at a hospital for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22121)|
| 6:08:44| At certain times of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22124)|
| 6:08:45| there are always patients lining up the hallways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22125)|
| 6:08:49| patients that have to wait until there's room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22129)|
| 6:08:51| in the hospital to be admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22131)|
| 6:08:53| That happens frequently, and it happens every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22133)|
| 6:08:58| And another, Susan, I do not remember her name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22138)|
| 6:09:01| but spoke very eloquently about things such as seatbelts, smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22141)|
| 6:09:08| Those are all laws that were legislated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22148)|
| 6:09:10| and went through legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22150)|
| 6:09:11| and went through the proper process to become law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22151)|
| 6:09:16| not mask mandates, not bar curfews, not closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22156)|
| 6:09:21| None of that has gone through any process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22161)|
| 6:09:24| other than the Board of Health saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22164)|
| 6:09:26| this is what it is, this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22166)|
| 6:09:28| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22168)|
| 6:09:31| Another thing I wanted to clarify was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22171)|
| 6:09:33| there seems to be a lot of miscommunication in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22173)|
| 6:09:37| about what we are asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22177)|
| 6:09:39| We are not asking for the health department to be dissolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22179)|
| 6:09:43| The health department is always going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22183)|
| 6:09:47| We are not asking for anything to happen with Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22187)|
| 6:09:51| She will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22191)|
| 6:09:52| A lot of people seem to have confusion as to what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22192)|
| 6:09:56| The Board of Health is a completely separate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22196)|
| 6:09:59| But the only thing that matters here is the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22199)|
| 6:10:04| and the fact that the existence of the Board of Health is unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22204)|
| 6:10:10| And as our commissioners, you took an oath to uphold the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22210)|
| 6:10:15| and it is your responsibility to take care of this matter as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22215)|
| 6:10:21| We can't afford to wait until the pandemic is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22221)|
| 6:10:25| because our rights are continually being stripped away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22225)|
| 6:10:27| And as it was mentioned before, what's going to happen next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22227)|
| 6:10:30| They already spoke at the last meeting about targeted closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22230)|
| 6:10:36| limiting more gathering sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22236)|
| 6:10:39| Cases are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22239)|
| 6:10:41| And my point is, positive tests do not equal a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22241)|
| 6:10:46| A symptom equals a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22246)|
| 6:10:50| But to my point, if masks were really working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22250)|
| 6:10:57| why are the numbers going up so high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22257)|
| 6:11:01| We've been in a mask mandate since July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22261)|
| 6:11:05| and yet the numbers have continually risen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22265)|
| 6:11:09| Positive tests, though, not cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22269)|
| 6:11:14| But the only thing that matters is the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22274)|
| 6:11:16| and it is your constitutional responsibility to take care of this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22276)|
| 6:11:20| at the earliest time possible, which is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22280)|
| 6:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22285)|
| 6:11:26| Peter Easton, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22286)|
| 6:11:37| Mr. Easton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22297)|
| 6:11:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22300)|
| 6:11:42| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22302)|
| 6:11:43| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22303)|
| 6:11:45| My name is Peter Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22305)|
| 6:11:48| I live at 6901 Ivy Stone Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22308)|
| 6:11:53| Last month I submitted a request to my commissioner, Charlie Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22313)|
| 6:12:01| and he helped teach me a little bit about learning how to address our local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22321)|
| 6:12:08| And I'm grateful to Charlie for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22328)|
| 6:12:12| He's still a good teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22332)|
| 6:12:15| I submitted that request early the day after Labor Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22335)|
| 6:12:20| and then later on in the month of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22340)|
| 6:12:24| I had my attorney type up a formal request for a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22344)|
| 6:12:31| that would call for an ordinance dissolving the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22351)|
| 6:12:38| I'm going to read from part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22358)|
| 6:12:40| Whereas this system of government, consisting of a legislative department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22360)|
| 6:12:46| an executive department, and a judicial department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22366)|
| 6:12:50| existed in the state of Tennessee before its Constitution of 1870| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22370)|
| 6:12:56| and was reaffirmed in the Tennessee Constitution of 1870,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22376)|
| 6:13:01| as explained in Article 2, Sections 1 and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22381)|
| 6:13:06| which state the distribution of powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22386)|
| 6:13:09| Whereas the separation of powers doctrine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22389)|
| 6:13:12| essential to our form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22392)|
| 6:13:15| declares that only the legislative branch shall make laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22395)|
| 6:13:20| you being the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22400)|
| 6:13:23| and that only in its discretion to say what the law shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22403)|
| 6:13:27| and the executive branch shall enforce only the laws duly enacted by the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22407)|
| 6:13:35| That would be Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22415)|
| 6:13:38| Whereas Knox County also adopted this form of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22418)|
| 6:13:42| and the Knox County Charter states in Article 2, Section 2.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22422)|
| 6:13:49| the legislative power of the county is vested in the commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22429)|
| 6:13:59| which is the legislative branch and body of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22439)|
| 6:14:06| Whereas the only exceptions to the endowment of legislative power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22446)|
| 6:14:11| to the county commission with respect to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22451)|
| 6:14:14| are stated in Section 2.02 as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22454)|
| 6:14:19| The commission shall not exercise the powers of the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22459)|
| 6:14:23| judicial branch, board of education, and elected charter and constitutional officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22463)|
| 6:14:30| as defined by the Constitution of this state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22470)|
| 6:14:36| Whereas the Knox County Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22476)|
| 6:14:39| established by ordinance number 0-96-3-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22479)|
| 6:14:47| subsection V as in Victor, parentheses Bravo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22487)|
| 6:14:52| on April 22, 1996,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22492)|
| 6:14:57| but empowered via the TCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22497)|
| 6:15:01| subsection 68-2-601 as sequential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22501)|
| 6:15:08| does not fall under any of the aforementioned exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22508)|
| 6:15:13| as is neither an office established by the Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22513)|
| 6:15:19| nor composed of elected officials established by the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22519)|
| 6:15:25| nor established under Knox County Charter as part of the Knox County executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22525)|
| 6:15:32| judicial branch, nor the board of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22532)|
| 6:15:37| Whereas the Knox County Board of Health is not answerable to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22537)|
| 6:15:44| or its elected officials contrary to our national traditions of a representative republic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22544)|
| 6:15:52| and the extent of the power afforded to the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22552)|
| 6:15:57| via TCA 68-2-601, parentheses F, parentheses 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22557)|
| 6:16:09| was not realized or tested before the COVID-19 crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22569)|
| 6:16:15| Until that crisis, that's when we found out what was written in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22575)|
| 6:16:20| Whereas the Knox County Board of Health, rather than the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22580)|
| 6:16:25| has exercised the legislative prerogative of determining what the law shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22585)|
| 6:16:33| with respect to Knox County public policy response to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22593)|
| 6:16:39| That should have been your department, not theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22599)|
| 6:16:43| That's why there's an open, festering wound here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22603)|
| 6:16:48| And until that situation is fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22608)|
| 6:16:54| in other words, the only way to fix it and dissolve the mandates is to dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22614)|
| 6:17:00| Thank you, Mr. Eason. Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22620)|
| 6:17:04| The last person to speak in our public forum will be Mr. Glenn Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22624)|
| 6:17:08| Mr. Glenn Stafford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22628)|
| 6:17:12| Are you a Knox County resident, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22632)|
| 6:17:16| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22636)|

| 6:17:23| And I'd like to turn the mic over to my wife and let her have her five minutes that she's not going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22643)|
| 6:17:30| Please state your name, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22650)|
| 6:17:33| Debbie Stafford with the same address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22653)|
| 6:17:36| Thank you all very much for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22656)|
| 6:17:39| Commissioner Durrett, I appreciate your words tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22659)|
| 6:17:42| One thing that struck me, you said that it's your job to protect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22662)|
| 6:17:46| And while I appreciate the gesture, I don't feel like it's your job to protect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22666)|
| 6:17:51| I feel like it's your job to protect my rights because we're in a constitutional republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22671)|
| 6:17:56| It is all of your duties to protect my rights and to allow me to live as a free American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22676)|
| 6:18:03| You also brought up your daughter's illness, and I am so very sorry for what your family is enduring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22683)|
| 6:18:11| Many of you may remember my daughter that was here twice that's developmentally disabled as a 21-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22691)|
| 6:18:18| She wasn't always that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22698)|
| 6:18:20| She was born perfectly healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22700)|
| 6:18:22| And at nine months old, she was given a vaccine, and within days, she lost all language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22702)|
| 6:18:27| She lost her ability to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22707)|
| 6:18:29| She didn't even babble again for another six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22709)|
| 6:18:33| For two decades, I fought for her health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22713)|
| 6:18:36| In fact, I was a bookkeeper when she got sick, and now I'm a nurse practitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22716)|
| 6:18:40| I've traveled up and down the East Coast to try and get her help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22720)|
| 6:18:44| She ran a fever for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22724)|
| 6:18:47| Her kindergarten teacher called me every couple of days to complain about her fever that would never go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22727)|
| 6:18:53| She has complex four mitochondrial disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22733)|
| 6:18:56| She gets sick harder and longer than other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22736)|
| 6:19:00| Her average life expectancy is between 26 and 40 years old, depending on what research you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22740)|
| 6:19:07| She's 21. You all do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22747)|
| 6:19:10| She's in the minority that she's not yet having seizures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22750)|
| 6:19:13| but I can promise you it's something that scares me constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22753)|
| 6:19:21| I also see children with PANDAS in my clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22761)|
| 6:19:24| I don't know if you all are familiar with what PANDAS is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22764)|
| 6:19:27| I actually have two PANDAS children coming tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22767)|
| 6:19:30| because I'm the only provider in East Tennessee that sees these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22770)|
| 6:19:35| PANDAS is a neuropsychiatric disorder from strep infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22775)|
| 6:19:39| We also now understand that there's something called PANS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22779)|
| 6:19:42| which is a neurological syndrome that happens from viruses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22782)|
| 6:19:47| Basically what happens is they come in contact with strep or other pathogens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22787)|
| 6:19:52| and it's believed that even in the virus version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22792)|
| 6:19:55| there was probably initially a strep that triggered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22795)|
| 6:19:59| Their body attacks their brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22799)|
| 6:20:01| I'm not making this up. You can read about it at the National Institute of Mental Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22801)|
| 6:20:04| It's a very real condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22804)|
| 6:20:06| Dr. Sweeto is one of the leading researchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22806)|
| 6:20:09| One of the leading thoughts of why this happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22809)|
| 6:20:12| is because strep somehow gets in the cribriform plate up in the nose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22812)|
| 6:20:16| and somehow opens the blood-brain barrier, thus causing the cascade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22816)|
| 6:20:22| These children, whenever they come in contact with a virus or a bacteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22822)|
| 6:20:26| triggers their body to attack their nervous system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22826)|
| 6:20:29| These effects can be cumulative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22829)|
| 6:20:31| It's thought that up to a third of adults with schizophrenia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22831)|
| 6:20:34| probably had undiagnosed PANDAS as children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22834)|
| 6:20:37| That's just a guess at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22837)|
| 6:20:41| So I completely understand what it's like to fear someone getting sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22841)|
| 6:20:46| My daughter is one illness away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22846)|
| 6:20:48| She was hospitalized six times in her life, the last time two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22848)|
| 6:20:52| and I watched her in the hospital room, stuporous, wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22852)|
| 6:20:56| is this it? Is this finally the one that gets her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22856)|
| 6:20:59| Her CO2 level is never normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22859)|
| 6:21:03| Pardon my language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22863)|
| 6:21:05| It's a little disrespectful to cuss at you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22865)|
| 6:21:07| but I'll be damned if she's going to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22867)|
| 6:21:09| I don't care what kind of laws are passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22869)|
| 6:21:11| because her very life may be at risk if that CO2 builds up in her body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22871)|
| 6:21:17| Commissioner Daley, you state you don't want the Board of Health to make laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22877)|
| 6:21:21| but what's your solution? What's everyone's solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22881)|
| 6:21:23| Nothing? Because it seems like that's what's happening so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22883)|
| 6:21:28| The fear has largely been created by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22888)|
| 6:21:31| I'm not saying it's not anything to be scared of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22891)|
| 6:21:33| COVID's deadly, obviously, to some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22893)|
| 6:21:36| But we also have ways to fight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22896)|
| 6:21:41| You ask a board with unlimited power not to use the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22901)|
| 6:21:44| That's equivalent to putting me in front of a Big Mac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22904)|
| 6:21:46| and telling me, now, Debbie, don't you eat that Big Mac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22906)|
| 6:21:48| because I guarantee you I'm going to eat that Big Mac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22908)|
| 6:21:52| You could submit something to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22912)|
| 6:21:55| Like so many have said, we're not out to get the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22915)|
| 6:21:58| We're out to get our rights from being taken away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22918)|
| 6:22:02| I fully respect the jobs that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22922)|
| 6:22:04| I've tried to be complimentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22924)|
| 6:22:06| I apologize if I've not been as complimentary as I should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22926)|
| 6:22:08| I've told Commissioner Bussler and Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22928)|
| 6:22:11| about all the wonderful things that the Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22931)|
| 6:22:14| not the Board of Health, but under Dr. Buchanan's leadership, has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22934)|
| 6:22:22| And, Commissioner Jay, this is probably going to come across disrespectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22942)|
| 6:22:27| but to hear you constantly complaining about time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22947)|
| 6:22:30| You work for us. We don't work for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22950)|
| 6:22:33| You berated Mr. Bussler about him taking too much time to answer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22953)|
| 6:22:37| With all due respect, if your personal life brings you such difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22957)|
| 6:22:41| that time here keeps you from doing your job, you need to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22961)|
| 6:22:45| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22965)|
| 6:22:46| Because we work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22966)|
| 6:22:47| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22967)|
| 6:22:49| That concludes the end of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22969)|
| 6:22:51| Everybody, I can listen to all your citizens that waited here to talk to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22971)|
| 6:22:54| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22974)|
| 6:22:56| Listen to the people! Listen to the people! Listen to the people!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22976)|
| 6:23:01| I'll entertain a motion to adjourn this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22981)|
| 6:23:04| Listen to your people!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22984)|
| 6:23:05| I'll make a motion to adjourn the meeting. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22985)|
| 6:23:08| We're not leaving! We're not leaving!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22988)|
| 6:23:11| You will listen! You will listen!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22991)|
| 6:23:14| Sir, we have listened, and we have listened, and we have listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22994)|
| 6:23:18| Don't listen more or resign!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=22998)|
| 6:23:20| Sir, we have listened respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23000)|
| 6:23:22| No, you have not. You have turned!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23002)|
| 6:23:24| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23004)|
| 6:23:54| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23034)|
| 6:24:25| And I'm a Knox County citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23065)|
| 6:24:30| This is not mutual respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23070)|
| 6:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23072)|
| 6:24:33| This is not mutual respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23073)|
| 6:24:35| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23075)|
| 6:24:37| Can you resign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23077)|
| 6:24:38| Listen, give me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23078)|
| 6:24:41| Can I speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23081)|
| 6:24:42| Guys, thank you for letting me speak. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23082)|
| 6:24:45| This is not mutual respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23085)|
| 6:24:47| Okay, can I speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23087)|
| 6:24:49| We have listened, and we have listened, and you have all come to us time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23089)|
| 6:24:53| and we have been very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23093)|
| 6:24:55| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23095)|
| 6:25:23| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23123)|
| 6:25:53| I can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23153)|
| 6:25:54| It's horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23154)|
| 6:25:55| It hurts your immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23155)|
| 6:25:57| I live in faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23157)|
| 6:25:58| I'm not living in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23158)|
| 6:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23160)|
| 6:26:06| Next person to then get hurt, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23166)|
| 6:26:08| I want to speak just for a moment, Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23168)|
| 6:26:11| In disrespect to the shows of you in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23171)|
| 6:26:14| the individuals emailing you, saying horrendous things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23174)|
| 6:26:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23178)|
| 6:26:20| I came to the meeting today upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23180)|
| 6:26:23| Upset with what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23183)|
| 6:26:25| But I experienced something along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23185)|
| 6:26:28| There was a young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23188)|
| 6:26:30| We had a meeting today at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23190)|
| 6:26:32| And I saw a young man pushing his bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23192)|
| 6:26:35| Both tires were flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23195)|
| 6:26:38| I came here about 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23198)|
| 6:26:40| and I saw the same young man about three miles down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23200)|
| 6:26:45| I turned my car around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23205)|
| 6:26:48| He was obviously older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23208)|
| 6:26:50| I gave him $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23210)|
| 6:26:52| I told him where the bicycle shop was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23212)|
| 6:26:55| I gave him my business card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23215)|
| 6:26:57| And I said, I want you to go to the bicycle shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23217)|
| 6:27:00| I want you to get your tires fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23220)|
| 6:27:02| and I want you to have a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23222)|
| 6:27:04| He had difficulty looking me in the eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23224)|
| 6:27:07| and he said something to me, which basically hurt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23227)|
| 6:27:10| He said, no one else will talk to me because I work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23230)|
| 6:27:15| But I experienced something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23235)|
| 6:27:17| And I know that sounds self-critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23237)|
| 6:27:20| But it hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23240)|
| 6:27:22| And I saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23242)|
| 6:27:23| And I put the situation out for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23243)|
| 6:27:25| I went across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23245)|
| 6:27:27| I came here about 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23247)|
| 6:27:29| This has not been about the bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23249)|
| 6:27:31| It has been about replacing him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23251)|
| 6:27:36| He gets beaten twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23256)|
| 6:27:38| This is the most recent physical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23258)|

| 6:27:53| How old the mandates are placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23273)|

| 6:28:01| No one else will talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23281)|
| 6:28:03| That's what we have talked all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23283)|
| 6:28:06| The reality to this is that health departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23286)|
| 6:28:11| They're secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23291)|

| 6:28:51| you had a 25.6% chance of dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23331)|

| 6:29:24| because they keep moving the target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23364)|

| 6:30:33| We can't have responsibility and authority separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23433)|
| 6:30:39| With that, I will relinquish to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=23439)|
