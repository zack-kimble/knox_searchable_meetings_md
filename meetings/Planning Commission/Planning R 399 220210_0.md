| 0:08:42| I understand there might be some objections to the postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| If you'd come up to the podium, please, give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| And just be brief, please, because we're just asking right now for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| My name is Charles Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| I live at 4801 Tazewell Pike, very close to this planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| I'm also the attorney for a number of organizations, the Tazewell Pike, Beverly Station Neighborhood Coalition, and Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=545)|
| 0:09:14| We're here in opposition to a postponement of item number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| My neighbors and I appeared last month in fairly large numbers to oppose this inappropriate development in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=559)|
| 0:09:27| And when it became obvious at the meeting that the applicant was not going to get what he hoped to, he moved for a continuance or a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=567)|
| 0:09:36| And after some discussion, we opposed the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| And after some discussion, the commission told us that it was traditional to give an applicant at least one postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| And we accepted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| We went back home in the good faith belief that after that one postponement, we could come back here today and have this matter heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=588)|
| 0:09:58| It turns out now that apparently the applicant is still not prepared to go forward and wants a second postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| And once again, my neighbors and I have appeared here at great expense, a lot of trouble, to oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| And we respectfully submit it's just not fair to us to make us come back a third time in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| The staff recommended against this development last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Nothing's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| It shouldn't be drug out any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| And we respectfully ask that you deny the postponement and let it be heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| My name is Shelly Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| I live at 5011 Dovewood Way in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| Our subdivision, the Joshua's Landing Homeowners Subdivision, is directly across the street from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=643)|
| 0:10:53| And we oppose the continuance for the same reasons spoken by Attorney Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| The thing that makes us unique is we are right across the street, and so we do see all of that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| Even with this change that they're proposing to start a new application process in the next month will not change the effect on the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=665)|
| 0:11:15| And so we do not believe that a postponement will do anything to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| You heard the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Chair will entertain a motion on the postponement list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| Motion to postpone for 30 days is read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| Chairman, are we voting on all the postponements or just this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| All the postponements, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Is this one included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Item number seven is included, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| So if you don't support the motion, then you would vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| If you do support the motion, you vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| We can still postpone this if we hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=720)|

| 0:19:31| I'm at a bit of a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| I hadn't been down here in a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| so I had a little computer deal set up to put up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| but we ended up having to make copies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| for everybody at the last minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| so it'll be a bit cumbersome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| but if you can just follow with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Some of this is just repeat of what the staff had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| but I just wanted to point out again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| that we requested 12 units per acre on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| and we feel like it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| If you look at the sector plan, which is on the board right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| we're actually in the sector plan for a commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| so it's felt that the property is suitable for commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| which I think is more of a lateral move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| to a 12-density units per acre and planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| because we'll have to bring that plan back down to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| and then be approved under PR as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| Another, I don't know if they have the slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| where it shows the actual zonings of the property around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| We're already zoned planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| It's really about the density assigned to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| We've got medium density around us already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| and to the north of us is a commercially zoned piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| although it's developed with duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| which is the same thing we want to do, but it is zoned CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| and across the street is industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| So there's a mixed bag of zoning in the area already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I just don't think PR at 12 units an acre is offensive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| I also threw in another slide of where the new Knox County road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| is coming through, the Chaud Road extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| that I believe phase 2 and 3 has, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| a price tag of $30 to $40-some-odd million of the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| that are going on literally in front of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| So from a traffic perspective, I don't see that as being an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| There was one comment on your website from someone in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| who indicated they didn't like 12 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| because there had been no road improvements done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| So I'm not sure how long it's been since they've been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| but there's a $30- or $40-million project going on at the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| After reading staff's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| when they recommended seven dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| I noticed that one of their concerns was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| it says the planned right-of-way improvements for Andy's Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| at this location demonstrate a grade change of 18 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| and the vertical alignment of a driveway at 19% grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| which will require slope easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| and present additional challenges related to the build-out of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Because of this access situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| staff recommends PR at seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Now, once we understood where staff was coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| I had David Harvin, my civil engineer, take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| and he was able to design a road access to this property at 5% grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| not 19% grade, but 5% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| So we actually had some conversations with Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| and they took a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| and didn't seem to have any issues with what we were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| So with that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| that all came after staff had made their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| and we knew what the concern was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| So I would ultimately like you to consider the 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| I also, in my little packet that I showed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| overlaid what our current concept is on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| So you'll see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| It's probably the second to the last page in the packet that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| or on the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| I don't know if they printed it on the front and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| But it shows the scale of what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| compared to the other residences that are in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| I think it fits very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| As you can see, our footprint is only 30 feet by 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| They're two-story townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| I think it's a good opportunity for infill in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| where we've already got medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| The only difference between the two housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| is we're two-story with a townhome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| and they are all one-story that are behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| So that's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| So in summary, we're surrounded by medium-density residential already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| commercial zoning and industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| The property is appropriate for commercial per the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| There's a $30 or $40 million road improvement going on in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| And we were able to reduce that 19% grade down to 5% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| The size of scale blends in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| And we certainly, I think as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| have a housing shortage in Knoxville right now, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| So we're just trying to build a few extra units here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| to help house future Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Thank you, Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Not seeing any other individual in public wishing to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| so I'll open it up for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Chair recognizes Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1468)|
| 0:24:40| Yes, sir, Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| It obviously looks like with the new road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| that he's got on one of these handouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| there is a turn lane at the intersection that backs up quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| So he'd be accessing the property on the far end of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| away from the turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| So it looks to me like, at least from this schematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| that his access point works on this overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Did you guys agree with their assessment of this point of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| on the road and the grades and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| We looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| The original, I guess the previous alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| showed the driveway coming in a little bit, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| closer to the main roadway realignment by moving it down grade a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| I think that, plus chasing it and getting a longer profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| after looking at David's design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| we felt like the 5% grade was appropriate and a reasonable approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| And there wouldn't be any other issues with stormwater or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| We are filling up to get a bridge created to this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| but we looked and all the structures and parking were outside our fill slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| so we didn't have any concerns in regard to our construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| and their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Slope easements or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| They were all outside the paved areas and buildings that he proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| Tom, what size are these units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| They're approximately 1,200 square feet each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| 600 down, 600 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Myself, I have no –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| I think we've got to get more comfortable with density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| and giving people the opportunity to create something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| especially affordable housing right now is so badly needed in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| I could be supportive of 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| and I think the first thing is the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| which staff has recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Is it appropriate to make a motion on the sector plan now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| or would you rather have more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| You can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| We'll still seek comments, but you can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Yeah, I'll go ahead and make a motion on the sector plan just to get that out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| I'll make a motion we approve the sector plan amendment to MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| because it's a minor extension of an existing area zone for medium-density residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Commissioner Hill, you had your comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Seeing no other lights on, chair will –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| we've got a motion by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| to approve MDR medium-density residential on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Chair will recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Thanks, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| I'd just like to hear from staff with this revised information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| what would your recommendation change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| We would definitely want to defer to Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| I mean, they're more of the experts related to what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| for the improvements for this major infrastructure that's going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| So, you know, if Knox County Engineering is okay with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| then I think we would lean on their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Chair recognizes Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| This might be a question for Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| Are there any pedestrian improvements planned with this bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| and the road realignment, or is it just road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Along the new roadway, there will be sidewalks on both sides of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| so there will be a much more enhanced pedestrian footprint in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1723)|
| 0:28:52| Seeing no other comments, Chair will entertain Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| I'd like a motion that we approve PR at 12 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| because it's a minor extension of the existing zone's residential density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| seconded by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| to approve PR plan residential zoning up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| Mr. Huber, do you have any questions, or do you want to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| No, I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| You've heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Have a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| Next is agenda item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| This is a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| File 1N22RZ and 1E22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Applicant is Turner Homes, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| Location, west side of Andes Road, north side of Troutman Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| Tract is 14.61 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Present plan designation zoning is low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| hillside protection, and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Opposed plan designation and zoning, medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| hillside protection, and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| Density proposed, seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Staff recommendation, deny the sector plan amendment to medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| because it is not compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| On the rezoning, staff recommends PR planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| because it is consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| Not seeing anyone signed up for opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Is there anyone in opposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Mr. Mullins, your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Here for the applicant, Turner Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I also have some representatives of Turner Homes here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| I got Mr. Buckner, who is the family of the property here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Mr. Stephon Klar, and Mr. Randy Corlew as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| They can maybe answer some technical questions if it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| We appreciate the work staff has done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| However, we are still asking that the applicant move forward with its request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| to amend the sector plan to medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| and to approve PR at seven dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| I understand staff's concern is they don't believe that this is a minor extension of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1894)|
| 0:31:42| You point out, looking at the map there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| that you have about 725 feet of the property line contiguous to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| to an existing medium density residential sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| and that development there is zoned at planned residential at seven dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| I think it's built out pretty close to that at maybe 6.7, 6.8 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| When we're talking about sector plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| it really doesn't come down to whether it's a minor extension or a major extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| Those terms aren't found in the criteria for amending sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| The criteria, the four criteria that they're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| are there a change of conditions that warrant amending the land use plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| or is there an introduction of significant new roads or utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| that were not anticipated in the plan and make the development more feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| There's a couple of other criteria for amending sector plans as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| but when you're looking at amending sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| you only need to meet one of the four criteria that's listed in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| I think we meet at least two, maybe three of these because of the shod road extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| That is the introduction of a significant new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| Mr. Huber was talking about it being a multimillion dollar project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| that is about 900 feet to the north along Andes Road to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| It will introduce more development opportunities into this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| because of that extension of shod road and Andes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| The road right there, Andes, it's 21 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| It's a major collector. It's in the 60 feet right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| I know there were some comments about how Andes Road is very curvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| From this development to the new intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| it's very straight and very flat and 21 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| So certainly with the new traffic that is introduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| there's more opportunities for medium-density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| And this is the only area, really, everything else to the north is built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| This is the only area where you can look at taking advantage of the introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| of new roads into this area and developing it as medium-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| And when you're looking at the type of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| the staff has recommended five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| which would be about, on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| if you build out at the maximum, about 70 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| That would not trigger the need for a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| At seven dwelling units an acre, you're looking at another 29 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| so 99 units total at build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| That would trigger the need for a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| And it would give this developer an opportunity to partner with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| to address any road improvements in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| realignment of the shoulders there, access into this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| to partner with them to really address the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| that this development would have on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| It's planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| so we know it's going to come back down to us on a site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| And we have an already proposed site plan in mind because Turner Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| they're in the business of developing property such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| They're looking at how can we make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| And their concept is actually to try to do some townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| about 1,400 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| try to hit that missing middle market in the housing market right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| that is desperately needed to help bring up inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| and bring up inventory for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| for people that are looking for a starter home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| or for people that are looking to downsize into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| where they have less maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| There's been some concern about access to Troutman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| And this concept, and I know this will come back before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| but the concept is to really not have the access to the subdivision as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| be on Troutman, but to reserve that area in the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| which is in the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| to really be three single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| And if you look at the build-out on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| it would be about 1.9, less than two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| with three individual driveway accesses onto Troutman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| So we don't, you know, Troutman is a significantly smaller road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| and so we're not really impacting or overburdening traffic on Troutman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| I know there's some concern about the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| between Andes and Troutman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| and this development really wouldn't affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| And if I could, may I ask Mr. Snowden or someone from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| if they could comment on if they have any concerns about Andes Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| from the proposed intersection of Shod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| to where we would access the development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| at the northeastern corner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| about being able to accommodate the traffic at seven units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| Aaron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| And I'm kind of working off memory here a little bit from the Shod Road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| It's been a while since I've looked at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| but it's my recollection that we're actually filling through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| like Jim said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| So it's going to take a little while for that road to get tied back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| I believe we tie back down with Andes Road right there at Norway Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| So all of that's going to be improved up to Norway right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| and that will be a 22-foot wide section, 11-foot driving lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| improved shoulder, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| So as far as the condition of the road between their access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| and the new Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| I don't see any issue with it being able to carry that additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| Thank you, Aaron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| I see that I'm out of time here, so I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| I want to just make a close of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| We just approved Mr. Huber's development 430 feet to the north at 12 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| using the same justification that the Shod Road improvement would bring more opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| and allow there to be an opportunity for medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| to help fill the dire need for housing in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| and we think that there's not any significant difference between what we're trying to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| and what was approved up there, at least with the seven units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| which staff recommended for the property to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| and that's what we're asking for here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Seeing no other comments, Chair wanted to ask Ms. Adams if I can ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| I appreciate Mr. Mullins' comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| He noted that the development, thank you, where the cursor is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| has been built out to seven units per acre, and that's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| but there are two developments that are on the sides of this parcel that are considerably less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| as is the property on Troutman, across Troutman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| So while one small area is connected to a seven dwelling units per acre, the others are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| So staff has recommended this five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| I'm even wondering how they got to five because of the one to three in the other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| So I support staff's denial of the sector plan, and I also support their recommendation of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Chair recognizes Commissioner Minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Hi, I appreciate Commissioner Adams' comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| I also agree with her assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| and I also am looking at the other adjoining piece of property on Andes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| because I know a lot of our decisions are based by adjoining properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| I know right now it's just a single-family residence, but at some point this will be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| and my concern by extending the MDR to this is that this other property subsequently might come up in front of our committee in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2379)|
| 0:39:48| affecting this property adjacent to it on Reagan Woods Lane even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| I do support staff's recommendation, and I make a motion to approve staff's recommendation of low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2393)|
| 0:40:03| denying medium-density residential and hillside protection for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| Before we go to the vote, Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| I'm just going to say the opposite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| For the same reasoning as the last case, I think the MDRs sound appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| I think the density when it's together is probably better to have, since there is higher density adjacent to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2429)|
| 0:40:40| versus spreading out, and if we're going to build the same number of units in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| it's probably best to try to keep them closer together as in the future bus routes start to form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| and other roadway improvements come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| So I would actually support going with the MDR for the MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Commissioner, I don't know if your mic is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| Testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Yeah, I think you have to get a little closer on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| Thank you, Chairman Films.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I'm going to echo what he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| I think it does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| I think it's an extension, and I think through the road improvements, I think seven units make sense to give us some ability there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2481)|
| 0:41:29| not only more density, but more ability to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| And plan residential, I think, is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| So I would support MDR and seven units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| I know we've got a motion on the floor, but that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| Mr. Mullins, can you tell me how many acres in the hillside protection area that you will not be using for the more dense development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2508)|
| 0:41:59| I believe we're looking at about three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| I'm sorry, 1.4 acres is the hillside, and it's really not that steep, but it's all along the south there on Troutman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2526)|
| 0:42:18| If you run the slope analysis, I know staff did, they came up with 4.75 at five units an acre being a base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| If you put in our request at seven, you get like 6.76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| So we're still in the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| There's very minimal slope impact on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Ben, did you say that where the hillside protection is, you're just going to do three single-family units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| So that's kind of a moot point anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| It is because, I mean, we're really not as concerned about the hillside as we are just having access onto Troutman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| and that's one of the things, and Engineering Public Works can confirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| we ran it by them that they wouldn't have an issue with us not having a second ingress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| egress onto Troutman and terminating that and having those three driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| So we ran that by them before we went forward with that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| And then your comment about being able to work with the county highway department on a public-private partnership on some extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| I guess have you guys already done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| We've talked to them about some things that need to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| but, of course, really to assess the impact, they'll have to be attracted to the impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| and, you know, at five units an acre, you're below that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Yes, I just wanted to comment on, I don't think that this is similar to, I mean, it's similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| but I do not think it is the same as the agenda item five that we just looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| because if you consider how agenda item five has really a role of transition from shod into other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2628)|
| 0:44:01| and it's abutting or it's part of the commercial area, this parcel is not doing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| It's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| It's housed around much smaller density, more single-family residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| and it's not serving that same kind of transitional role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| So I still support Commissioner Midas' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Seeing no other comments, we do have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| seconded by Commissioner Adams to deny the sector plan amendment to medium density residential per stash recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2671)|
| 0:44:40| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| I don't know if it's necessary to call the roll, but let's go ahead and call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2694)|

| 0:45:40| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Chair will entertain a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to MDR medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| What was the motion, Pat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Motion to amend the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| And let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| I should have mentioned this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| On sector plan amendments, we do need justification for changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| So Commissioner Nichols, if you could, in your motion, give an explanation on the reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| behind your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| It could be as simple as improvements to transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Well, we need more housing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| And to me, in my opinion, that area would accommodate or support the change in sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| So we do have a motion by Commissioner Nichols, seconded by Commissioner Higgins to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| the medium density residential sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2804)|

| 0:47:15| Before we vote, Commissioner Adams, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2840)|

| 0:47:46| This is a rezoning file 2A22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| Applicant is Elliot Jetton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Location, north side of Gleason Drive, southwest of Echo Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Tract is 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| The request is for 2.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| Present zoning is plan residential zoning up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| Zoning requested RA low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| Staff recommendation approved RA low density residential because it is consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| the southwest county sector plan and existing residential development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| Is the applicant present, Mr. Jetton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| We also have Ms. Pennell signed up for opposition or speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| Is there anyone else desiring to speak on this item besides the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Mr. Jetton, you are up and your name and address and you have up to five minutes, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Elliot Jetton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| My address is 917 Corning Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| I'm the son of the property owner, David Jetton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| I just wanted to take this time to thank you all for your service to the county and just wanted to clear some air on the public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| I think there might be a little bit confusion as to what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| There has been some history with the property and the rezoning for the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Only thing that we're asking here is to rezone a portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| It's 420 feet approximately by 210 feet to RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| The purpose of that is just for me to build a personal home on my father's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| We're not asking for any more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| That's really the gist of our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2969)|
| 0:49:39| I apologize for not pronouncing your name correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Is there a motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| Is there any opposition to this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Do you want to come up to the podium, please, and give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| I'm Susan Panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| I live in the property that's at the bottom of the hill behind this hill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| I guess my only concern is there is a creek that runs behind us and a steep hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| and I worry about the runoff from any development on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3019)|
| 0:50:27| That's certainly understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| Right now it's currently zoned planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| so under the rule right now he could develop up to four dwelling units per acre on the 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3034)|
| 0:50:44| I think right now what he's asking for is on the 2.02 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| He's really going down zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| In terms of impacts in your area, I don't think it would be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3050)|
| 0:50:58| That's my only concern, that we don't have more runoff down that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3065)|

| 0:51:15| existing residential development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3075)|

| 0:52:25| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Adam Wilson, 9505 Caryback Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Planning Commission and staff, I would first like to genuinely thank each of you for your service to our community and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| My name is Adam Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| I'm a real estate broker, the owner of 9821 Dutchtown Road and a proud resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| And I'd like to say while I wasn't born in Tennessee, I got here as fast as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| I bought my first duplex in San Diego as a 23-year-old ensign in the United States Navy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| and I've purchased three additional multifamily properties since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| In 18 years of being a landlord, I've never had an eviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| I've never had a tenant not pay me, and I've never had a tenant trash one of my places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| I've rented to all ages, all colors, all religions, and all sexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| And while I don't always agree for the football team they cheer for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| it's never stopped us from becoming friends and doing business together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| The single most important thing I can say to you today is that I have a rushed version of a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| and two sets of house plans, and I do have that printed that I can distribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| that show that I have a viable eight-unit development that can be done without a single variance required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3210)|
| 0:53:38| I was in attendance at the pre-planning meeting on Tuesday the 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| and I would like to clarify that unless the county is going to force me to subdivide, I wasn't planning to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| and it's my understanding that that would eliminate the need for a 40-foot right-of-way required in subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| And so I really haven't even looked into subdividing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| because my intention and my desire is to hold these units for the rest of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| I've been bugging poor Mr. Reynolds here for five years asking about various properties having multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| or multifamily development potential in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| I had to transition my retirement plan from acquiring four already built duplexes to personally constructing eight rental units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3256)|
| 0:54:25| because the Knoxville market routinely yields so few two-, three-, and four-unit properties a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| that qualify for the standards of my personal rental portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| The lack of quality multi-unit properties is so severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| In 2013, I was forced to leave my first real estate brokerage, Southland Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| for a residential brokerage because I needed something to be able to sell my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| And as each of you well know, the greater Knoxville area is in the midst of a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| The staff is recommending a five-unit development while I requested an eight-unit development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| and I'm here to say that three units makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| The obvious is that there will be three families with nowhere to live to whom these three units will make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| The less obvious is that the rental market that saw a 30 percent increase in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| these three units make a difference because we all know that rent does not go up because there are too many places available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| My request alleviates while the recommendation unnecessarily exacerbates a growing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| I look forward to working with the planning staff prior to and through the use-on-review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| to produce an eight-unit development that complements, if not improves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| what is already in the immediate area of 9821 Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| The use-on-review process keeps me honest on my intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| and prevents unhealthy, uncharacteristic development from being a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| In reality, our concept plan will have the second lowest units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| when compared to the four other constructed, approved, or staff-recommended multifamily developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3362)|
| 0:56:11| within 600 feet of 9821 Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| I'm asking for the same five-unit per acre opportunity that was given to my neighbor 100 feet to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| which was item 22, Mr. George's Brandon's property, that you unanimously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| Unfortunately, I cannot afford this property, to develop this property, at less than five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| And if this project cannot go forward, I will be condemned to purchasing eight single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| which will thus deny home ownership to eight families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| Three units makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Thank you, Mr. Wills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| Levin, do you have any comments you would like to make on staff's recommendation on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3413)|
| 0:57:03| Yeah, if you have any specific questions, I would be happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| But, yeah, I guess I'd be okay with waiting until there's more specific direction on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3429)|
| 0:57:17| I've not seen any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| In looking at this, this is a really—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| Commissioner, if you could speak into your microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| In looking at this, this is a really odd-shaped piece of property for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3458)|
| 0:57:47| And one of the reasons for planned residential—and it's stated right in our write-up here—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3467)|
| 0:57:57| is to develop odd-shaped—well, let me read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| Planned residential zoning is intended to provide optional methods of land development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| which encourage more imaginative solutions to environmental design problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| And I think that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| And we're talking about rezoning now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| We're not talking about a concept plan or a use-on-review or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| Just what can—what zone can we put on that that would encourage this type of development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3512)|
| 0:58:43| We don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| And the gentleman stood there, and he told us that he's designed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| but I don't think he's the engineer on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| So my thoughts on this is we rezone it at five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3537)|
| 0:59:07| If he can get five to the acre on there, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| If he can't, that's his problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| But give him the option to try and develop this property to its fullest extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3557)|
| 0:59:26| So unless somebody else wants to make a motion or speak, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3566)|
| 0:59:34| Yeah, I think before we vote, we do have a staff that reviews these quite thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3574)|
| 0:59:42| And they look at the surrounding properties and look at the sector plan and see how everything fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| I think unless there's something abnormally wrong here, I'd like to go with staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| That's what we hire them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| That's why they're here in the building to advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| If that's what we're going to do, the 13 of us may as well get up and leave right now and never come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3602)|
| 1:00:13| But staff do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| We're here to oversee that and make sure everything falls in line correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| Personally, I'm not hearing anything that would lend me to deviate from staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| A couple hundred feet down the street, we just approved on consent another five to the acre right on that corner of Bob Kirby and Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3628)|
| 1:00:43| Not a couple hundred feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| And every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| There's no two pieces that are similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| And this looks like a rectangular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| This one is different enough that we need to give engineers the opportunity to try and design something to fit on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| If it doesn't fit, you don't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| That's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| Thank you, Chairman Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Above it, we have four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| To the right of it, I'm looking at playing north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| I guess that would be east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| We've got five or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| And I'm in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| I think if we can make it work with eight units on this piece of property, I think it works fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| But with it being PR, obviously it's got to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| We've got to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| If we don't like it, we can turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| I would like to hear from staff as to, you know, why not the higher density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3707)|
| 1:01:56| Can you guys hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| I do think one thing to take into consideration about the PR zone is that it doesn't have a minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3718)|
| 1:02:06| So it does offer the ability to cluster density in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| And like I already mentioned about this property, it is a fairly unique shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| It resembles to some extent a flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Because there's no – you can cluster that density throughout the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| There is, to some degree, the possibility that you could have all that density in the flag portion rather than the flagpole section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3744)|
| 1:02:34| So in this instance here, it is possible under the planned residential zone that you do see all of the density in the north section right up against the single family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3754)|
| 1:02:49| So I did want to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| That is one thing to consider about that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| I am always wanting to hear the applicant, the opposition, the whole story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| But when we are asked to look at a rezoning, unless something changed, we are asked to look at not how it's going to be used or the explicit details of a wonderful plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3790)|
| 1:03:26| We're supposed to just look at is this the right rezoning for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| Not contingent on who might build on it that very moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Because that could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| So as compelling as the applicant's comments are, I kind of default back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| And then listening to comments from other commissioners about, well, we can go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| And then just, if we don't like the concept plan, we can change it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| We rarely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| When we get to that point, typically the comment is that someone has already made such an investment at that point that it's really not a great time to make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3841)|
| 1:04:12| So I'm not comforted by, well, just give someone a go and then see what comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| Because typically when it gets to that point, most people don't feel comfortable demanding a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| So for that reason, I support staff's recommendation for this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3865)|
| 1:04:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Chair recognizes Commissioner Wooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| Yeah, I'm not big on this one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| But I think what's got me going on this is on the first page of the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| this piece of property is on a minor arterial road in West Knox County, close into Seeger Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| They just did road improvements on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| They did road improvements in 2009, including widening the road with additions at center and turn lanes and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| You've got an RB zone across the street, which is a mobile home site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| You've got two schools a quarter of a mile from here and more county schools within, I guess, a mile and a half, two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3909)|
| 1:05:19| I mean, that's where you're supposed to put density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| I mean, on a minor arterial, I'm a little upset this guy doesn't have this piece of property to the east of him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| that is contiguous with the five per acre because you really could have had something nice there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| If you don't buy it, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| But I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| But, yeah, we won't pre-zone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| You're not going to do any good with just a couple houses in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| It just doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| And on a minor arterial, we need to get some density on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| That's where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| And we've got the infrastructure to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| So I would be for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Chair recognizes Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| One quick question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| The concern of staff was that you would concentrate all the density in the back larger portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| Is that your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| I have it printed out if you'd like to see how it is viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| I personally have no interest in-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| You can make it work to disperse it throughout the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| I want as many-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| I mean, I would be prepared to make a motion to give him the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| and condition it upon not concentrating density at the back part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| I'm not sure you can condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| I mean, I think if you want to approve it at five dwelling his per acre, just state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| I wouldn't condition it or any kind of-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Yeah, I'll make that motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| I'll make the motion that we recommend approval at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| And it's not conditioned, but we'd like to see the density disperse throughout the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| I have a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Could we also ask in tandem-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| No, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| That we maybe have a buffer back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| It sounded like one of the staff's concerns was that there would be a lot of density back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| and we had a lot of low density on the back side there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| If we could make certain we have a nice buffer protecting those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| I will say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| That would be in the concept plan, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| So we'll be able to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| In the concept plan when it comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Can you include that in the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| You want to add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| It'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Any other comments from commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| We've got a motion by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Hooten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| to rezone PR plan residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4074)|
| 1:08:00| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| Next item is agenda item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| This is a subdivision concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| We have variances, concept plan and development plan with peripheral setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| This is file 1SB22C and 1G22UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| Subdivision is Mission Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Applicant developer is Smith, S&E Properties, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| Location, north side of Hardin Valley Drive, west side of Mission Hills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| Track size, 8.85 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| Zoned PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Number of lots, 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| There are three variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| Staff recommendation, approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| based on the justifications provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| and the recommendations of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| Because the site conditions restrict compliance with subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| and the proposed variances will not create any traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| Staff also recommends approve the concept plan subject to ten conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| The final motion, approve the development plan for up to 26 detached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| on individual lots and the peripheral setback reduction from 35 feet to 30 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| for the southern lot line of lot one and 21 and the 20 feet for lots 22 to 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| That's the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| We do have some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first or would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| I'd like the opposition to go first, but if I could, I have some handouts on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| I need to pass out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| Mr. Wayne Kline, are you representing the opposition in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| You want to come up to the podium and give us your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| My name is Wayne Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| I'm an attorney here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| I represent Massey Creek Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Massey Creek is the subdivision at the top of the Mission Hill lane that we're talking about here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4227)|
| 1:10:36| We are opposing here in opposition to the strip of land that contains potentially five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4236)|
| 1:10:47| We're not here opposing the subdivision itself or the concept plan that involves the 21 houses in Road A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4247)|
| 1:11:00| or around Road A in that cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| We're here because after the concept plan, after these 21 houses, there are five lots that are now being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4264)|
| 1:11:14| to have driveways on Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Mission Hill Lane is an access boulevard, lane, road, local arterial road to my client's subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| And at the bottom is a central divider median that comes off of Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4284)|
| 1:11:35| and comes up Mission Hill Lane and divides Mission Hill Lane into two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| One lane is an ingress route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| And you have it up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| I wonder if my pointer will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Good, it does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| So here's Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| You see the dividers here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Those are the central divider medians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| And so it divides one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| That is, I call this the ingress lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| As you go up the hill over here to the subdivision, from the other side, which is the egress lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| Now these five lots, one, two, three, four, five, are proposed for addition into the Mission Hills concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4336)|
| 1:12:28| And yet the only access to them is from the Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| You can't access them from the cul-de-sac road, which is now being called Road A over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| You can't access them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| And you were told last month by Mr. Gray, who's the engineer for your applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| that there's a 30-foot or more, about 32 feet drop in topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| from the houses that surround the cul-de-sac and these five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| So there's no way to get a road, an access road, from Mission Hill Lane over to Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4381)|
| 1:13:10| And also, if you tried, even if you tried to take that break and have connectivity over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| you can't do it because he's got it all completely surrounded with homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| So when you're looking at the staff recommendation, where there are ten conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| and it says on the number four, placing a note on the final plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| that Lots 1 through 21 shall have access only to the internal street system, that's Road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| and Lots 22 through 26 shall have access to either Mission Hill Lane or the internal street system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| The only access on those five lots is from Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| Mission Hill Lane doesn't provide appropriate ingress to these five lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| because what you have to do in order to access these lots from Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| is go up the ingress lane all the way up here and either do a U-turn up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| which is fundamentally unsafe, or continue on up into the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4451)|
| 1:14:18| into a cul-de-sac up at the top, and then turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| And this is important in several ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| The first way it's important is the residence for these five homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Every time they leave their house and come home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| they have to come up and do a U-turn or go all the way up to a cul-de-sac in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| my client's subdivision, not Mission Hill's subdivision, and turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| That makes it dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| But what's more dangerous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| What's more dangerous is that any vehicle that wants to access these five houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| with driveways that are being proposed to be put on Mission Hill Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| have to come up the ingress lane and turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| There's not enough width there for a fire engine, for a 911 vehicle, for an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| And so those turns would be three, five, and seven-point turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| That's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| That's an improper way to place houses in this Mission Hill subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| which, by the way, doesn't look like he's trying to put them in the Mission Hill subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| He's trying to put them in Massey Creek subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| because they're 30 feet below the Mission Hill subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| They're not part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| You can't access them from Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| And so it's an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| And originally, the 21 houses that were approved early on didn't have those five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4545)|
| 1:15:54| Apparently, after a period of time, your applicant purchased this to try to add these lots to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4554)|
| 1:16:05| So Mission Hill Lane is professionally sodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| That's the access, again, over here to my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Mr. Kline, your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| If you can wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Okay, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| It's professionally sodded, irrigated, lighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| And, folks, you don't use this kind of unsafe approval for this kind of these five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4583)|
| 1:16:40| I've been here for 34 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| I've been here through many of these type of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| And always, safety of our community is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| This is unsafe, and it should not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| Mr. Mullins, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| Can I have a little bit of additional time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| Perhaps it looks like he went over a fair amount there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| I'm trying to stick within the five, but if it goes over, then we'll probably have to give it to Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| I'll do my best, but it goes quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| We appreciate staff's work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| The previous recommendation at last month's meeting was to approve the concept plan with these five units having access to Mission Hills Lane with individual driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4640)|
| 1:17:31| And the reason staff recommended approval for that application at that time was that it met all the applicable zoning ordinances and subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4651)|
| 1:17:42| The only difference in their application or their recommendation now is condition number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| where they have revised this access instead of having five individual lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| and to have two shared driveways and a maximum of three driveway connections to Mission Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| and then there would be a vehicular turnaround on each lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| The applicant is opposed to that condition and would ask that staff's recommendation from the previous month be what is approved here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4683)|
| 1:18:19| The reason is, one, it won't work for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| We have a letter in the packet that I just handed out from Rusty Ensor, a real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| who says there's no other subdivisions in Hardin Valley that have this type of shared access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| and that it would basically torpedo the market for those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| But more importantly than that, this request for these shared driveway accesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| that was not requested by the county EPW because of traffic access or safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4731)|
| 1:18:59| It doesn't improve traffic access or safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| When you have these shared driveways, it doesn't reduce the impact to the property either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| You'll only have fewer curb cuts, but those curb cuts will be wider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| because when you have a shared driveway, it's got to accommodate two vehicles so they can pass back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| You're basically making a two-lane road instead of a one-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| And then they're asking for the turnaround, which is also further burdening the lack of green space and adding impervious areas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4763)|
| 1:19:33| So one driveway for each five actually has less impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| And this doesn't add any issue with safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| And I would ask Engineering and Public Works if they could maybe comment on the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| and safety issues for five individual driveways in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| Again, it doesn't reduce the development impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| And really, the grading is going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| You're going to have more pavement, at least equal pavement, because you're doing two-lane roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| And then you have to have the houses that have the shared access closer together with the topography change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| That's a whole other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| So you're adding a lot of complexities really when you're not gaining anything in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4810)|
| 1:20:19| You know, there's concern about, you know, there might be backup for vehicles on this area or cars backing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| I mean, Mr. Reynolds talked about because of the 20-foot setback for the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| plus the 23 feet of additional right-of-way from edge of pavement to the lot lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| you have an abnormally long driveway that can accommodate that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| And if you have proper landings at the top, people are going to be driving in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| Mr. Kline discussed safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| We had Mr. Gray last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| He provided turn templates to show that, yes, you can safely access this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| and larger vehicles can safely access these lots with the width of the road and with those medium brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| Those medium brakes are there for a specific reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| They're there to allow there to be access to single-family homes on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| or I'm sorry, the west side of Mission Hills Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| And beyond that, that was always intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| When you look at the revised concept plan for Massey Creek, which is February 11, 2016, file number 2-SC-16-C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| and that's one of the things I handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| On the second page, this plan says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| it has been determined that the stub-out street would not be needed since the right-of-way for Road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| which is now Mission Hills Lane, would allow for street connections to the adjoining properties to the east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| So they're talking about not only the property that we're talking about here for the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| but for the property on the other side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| So it was always intended that this is a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| It's not a private JPE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| It's a public road that there would be access to both properties to the east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4916)|
| 1:22:03| The one to the west is the property that we're discussing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| I see I have 10 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| I could ask somebody from county engineering to comment on whether the Condition 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| and having this shared access instead of five individual driveways really has any meaningful impact on safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| or on access or if there's any concern about the driveway access to Mission Hills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| Does Knox County want to respond to that request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| And I might let Mike kind of fill in the gaps here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| I believe a large majority of why we got together after the last Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| to talk about access for these five lots was a result of some of the concerns that this body kind of raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| with the access in light of some of the folks from the community asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| So I think in light of all of that, the shared driveways, I think we can go either way on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4979)|
| 1:23:07| I think it provides a little bit of additional safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| but I think the big thing for us is going to be those turnarounds on the driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| because we have less than that 26-foot that we would typically see on a residential street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=4993)|
| 1:23:20| That 26-foot is a standard that we use everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| But we have allowed in other subdivisions throughout the county for lots like this to be adjacent to a boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| so it's not terribly out of character with any other location that we see in the county that has a boulevard similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5010)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Could I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| I'll give you 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| It's completely out of character because it's so unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| Westmoreland, Sequoia Hills, they were all designed to have this kind of curb cut, to have this kind of entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| This wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| It wasn't designed for it, and the break in it, as Mr. Mullins just said, was for connectivity, not for driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5039)|
| 1:24:08| This is unsafe, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| Don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Well, to be completely honest with what I'm thinking, I think this is kind of a silly discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| We're looking at a public roadway with five driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| Engineers are saying it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| We have an opinion that it's not safe, but we have engineers to tell us otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| and these houses have a right to access that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| There's no ordinances against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| Additionally, the road is not owned by the subdivision, so I think that, to Mr. Mullins' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5086)|
| 1:24:55| if the subdivision back there wanted to restrict access to that roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5095)|
| 1:25:04| then they should have kept it as a private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| I don't know if it ever was, but that's not really my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| My point is it's a public road, so I would be completely in favor of the original request of five driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5113)|
| 1:25:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5122)|
| 1:25:30| Normally when we get into discussions with the Commission, that's when the public comments kind of cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| If you've got a question, Commissioner, please ask it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| Well, I was absolutely a voice concerned last month about these driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| and about the kind of peculiar scenario that they bring in because it's so irregular for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5148)|
| 1:25:58| and my questioning voice is because of the document that Mr. Mullins handed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5158)|
| 1:26:06| that's saying that that road is public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| It's not the Massey subdivision's property, which I'm not going to lie, it is a kludgy kind of way to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5172)|
| 1:26:25| but I think that it's a legal way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5185)|
| 1:26:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| I did drive out there the other day, and I initially had some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| and was able to do a U-turn there on the drive and access the properties if I needed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5201)|
| 1:26:49| and I was also concerned about parcel delivery, but now with the way everything's logistically set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| they're going to go through the neighborhood first and then come back out and serve those five properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| so I'm not as concerned with that as I once was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| The other issue, I'd rather have five homes built on an existing public street rather than building another street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| That just costs additional money to maintain long term, so personally I support the effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| and I think the plan makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| I don't think it's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| I drove in there and didn't see a car the whole time I was there, so I'm not that concerned with safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| I'm concerned about safety, but I don't see it being an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| Yeah, and I hate to get down too far in the weeds, but whoever's running this big screen here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| can you go to KJS and put Shoreham Boulevard on there and do an area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| S-H-O-R-E-H-A-M Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| The reason I wanted to make sure that there was a precedence that we have done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| I think the county brought it up, but I wanted just to make sure myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5280)|
| 1:28:09| Shoreham, S-H-O-R-E-H-A-M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| Mr. Kline represented Council of West Knox homeowners for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| and I have a lot of respect for Mr. Kline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| and this area of Ebenezer Road was kind of right in the core of everything they ever did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| And so I went out there the other day and just kind of drove around just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| And all those old subdivisions, Farmington and Bennington and every one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| if you go on up towards the north a little bit farther,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| you know, the pool, Bennington Pool is right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| Colchester Ridge, down just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| Yeah, right there, Colchester Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| That's where their pool is, and there's houses that are on the boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| and it's all up and down through Ebenezer Road with just a ton of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| Those subdivisions are 400 or 500 houses back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| And I really, I hate it for the homeowners because I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| I mean, you think that's your entrance and maintain it and manicured it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| and I would be upset, too. I really would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| But I think, as Commissioner Phillips said, it's a county right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| and it's just hard to say no to something that's got public access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| that we've done things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| And I can't imagine that there's been a bunch of traffic incidents out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| in Bennington and Farrington and Farmington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Those subdivisions have been there for 30, 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| So that's the only reason I would be okay with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| because I know we've got this all over town in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| You mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| But I can get away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| I appreciate your comments, Commissioner Uten and Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| Actually, the comment I'm going to make has nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| That's why I was kind of deferring to Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| But I was looking, and I apologize for the late notice on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| My question is actually for Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| I was looking at the map, and I talked to staff today, to Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| and I noticed that, you know, all this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| the area surrounding it is also PR under three volume units per unit, per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| And there's a big swath of land that's probably also maybe going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| developed residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| We talked about the fact that Knox County has a proposed greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| just to the north, northwest, the Connor Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5432)|
| 1:30:39| which is on the very backside of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| And so my request is whether the applicant would be willing to allow a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| 10-foot common area strip off of one of the properties for the cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| so that in the future, when that greenway is developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| that the owners of that property and surrounding areas could have an access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5459)|
| 1:31:08| I believe the tying into the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| providing a greenway easement on the final plot of the south side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Connor Creek is one that's condition six on this, on our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| It was something that was discussed and approved at the prior concept plan in 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5481)|
| 1:31:28| where we had the plan approved without this additional piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| in these five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| And that was something that tied into what you're on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| the HOP subdivision approval, which was also done about the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| I think actually the same month, in September of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| So, yeah, that greenway easement and access, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| is to be provided at the final plot stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| And that's one of the conditions for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| That sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Is that what we were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I think what she was asking then was if at the end of the cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| if there could be a common area strip that goes back towards the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| so that the future residents wouldn't have to walk out to Arden Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| and then over to Mission Hill and around in order to access the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| That's right on the north side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| If that has been explored or anything yet, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| I don't know if it has, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I mean, my client had to step out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| so I haven't had a chance to discuss that with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| But I don't think, you know, that, I mean, if there's a greenway there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| that we would want the residents to be able to access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| That would be one of the amenities and a selling point that we would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| have for if people want to move into that area, they have greenway access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| So I don't think that's going to be an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| but that's something we could continue to discuss with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| as we move towards final plot approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5578)|

| 1:35:55| planning commission approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5755)|

| 1:36:13| because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5773)|

| 1:36:55| Would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5815)|

| 1:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Opposition, would you like to come up to the podium, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| and state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| You'll have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| My name is Alan Chase, and I live at 7824 Staley Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| My property borders this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| I have four acres of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| and I have 900 feet of property line that borders this subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| as you can see on the map there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to express my concerns to this concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| The plans show 16 lots laid out next to my property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5854)|
| 1:37:43| My house lies 150 feet from this property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| My barn lies 10 feet from this property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| I've lived at my residence for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| I live on four acres of land at the end of a dead-end street for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| because I value my privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| As you can see, having 16 new neighbors next to my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| will greatly affect the quality of my life and diminish my property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| I attended the last county commissioner meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| and I spoke up about my opposition to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| I asked that there be large lot buffers provided to all adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5896)|
| 1:38:22| There are 27 acres of land set aside on the Campbell's Point side of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5902)|
| 1:38:30| Right now, it is not being used for the subdivided lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| Surely this land could be subdivided and divvied up to provide a buffer for all the area residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| not just for the Campbell's Point property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| Other subdivisions have been built by this company with considerate buffers provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| The subdivision in Shannon Valley is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| They have buffers all around the subdivided land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| plus they put in Leland cypress trees to buffer the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5937)|
| 1:39:04| This is the first subdivision of this type to be developed in a rural Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| and it will set precedence for other future developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| I'm asking for protection not only for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| but for other property owners that may face this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| I asked the planning committee to request the builder to provide protection to existing property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| and set design standards for future developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| I believe that with over 70 acres of land for this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| that it could be divided out to provide proper protection to the adjacent residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| Thank you for hearing my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| Thank you, Mr. Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| Mr. Sanderson, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| Completely understand Mr. Chase wanting to protect his property, his property value and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=5999)|
| 1:40:07| With two units an acre, we had to get very creative how we laid this subdivision out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| One of the first things I asked our engineer to do is on the south property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| or technically the west property line where it borders Mr. Chase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| to make those as deep as we can make them, but still get the two roads in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| So we normally build a 55-foot wide lot 100-foot deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| These lots are actually 130 feet deep with the 35-foot peripheral setback on the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| I also, as a consideration, agreed to plant Leland Cypresses along those 16 lots that border him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| This just came to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| We can further restrict those 16 lots that border him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| Restrict 35 feet, no outbuildings, no improvements, no clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| and leave that as a buffer to protect his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| As far as the design, again, we had to get creative with the two-unit breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| I think this will set the precedent for Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| I think it's a good layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| I think a lot of people will want to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| I think it's going to be a very desirable community for Knox County and the Gibbs area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| As far as staff, we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| I did talk to Ms. Brooks and Mr. Reynolds about item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| They wanted a stub out to the farm to the north, and I understand why they want connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| Instead of us building a stub out, we agreed to, before we final plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| leave two or three lots, however many lots we need, to label it future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| and possibly have a stub out if that land becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| They said they didn't have any opposition to that, but I'll let them speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| Again, done everything with the exception of not developing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| In my opinion, we've done everything to appease Mr. Chase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| and are willing to listen to any more recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| Other than that, I ask the commission to approve this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| with the exception of item number seven being admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Mr. Reynolds, do you want to respond to item number seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| Is there a change in the staff's recommendation on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| Well, I guess I created some potential language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| If the Planning Commission did want to amend the condition number seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| the current condition would require a true right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| which if the property that it leads to was ever to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| would have clear ability to connect to the internal roads here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| and that would be permanent unless the county eventually closed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| If the adjacent property developed and didn't connect to that right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| then there would be no reason to maintain that right-of-way over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| But the revised or the optional condition reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6185)|
| 1:43:15| and I'll leave this up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| The first part of this talks about two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| Mr. Sanderson mentioned that maybe three lots might be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| So really the number of lots, which lots are not important necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| We can hash that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| But it says lots 50 and 51 shall be shown on the final plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| as reserved for future right-of-way per Section 3.04.C.2.B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| If a concept plan is not approved for the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| or the adjacent property to the north utilizing the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| within five years of this approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| the reservation shall expire and the lots able to be built upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| This condition shall be included on the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| One comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| One, thank you, Mr. Reynolds, for being open to our suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| The only thing I heard, you did narrow it down to two specific lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| My only problem with that is that lot, the property next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| I don't know if there's a sinkhole, a lake, or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Can we make it more broad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| Yes, that's why I was saying I put two specific lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| We don't really study on it or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| We don't know how it lays out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| so we'll know where we tie into that farm if we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| And another thing, if I own that farm next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| I don't want my neighbor putting a road in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| and saying this is where you're going to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| when they don't even know what I'm going to be doing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| So just my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| Yes, I think we could probably amend it to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| during design plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| two to three lots would be reserved to make a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| to the adjacent property to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| Something along those lines that would allow some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| on how that gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| So you don't know which two or three lots it would be yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| It wouldn't be straight at the end of Road A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I just picked the ones at the end of Road A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| because it seemed like a logical place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| but it doesn't really necessarily have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| It could be on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| I mean, it would be ideal for that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| to have a four-way stop right there and just go into it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| But I have no idea what that farm looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| I think that one concern that I have is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| we're sort of planning and hoping to build a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| that's connected via roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| and we're putting a sidewalk on just one section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| And if it does ever connect in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| we're going to be having a subdivision that you also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| it might have sidewalk in it in the future time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| And so you're going to be walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| and then you might connect to this empty sidewalk part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| and then you get back on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| And so I think if we're going to plan for a stub out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| we should plan for also requiring a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| up to where that would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| And so I'd say I'd like to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| potentially after discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| requiring a sidewalk for the entirety of Road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| following the entirety of Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| If you don't mind, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| I'd like Mr. Snowden to weigh in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| because I know there's some issues with sidewalks in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| approving the requiring sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| So, Mr. Snowden, could you respond to the Commissioner's comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| Yeah, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| Yeah, the county does have an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| We would need to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| How many lots are on Road A currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| Forty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Forty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| So our ordinance is codified such that any subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| or any road within an interior subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| that has greater than 1,000 trips a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| is required to have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| So based on the number of lots here currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| it necessarily wouldn't meet that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| Now, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| If the road did get extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| it has a possibility to meeting that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| So it would be a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| But for us, with the unknown of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| we would prefer not to have sidewalks on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| from the county's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| Seeing no other comments from Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| Chair will entertain a motion on the alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6464)|
| 1:47:53| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| I'm not sure I know how to make this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Well, I mean, we're on the alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| one through three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| We're just doing the alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| I'll make a motion to approve the alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| one through three, per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| second by Commissioner Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| to approve the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Chair will entertain a motion on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| subject to 16 condition, incorrect, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| changing condition number seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| per what Mr. Reynolds had stated earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| regarding the future extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| I'd like to make a motion that we do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| I don't know that I can repeat what Mr. Reynolds said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| I think it's dealing with the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| and dealing with the right-of-way on the three lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Our intent is to have a right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| not necessarily a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| somewhere located for future connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| Does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| I think we're talking about reserving up to two to three lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| for future roadway development within a five-year time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Is there a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| I'll second it, but the only reason I'm doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| is because I had a bet that Jeff wouldn't have to say anything today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| and I lost the bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6568)|

| 1:50:20| We do have, this will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| We have variances, alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| concept plan and development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| with peripheral setback reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| File is 2SC22C and 2E22UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| The subdivision is Loy Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| The developer is Eagle Bend LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| Location, southeast side of South North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| north of Chota Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| Acreage is 11.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| Zoning is PR Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| Proposed use, attached and detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| Number of lots, 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| We have required variances, three of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| and we do have alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| requiring planning commission approval, four of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| Staff recommendation, approve variances one and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| as recommended by staff in alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6677)|

| 1:51:24| of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| because the site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| and will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| Deny variance two based on the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| Staff recommends approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| subject to 14 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| Also, staff recommends approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| for up to 56, I'm sorry, 57 attached and detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| residential houses on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| and the peripheral setback reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| from 35 feet to 25 feet along South North Shore Drive frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| You'd like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| You want the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| Opposition, if you want to come up to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| and you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| My name is Gary Verholik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| I live at 1628 Choteau Meadows Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| Choteau Meadows is approximately a quarter mile south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| of this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| and there are three issues that cause concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| The first is stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| The 57 dwellings are going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| and the roads will take up more than 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| of the available land mass there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| which means there'll be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| five acres of impervious surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| This is going to increase the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| We're downstream from this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| and I live right on Holder Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| That floods frequently during the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| even without this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| but it shows here that the drainage is supposed to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| to a detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| and we believe it has to come downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| so it has to come to a small stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| going down to Holder Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| The stream is in between a storage unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| and the Wigles facility off of North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| The number of units in there is too high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| for this kind of runoff issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| and we'd like to see that it be lowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| The second issue is traffic on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| I've lived out in that area for some 44 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| and I've watched it grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| and it's to be expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| but it needs to grow at a reasonable pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| I've been told for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| that that North Shore was going to be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| It's never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| I don't know that I'll see it in my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| The number of vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| if you take 1.5 vehicles per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| or two vehicles per unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| it's somewhere between 85 and 115| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| that are going to be dumped onto North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| If you're ever out in North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| during the rush hour traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| the backup of traffic can be miles long already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| Again, reducing the number of dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| would relieve that to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| One of the residents I spoke with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| voiced concern about the safety in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| The roadways are narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| With that many homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| there's going to be on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| That's going to cause issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| with emergency vehicles coming and going in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6913)|
| 1:55:20| The request here that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| is that the Planning Commission revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| the density of the dwellings in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6924)|
| 1:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| Just a comment real quick, Mr. Verhollich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| In November 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| properties rezoned for five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| This layout complies with that minimum requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6954)|

| 1:56:03| We have addressed the water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| To the west of us, adjacent, is John Huber's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| which is a storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| We think this is a perfect transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| from the storage facility to the townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| We are within the density requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| and we're going to work with Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| on any of the runoff that goes to the east toward the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| We're going to work with the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| on connecting to that on some of the stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| they're already working on for drainage on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| So Mr. Huber is working with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| on drainage coming onto his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| on the storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| We're within our density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| and I would respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| that you all approve as per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| Chair recognizes Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Yeah, I was curious about the denial of variance request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| on the pavement width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| I have been working on this with Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| for several years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| mostly on public roads, not private roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| about requiring 26-foot-wide roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| and trying to narrow them down a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| so we don't have so much impervious surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| and have more water quality and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| And since this is a private road with a gated community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| what's the reason for the denial of the 24?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| I can help address that, Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| The denial recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| is for one of the vertical curve variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| Not the pavement width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| No, the pavement width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| is an alternative design standard, number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Gotcha. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| I just want to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| because as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| you did approve or recommend approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| for the design for the width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| It was just a 1K factor for the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| Yes, 24-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7065)|
| 1:57:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| Seeing no other comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| Chair will entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| on approving the alternative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| and variances and alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Approve variances one and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| as recommended by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| and alternative design standards one through four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| based on the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| Because the site conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| restrict compliance with subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| it will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7096)|

| 1:58:25| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7107)|

| 1:58:38| You're not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| Almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7121)|

| 1:58:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| Chair will entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| subject to 14 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| seconded by Commissioner Perez| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7142)|

| 1:59:11| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7155)|
| 1:59:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| For clarification purposes on the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| it should be approved variances one and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| not one through three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Now, they've got in here deny variance two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| Mr. Reynolds, can you enlighten us, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| with a recommendation to deny variance two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| Well, that was a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| by Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| The requested K value was less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| than they would desire for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| So that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| So we are not approving variance two on the K value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7217)|
| 2:00:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| The motion was stated correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| as was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| I just want to simply clarify the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220210?start=7232)|
