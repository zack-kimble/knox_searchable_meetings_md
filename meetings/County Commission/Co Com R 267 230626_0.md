| 0:01:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=93.0)|
| 0:01:34| Thank you, Commissioner Lee, for this opportunity and invitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=94.0)|
| 0:01:37| and thank you for a commission that would entertain the importance of prayer before your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=97.0)|
| 0:01:45| I have a great deal of appreciation for that, and I thank you for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=105.0)|
| 0:01:48| I would also like to thank these honored gentlemen in uniform behind me that have given what they've given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=108.0)|
| 0:01:53| so that I can have the privilege under the rights given of God to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=113.0)|
| 0:01:58| I want to warn you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=118.0)|
| 0:02:00| I have had a week to pray about what I'm going to pray about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=120.0)|
| 0:02:04| and in praying about it, I found out that there is a county commissioner in the Old Testament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=124.0)|
| 0:02:10| and in the capacity that Nehemiah served as the cupbearer to Artaxerxes, he was very much like you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=130.0)|
| 0:02:18| and he was very much in need of folks to support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=138.0)|
| 0:02:22| In his time, his community, his name in and of itself means the comfort of God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=142.0)|
| 0:02:29| and he was appointed in that time to be a leader out of an exile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=149.0)|
| 0:02:36| and his heart was burdened for his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=156.0)|
| 0:02:39| It was so burdened he went back to Jerusalem to find the walls of that city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=159.0)|
| 0:02:44| once a great and mighty fortress destroyed and laying asunder on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=164.0)|
| 0:02:49| and he was broken before the Lord because of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=169.0)|
| 0:02:53| and the Lord strengthened him to do something quite miraculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=173.0)|
| 0:02:57| What it took almost 90 years to build, which the enemy had torn down in a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=177.0)|
| 0:03:03| he was able to organize his community to rebuild in 52 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=183.0)|
| 0:03:08| and he did so by arming the people with a consciousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=188.0)|
| 0:03:13| and it's impossible to do what you do and legislate morality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=193.0)|
| 0:03:17| but it is possible for you to build again on the bedrock of who we are as Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=197.0)|
| 0:03:22| Knox County, Tennessee, a once again flourishing and mighty community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=202.0)|
| 0:03:28| We are people of industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=208.0)|
| 0:03:29| We are people of fortitude and morality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=209.0)|
| 0:03:33| and what Nehemiah was able to accomplish is he took those people back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=213.0)|
| 0:03:37| and he said this is who we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=217.0)|
| 0:03:39| and it's quite ironic that we're invited to be here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=219.0)|
| 0:03:42| in lieu of the fact I have an out-of-town guest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=222.0)|
| 0:03:45| and I had to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=225.0)|
| 0:03:46| He came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=226.0)|
| 0:03:47| He's my best friend from Naples, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=227.0)|
| 0:03:49| never been to East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=229.0)|
| 0:03:50| and I had planned all these things to show him about who we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=230.0)|
| 0:03:53| why we're the volunteer state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=233.0)|
| 0:03:55| why we are the people that have been mocked in media with the snuffy smiths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=235.0)|
| 0:04:00| and the he-haw characters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=240.0)|
| 0:04:02| Man, we are an awesome community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=242.0)|
| 0:04:05| and you are charged by that community to lead us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=245.0)|
| 0:04:08| and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=248.0)|
| 0:04:10| so I want to pray the prayer of Nehemiah for you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=250.0)|
| 0:04:13| He was as a representative of his community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=253.0)|
| 0:04:19| and as a man of God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=259.0)|
| 0:04:21| tasked with keeping that community tightly knit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=261.0)|
| 0:04:25| He was tasked with rebuilding that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=265.0)|
| 0:04:28| and what it once was to greater than it had ever been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=268.0)|
| 0:04:33| and you have that burden upon your shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=273.0)|
| 0:04:36| and I don't envy that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=276.0)|
| 0:04:38| even though until about two weeks ago I was running for one of these seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=278.0)|
| 0:04:42| I don't envy that because it is a burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=282.0)|
| 0:04:45| to look with an open heart upon this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=285.0)|
| 0:04:48| and see what we're under the duress of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=288.0)|
| 0:04:51| what we're under the influence of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=291.0)|
| 0:04:53| I don't want to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=293.0)|
| 0:04:54| I want to see instead, through you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=294.0)|
| 0:04:57| what God would have us to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=297.0)|
| 0:04:59| so let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=299.0)|
| 0:05:00| Father, we're thankful for this opportunity to be here in this commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=300.0)|
| 0:05:05| and Lord, I pray that you would be abiding with your Holy Spirit upon them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=305.0)|
| 0:05:08| Lead, guide, and direct them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=308.0)|
| 0:05:10| There's folks out here in these hills and these hollers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=310.0)|
| 0:05:12| that are still in dire need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=312.0)|
| 0:05:15| and a lot of our constitution of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=315.0)|
| 0:05:18| of who we are in this valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=318.0)|
| 0:05:20| is being compromised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=320.0)|
| 0:05:22| and Lord God, the enemy would love to sit and do a dance today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=322.0)|
| 0:05:26| on the walls of a crumbled city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=326.0)|
| 0:05:28| but instead, Lord God, I pray that you would gather them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=328.0)|
| 0:05:31| one in mind and one in heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=331.0)|
| 0:05:33| to lead the people of the Knox County community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=333.0)|
| 0:05:37| back to its roots in you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=337.0)|
| 0:05:41| and our fundamental identity of who we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=341.0)|
| 0:05:45| who we're still stereotyped as, God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=345.0)|
| 0:05:47| who we're still ridiculed as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=347.0)|
| 0:05:49| I celebrate that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=349.0)|
| 0:05:51| and I pray a word of hope over them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=351.0)|
| 0:05:53| that all the businesses conducted in this session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=353.0)|
| 0:05:56| and those that are to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=356.0)|
| 0:05:57| I pray, Lord, that it would draw us closer as a community to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=357.0)|
| 0:06:01| that we would see the needfulness of our neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=361.0)|
| 0:06:04| and Lord God, that we would most importantly see our needfulness of you and your guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=364.0)|
| 0:06:09| And this is not the kingdom in which we live for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=369.0)|
| 0:06:12| The kingdom in which we live for is that above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=372.0)|
| 0:06:15| and we praise you for that hopeful promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=375.0)|
| 0:06:18| that you've given through the shed blood of your son, Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=378.0)|
| 0:06:21| I beg your forgiveness, Lord God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=381.0)|

| 0:10:49| to use until they were able to obtain their own M1 rifles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=649.0)|

| 0:12:41| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=761.0)|
| 0:12:44| Please show your appreciation to these men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=764.0)|
| 0:12:47| I'm going to ask Mr. Stewart-Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=767.0)|
| 0:13:02| Just like so, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=782.0)|
| 0:13:04| It's very humbling for us to even be recognized in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=784.0)|
| 0:13:11| As the pastor said there a while ago, we are a state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=791.0)|
| 0:13:15| we are a community of volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=795.0)|
| 0:13:18| and every day I get to work with approximately 40 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=798.0)|
| 0:13:23| men, women, officers, enlisted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=803.0)|
| 0:13:26| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=806.0)|
| 0:13:27| We're out doing what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=807.0)|
| 0:13:30| We are volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=810.0)|
| 0:13:32| No one gets paid for what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=812.0)|
| 0:13:35| And when he said that, that sums up who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=815.0)|
| 0:13:42| And I hadn't realized that until he spoke that prayer a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=822.0)|
| 0:13:47| that that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=827.0)|
| 0:13:48| We are a volunteer community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=828.0)|
| 0:13:51| And because of that, as Commissioner Fraser said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=831.0)|
| 0:13:56| we're called on approximately 300 and something times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=836.0)|
| 0:13:59| 350 times a year to do a military funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=839.0)|
| 0:14:05| As you can tell, we're not very young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=845.0)|
| 0:14:08| So it pushes us quite a bit to do what we do, but we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=848.0)|
| 0:14:16| But, again, I want to thank each and every one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=856.0)|
| 0:14:19| especially these two here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=859.0)|
| 0:14:21| They have been very encouraging to me over the years in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=861.0)|
| 0:14:26| Again, I just want to thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=866.0)|
| 0:14:34| Standing over, hold your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=874.0)|

| 0:25:31| I'm now going to turn it over to our parks and rec director, Mr. Joe Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1531.68)|

| 0:25:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1540.5200000000002)|
| 0:25:42| So I'm not going to torture you with the whereases that are in this resolution, but I did want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1542.96)|
| 0:25:52| to take the opportunity to recognize the hardworking people in the Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1552.04)|
| 0:25:58| Department of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1558.32)|
| 0:26:01| When I took this job almost two years ago, one of the things that I wanted everyone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1561.2)|
| 0:26:08| be aware of is just how dedicated and the quality of the people in the Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1568.72)|
| 0:26:16| Department here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1576.08)|
| 0:26:18| So I made it my personal, I guess you would say, project to make sure that we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1578.96)|
| 0:26:29| these Park and Recreation Months annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1589.32)|
| 0:26:34| So every year, I'll be back up here asking you and thanking you for this resolution so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1594.28)|
| 0:26:41| that we could take just a few minutes out of this very important meeting today to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1601.64)|
| 0:26:48| the hardworking people behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1608.52)|
| 0:26:53| These are the people that, I guess they're the straws that stir the drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1613.32)|
| 0:27:01| But I will mention a little bit from this resolution, the U.S. House of Representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1621.72)|
| 0:27:07| has designated July as Parks and Recreation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1627.44)|
| 0:27:11| And that's done for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1631.96)|
| 0:27:15| I think what we do, and this is a national thing, is I think we underestimate the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1635.0)|
| 0:27:22| of parks and recreation in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1642.56)|
| 0:27:26| So people move to communities all over the country for certain reasons, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1646.04)|
| 0:27:33| Maybe it's a state may not have any income tax, similar to Tennessee, or maybe there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1653.12)|
| 0:27:43| great school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1663.64)|
| 0:27:46| But for someone who has moved several times over the course of my, I guess, careers, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1666.2800000000002)|
| 0:27:53| would say, and let me put it in perspective for you a little bit, when I got to Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1673.5200000000002)|
| 0:28:01| my youngest daughter had been to 10 different elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1681.4)|
| 0:28:05| So I have a little bit of experience with moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1685.64)|
| 0:28:08| But I will tell you that everywhere I go, one of the first things I look for is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1688.48)|
| 0:28:15| community and what the community offers with regards to recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1695.72)|
| 0:28:19| So as we have this large influx of people moving into Knox County, I just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1699.8)|
| 0:28:25| sure that this group, and I know you are, are aware that one of the reasons that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1705.76)|
| 0:28:30| moving to this area is because of the recreation opportunities available here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1710.16)|
| 0:28:35| And the people behind me that manage our 52 parks, 52 and growing parks, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1715.72)|
| 0:28:42| do a wonderful job and they're dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1722.96)|
| 0:28:45| They love what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1725.16)|
| 0:28:47| And today is one of the days during the month and the month of July that we want to celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1727.0)|
| 0:28:54| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1734.92)|
| 0:28:55| So that's what this is actually all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1735.92)|
| 0:28:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1737.92)|

| 0:30:43| We have seen month after month multiple agenda items come before Knox Planning, and none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1843.88)|
| 0:30:50| of the commissioners who are voting on this, who make approvals or make suggestions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1850.28)|

| 0:31:08| of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=1868.8)|
