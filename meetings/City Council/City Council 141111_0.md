| 0:00:00| Good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here. This is the Knoxville City Council on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=0)|
| 0:00:13| Tuesday, November 11, 2014. We appreciate you being here and anyone who might be watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=13)|
| 0:00:19| us on TV. We'll begin with the invocation, which will be given by Councilman Campin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=19)|
| 0:00:26| and the Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=26)|
| 0:00:32| We gather tonight grateful for another day, another chance to serve our city and its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| Let us be thankful for our many blessings and ever mindful for those less fortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=37)|
| 0:00:41| those without a home, without friends or family. On this Veterans Day, we're forever indebted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| to our servicemen and women. Let us give thanks to all those who serve and have served in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=47)|
| 0:00:52| our armed forces and the many people who died protecting our freedom and our human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| rights throughout the world. Please be with all our uniformed officers and firemen as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| they risk their lives to protect us in Knoxville. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| Remembering the veterans and their families, let us pledge. I pledge allegiance to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=66)|
| 0:01:11| flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=71)|
| 0:01:18| under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=78)|
| 0:01:26| Please call the roll, Ms. Mitchell. Councilman Brown. Here. Councilman Campin. Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| Dela Volpe. Here. Councilman Grieve. Here. Councilwoman Palmer. Here. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| Here. Councilman Saunders. Here. Councilman Steyer. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| We are all here tonight. Is there a motion to approve the minutes? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The minutes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| approved. Are there any items to be withdrawn? I wish. Items for postponement? Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| Campin. Thank you, Mayor. Yeah, just came to my attention the item, let's see, is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| E, I believe there's three items there related to rezoning on Cedar Lane, E, F, and G, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=129)|
| 0:02:20| been asked to postpone for four weeks. And I would like to make that motion. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| Okay, we have a motion and a second. Is there any discussion? Councilman Dela Volpe. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| have a brief set of remarks. I know there are people here to speak to this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| but, you know, the concern that this raises in some quarters is legally can this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=157)|
| 0:02:47| give someone a zone and then say some parts of it are not effective? I mean, we have powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| as a council to impose reasonable restrictions, but the MPC file that came to us attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| to take away parts of the ordinance and make them non-effective, and I think we're on thin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| ice. And I hope that if we're going to postpone for four weeks, and I don't have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| with that, that we seriously look at the legality of what's being recommended to us and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| if this is not only prudent, but even lawful. Sure. Well, I feel the same way, and believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| me, I've looked into it thoroughly and was ready to discuss it, but it's been requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| that they want to talk to the Planning Commission and see if anything can change before it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| before us. Council, several people signed up to speak, and I see our former Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| Malone would like to speak now, so if there's no objection, I'd like to invite her to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| this. Will both sides speak? If they would like to, yes. Okay, and this is speaking specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| to the motion to postpone. Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, on behalf of Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| City Town Hall. A four-week postponement puts it right before Christmas, and really, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| at some point, give us a break, okay? We've been to MPC, we've been dealing with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| right before Christmas. I'm not going to be in town, and that doesn't mean the world stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| and I understand the clock is ticking, but what we requested at MPC and will request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| again is that the matter not just be postponed. We're not interested in getting rid of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| rights of the petitioner, but send it back to MPC so the clock doesn't continue running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| and so that we're not here on Christmas Eve with all of you. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Does the other side wish to address it as well? Again, on the motion to postpone. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| would be for December 9th meeting. I have no objection. Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| Oh, excuse me. Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| behalf of Cindy Bradley. I have no objection. I just don't want to run into the 120-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| rule we did previously, and I want to have an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Frost and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=302)|
| 0:05:10| Mr. Swanson what MPC's position is and discuss with their attorney also. Mark, is it 120| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=310)|
| 0:05:22| days? From when? October 9th. Anybody got a quick calendar? Didn't that put us into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| January or February, Mr. Seymour? January. Can you do the math real quick? I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=330)|
| 0:05:40| my calendar with me. January. Certainly early January. Let's see. The MPC hearing was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=340)|
| 0:05:49| October 9th, so November 9th, December 9th, December 9th, December 9th, December 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=349)|
| 0:05:59| December 9th. If we could have it the first meeting in January, that would still get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| under the 120 days, would it not? I'm fine with that. You could have it even the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| We think it might be February. Well, I don't want to run up against the clock if we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| help that. I'm fine with that. It's an important issue, and if they need time to, if Carleen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| won't be here and she wants to be present, then I'm certainly willing to go to January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| if that's the request. January? January 6th. I'm sure Arthur would love Carleen to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| No, she's going to Florence, so I think, aren't you? This is a meeting you don't want to miss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| so let's make sure they can both be here. In all fairness, Mr. Seymour, I think is trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| to be kind and fair on this matter. Thank you. Well, I'm going with her. She just told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| me she was going to Florence. Okay, so we have a motion to postpone this to, is it January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| 6th? Is that the right date? You'll be back, Carleen, as a council date. As a council date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| to January 6th, 2015. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Let's take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? That passes, so we'll see you both January 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| 2015. Anything else to be postponed? Thanks to everybody else who came for that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| Anything else to be postponed? Anything to be added by motion? Our consent items are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| 11I, Certificate of Compliance, and 12J through L, 202s. Move. Second. We'll have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=453)|
| 0:07:42| and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| For the Mayor's Report, there's several events I need to tell you about, but I want to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| by again recognizing that this is Veterans Day. Thank you to Councilman Campin and Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| Saunders for already mentioning that. Many of us were at the parade today. It was a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| outstanding parade. So many people participated. A lot of people were there to enjoy it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| well and to pay tribute publicly to the men and women who have served in our nation's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| military, and it was a great day to honor them. Also the families who have sacrificed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| a lot as well. Anybody in the room who may be veterans, we certainly want to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| and appreciate your service. I know we have two City Council members who are veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Councilman Saunders and former Mayor Brown, and also Chief Roush is a veteran as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| So thank you all. Is there any other veterans in the audience? Please stand up. We want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| to recognize you as well. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, so this Friday, November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=525)|
| 0:08:58| 14th at 2.30 p.m., there will be a ribbon cutting at Chilhowee Park for a new playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| This is the project organized by MUSE, the Children's Discovery Center at Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| along with the City of Knoxville and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee. It is a Kaboom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| Playground, which is a name you might be familiar with. Kaboom is a national nonprofit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| that organizes volunteers to build creative community playgrounds. So this build will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| take place on Friday, and it will be finished by the afternoon. It has to be finished by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| 2.30, because that's when we're cutting the ribbon. So it's going to be a great enhancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| to Chilhowee Park, adding yet another attraction for children and their families. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| Friday, November 14th at 2.30 at Chilhowee Park at the MUSE. Okay, and you might remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| that the City helped organize some events last winter to raise awareness about the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| to enroll in health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the open enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| for the coming year starts this Saturday, November 15th, and will run through February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| 15th of 2015. There will be several local events during that time, during those three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| months, where people can go and get trained assistance in filling out the forms and signing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| up for coverage if they choose and if they are eligible. The first one is this Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, 1807 Dandridge Avenue, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The full schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=624)|
| 0:10:32| of upcoming events is listed on the City's website at www.cityofknoxville.org slash Affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=632)|
| 0:10:41| Care Act. You can also call our City of Knoxville phone number, 311, and they will have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| lineup of all of the open enrollment events. So that starts this Saturday. Next Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=647)|
| 0:10:56| November 20th, we will have the second annual Startup Day in Knoxville. This is sponsored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| by the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center. Again, it's Thursday, November 20th. It starts at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| 2 p.m. at the Standard at 416 West Jackson Avenue, and it goes on for several hours because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| we have quite a few people who will be giving their pitch. So this is an event organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| by Knoxville Entrepreneur Center, along with several partners, and it's a great celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| of our local entrepreneurial community and also a great chance to hear some new ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| from some up-and-coming local businesses. And if you were at Startup Day last year like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| I was, I'm sure you were as impressed and inspired as all of us who were there by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| energy and the creativity in the room. And this year it's going to be even better. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| we encourage you to come. And you can find details about the event on the City website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| at StartupDay2014, all one word, StartupDay2014.com. Okay, so now we've got some, we want to highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=712)|
| 0:12:05| some of our City employees, our CAT employees. Last week, Knoxville was host to the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| conference of the Tennessee Public Transportation Association, TAPTA. And each year this also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| includes a bus rodeo, that's R-O-A-D-E-O, rodeo, where transit employees compete in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| several categories. And I'm very happy to report that Knoxville Area Transit did very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| well at the competition, which was held at Chilhowee Park. And I want to invite Don Disler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| our Transit Director, and your winning employees to come on down and tell us some more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| it. Oh, look at those awards. Put them up there so we can all see them. Yeah, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| good. That's great. We have three buses without steering wheels. We've got some running around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| out there now. Don Disler, Director of Transit, and this is a group that I am extremely proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| of, you know, for a couple of different reasons. One, they're just a great group to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| but these five people right here took home first place in the main categories of a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| rodeo. So they competed with over 40 other contestants and they came in first. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| the Big Wrench and our bus maintenance, which is Mike McCamus here, and we have our cutaway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| van first place, one of them over here, and we have our 35 foot bus first place, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=815)|
| 0:13:47| is Dean Prewitt here, and our 40 foot bus first place, which is Dean Jackson. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| competed with over 40 other contestants. And we have our bus maintenance, which is Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| McCamus here, and we have our cutaway van first place, one of them over here, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| which is Dean Pruitt here, and our 40-foot bus first place, which is Greg Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| And then on top of all that, we were lucky enough that Melissa Roberson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| who is our Chief Administrative Officer, actually received the award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| for the Executive Manager of the Year for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| So this is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Now, what makes this year sweeter for me is that last year when I was in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=861)|
| 0:14:42| Nashville took home all these awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| So this year I'm in Knoxville, and we brought them all home here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| So that made it even more fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| This is a great group to work with, and these are the people who fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| and drive the city of Knoxville around daily safely and provide a great service for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| And we're very proud of them, and we thank you for also letting us come and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you so much, Don, and thank you to all of you who won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I talked to a couple of you, I think a day or two before, at the opening reception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| and we had a lot of confidence going in, and I see that really paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| We're very proud of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| I just want to know if we burned any rubber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| Did we burn rubber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| And finally, we have some guests here who want to take just a few minutes to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| about a great local resource for parents and kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| The program is called MathLine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| It's on local TV every day, and Vicki Lawson and Ernie Roberts are here from East Tennessee PBS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| to tell us all about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| So why don't you all come on down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| Thank you, and good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| I'm Vicki Lawson, and I'm President and General Manager of East Tennessee PBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Our offices is located in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| One of our transmitters is located in the Knoxville area as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| with our second transmitter in Sneedville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| We cover all of East Tennessee, but Knoxville is our home, and we're so proud to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| So thank you so much for allowing us to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| We believe very strongly from cradle to grave education is one of the strongest initiatives that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| And with that resource and being a PBS resource, last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| four out of five kids in the U.S. ages 2 to 8 watched PBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| As the gap between rich and poor widens, our work to help all children get ready for school becomes even more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| Today's PBS has been voted number one in public trust and number one in educational media brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| PBS Kids reaches nearly 99% of TV's homes in the U.S.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| giving kids access to what may be their only source of educational resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| With that in mind, we did create a local show, which is called, under Tennessee Learn, called Mathline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| Ernie Roberts, who is the host of our show, is going to tell you just a little bit of that, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you for the opportunity to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| First of all, I recognize many of your faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Councilman Kaplan, you had to put up with me as a teacher in the classroom also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| And he did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| He did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| He was a good math student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| You were his teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Ernie, don't lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| And many others I know associated through the neighborhoods and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| which I've been a part of in the city of Knoxville for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Go back to my schooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| I'm a graduate of Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| I'm a proud Bobcat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| And also spent three, four years teaching at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| Went to Bearden High School, where people think I probably am going to be buried and put in a coffin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| But anyway, now I'm at PBS and still involved with the county school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| But in regards to what Vicki has said, the math part of our mission here at PBS came from Chris Smith, my producer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1080)|
| 0:18:11| coming and we've talked about this for about a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Could we do a math line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| I said, well, why would you, you know, other states do try to do homework hotlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| PBS regional groups have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| And I said, well, why are we looking at just math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| And he says, well, because when they did these homework hotlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| 90 to 95% of the questions that were asked wound up being math related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| Math classes from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| We try to do all the way from fourth grade all the way up through high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| It's very not unusual for me to work a trig problem with someone on the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| and then go right back and have someone who's working with fractions or decimals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| or even today multiplying whole numbers together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| The change is out there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| For example, I had two students from Knox County and they were actually within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| One was, I think, from Green Magnet and also one from Cedar Bluff in the elementary land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Then I had one also from Cumberland County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| So we are reaching all over East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| We have had probably close to, I think, between 16 and 18 counties now represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| by someone calling in and talking to me on the math line show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| So it's very exciting to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Again, it's just important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| The education aspect is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| And math we have deemed to become so important to anyone's success in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| They've got to have that basic background and also go beyond the basic background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| But you've got to literally crawl before you can walk and then walk before you can run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| But that's what we hope to be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| We're on from 6 to 6.30 on Monday through Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| It's a live call in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| On Friday we pick a theme topic and we run it for a 30-minute show on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| So we're five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Since coming on August 11, we have put now to this week we'll make 65 shows we put into the can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| so to speak, that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| Again, the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| It's from 6 to 6.30 each night, Monday through Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| Live call in on Monday through Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| And Friday night is a taped, we put some sort of a theme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| maybe fractions, decimals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| We're going to be moving up toward the algebra world and high school level stuff, too, along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Well, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| And I understand you also taught Aaron Frost, Rob's wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| It's a certain standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| So, again, thank you again for letting us have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| And you may also recognize his face as a singing and acting star from the Front Page Follies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| It's part of the Professional Journalist Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| You may have spoofed one of us up here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| You never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| It's entirely possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Yeah, I was just going to ask, could you do a special program on counting 120 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| I noticed we were having trouble with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| I think that comes out to a four-month schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| So move four months away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| I think February the 9th sounds like a good place that you could land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| You can call in tomorrow night, though, and he'll be able to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| It's a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Wednesday, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| I'll still be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you, Vicki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Thank you, Ernie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| So, Council, that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Are there any reports of Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I want to announce that on this Saturday, the 15th, there will be a Stop the Violence March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1285)|
| 0:21:34| People are concerned, are concerned of some drive-bys and other types of crimes that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| So there will be a nonviolent Stop the Violence March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| It's going to start at 1 o'clock at the Family Investment Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| and proceed to Eternal Life Church on Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| So I would like to invite anyone who wants to participate in that march to come and participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1322)|

| 0:25:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Mr. Melvede.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Yes, this sounds like a pretty neat project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| I wonder if Jim Hagerman can talk a little bit about it because it's sort of the tip of the iceberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| This is one project to sort of relieve bottlenecks and danger zones along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Do we have a five-year plan or a ten-year plan to work on this kind of connectivity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| This is Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| This particular section of Kingston Pike was chosen because it's part of a signed bike route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1539)|
| 0:25:49| So the signed bike route tries to avoid Kingston Pike, but at this location there wasn't an alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1549)|
| 0:25:59| and there really isn't much shoulder either, so it's a tight section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| It's also an area with a bus stop or two and a library and no pedestrian facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| and just across the street, more or less, is an REI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| So it is a focus of activity, and to your second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1575)|
| 0:26:23| we are working on a master plan for bike infrastructure throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| Let's see, we extended the deadline on the consultant's work until the end of December, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| So we have a draft list, but they're finalizing the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| Yeah, this one comes out pretty high, but it is a long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| Several of us were at a meeting last night in Fountain City where people were asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| the state was talking about the interchange up there on I-640 and Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and they clearly sort of laddled the ball to the city and said the city is going to have to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| and is handling that sort of passage through that internecine crossovers and flyovers and ramps and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1626)|
| 0:27:16| The state's design on that looks a lot better than it did when they first proposed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| but we are filling in some of the gaps with some sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| It's still going to be a work in progress long term to really make it comfortable for cycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| but it will be improved over what they had initially proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| and there's some related projects that are kind of in the hop or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| But your bottom line is that you are studying with the consultant's help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| which bottlenecks and areas we should be tackling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Yeah, we will have a priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| That is the main outcome of that study process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Just to follow up on that and to say I think this is a really well-deserving project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| and a really critical piece of connecting the greenways together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| So kudos to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Good luck to the city that we win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| For $50,000 we get nearly a million dollars worth of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| It's a big project, and it's a really, really critical piece of connecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| I might note that we applied on this particular project last year for this grant program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| and we lost to ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| The project that got the funding was Merchant Drive at Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1717)|
| 0:28:45| That's a good one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| So this is also a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| It's a worthy one to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| I hope we don't beat ourselves out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1735)|

| 0:29:33| with Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center regarding parking at White Avenue surface parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1773)|

| 0:29:40| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| Yeah, I would just like to, you know, to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| This has been a while coming, but it's going to really benefit the merchants along Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| I mean, one of the many challenges they have is parking there, and Covenant has stepped up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| and is going to allow, you know, on a limited basis, but during critical business hours, you know, parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1806)|
| 0:30:15| And that's been a challenge, and it will continue to be a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| particularly when we begin to work on Cumberland Avenue and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| So I want to thank the hard work from the law department, the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| and Covenant to finally bring this together, and it's a great partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| and it really is a statement on Covenant's part to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| to be a great partner to the business community of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| but particularly there to the ones along Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you, and I want to thank you for all the work that you put into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| to make this happen with the negotiations with the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Of course, we appreciate the hospital and our redevelopment staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| but you were key in really making this happen, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| I think it's really worthwhile, and I think it's really going to help through the development through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| and I'm really 100 percent behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| However, I would just like for the record to make sure I've had several telephone calls of people asking what strings are attached to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| and I just want to bring that out in the open to say that it's my understanding there are no strings attached with the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| but you can imagine when anything like this happens, there's always the naysayers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| So, Mayor, I just want to bring that up to make sure that we're on the record that there are no strings attached with what's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| Exactly, and Bob, you want to speak to just exactly what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| Very simply, there are no strings attached to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| Like I said, I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I just want to make sure it's on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| It's all the deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141111?start=1910)|
