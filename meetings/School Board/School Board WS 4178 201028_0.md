| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=0)|
| 0:00:31| And we're going to start with a moment of silence and Pledge of Allegiance led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=31)|
| 0:00:34| by Ms. Owen. Please stand for a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=34)|
| 0:00:40| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=40)|
| 0:01:07| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=67)|
| 0:01:16| Good evening. Thank you for joining us for the Board of Education quarterly work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| As you may have noticed, Board Chair Susan Horn is participating electronically tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| so I'll be chairing the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Just a reminder that our next work session will be held Wednesday, November 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| with the regular session to follow on Wednesday, November 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| Both meetings will be held in this boardroom starting at 5 o'clock p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| We have been notified that the representatives from Millsap-Gallon Government Relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| are unfortunately stuck in some traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| So, following the superintendent's report, we may need to take a small break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| or we might change and do teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| We're just going to evaluate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| So, be patient with us if we do take a small break. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| Now, do I have an approval of the agenda? Do I have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Okay, so moved by Mr. McMillan and seconded by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| Now we're going to have a vision mission spotlight by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| Thank you for the opportunity to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| For me, just the way I've kind of grown to learn to live life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| is to try to center mission in any space that I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| And so, I really appreciate and value the opportunity to kind of reflect a little bit on the KCS mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=154)|
| 0:02:42| So, I really want to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| So, our mission at Knox County Schools is to provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=163)|
| 0:02:51| to empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| And as I continue to dig in that and think about the specific words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| one of the things that's really stuck on me is the idea of all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| You know, and as a school board that's elected to represent specific districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| we also know that we're all elected to represent Knox County Schools as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| And so, one of the things that I've been trying to do is get around to some other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| and just see some of the challenges and some of the opportunities that are happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| This month, I've gotten to go to Spring Hill Elementary, Chilhowee Intermediate, Holston Middle, Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| and also today visited Emerald Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| And one of the things that I saw just going around to those five schools is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| one, how much our teachers are working so incredibly hard to provide accessible opportunities right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| You know, learning back in March, the door got shut on that for a period of time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| I mean, it kind of slammed shut for so many of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And one of the things that I've seen our district doing and seen our teachers doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| and our administrators doing over these last few months is really trying to get that door open again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| And so, I was really encouraged and saw some of the innovation that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| But one of the things that I really wanted to expound on was some conversations that I had over at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| So, I had not had a lot of experience at the school there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| but when I was meeting with Nathan there, the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| one of the things that he was reflecting on is that some of the students there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| when asked what AE means is they've been told from others that it means almost educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| And I thought, man, that is sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| And Nathan started spending the next two hours telling me about all the strategies that he's employing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| to change that narrative to academic excellence, to really flip the script on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| And one of the things I was really internalizing around our mission statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| is that we cannot begin to provide excellent and accessible opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| unless each individual student knows that they're worth it, that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| And to me, I take that as a personal challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| because I think it starts with all of us who care about public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| is that we have to set the tone to help our students and our parents know that we believe in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| that we believe they can excel, maybe when a lot of others have told them that they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| And so that's what I saw a lot in the teachers and the administrators as I went around to those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| is people day in, day out, in really small ways and really big ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| telling kids that, yes, you can and we believe in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| And so I'm encouraged by that, but also know that there's a heavy weight on me as a school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| to also bear that burden to help students and parents know that, yeah, we do believe in you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that that door is wide open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| and no longer shut for some students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| Thank you, Mr. Watson, for reminding us why we're all doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| And I kind of rushed through things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| On approval of the agenda, we had a motion and a second, but we also need to vote on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| So all ayes for approval of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| Any nays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| The agenda is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| So if it wasn't approved, did I have to retract my whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| You've got to go again now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| This is what happens when you have a substitute person in the chair seat tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| Now I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Thomas for the superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| First of all, before I give my report, an important announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| First, let me start by announcing that Knox County schools will be going on a two-hour delay tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| This decision was made based on the weather forecast, calling for the potential for flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| with the heaviest rainfall between 4 a.m. and 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| Buses will also be running two hours late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| I would like to clarify that this is a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Students are not expected to log on to their Chromebooks during the two-hour delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| so tomorrow is not a red day at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| It is a delay, and a two-hour delay to give our bus drivers opportunity with daylight to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| so that we can see if there's standing water, also to kind of monitor the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| during the period between 4 a.m. and 9 a.m. in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| So, again, we'll be getting that information out to parents pretty much as we are speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| Now for the superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| On Monday, we sent an important email to families with information about changing their students' learning model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| for the spring semester, which begins on January 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Families who want to change their learning model from virtual to in-person instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| or from in-person to virtual instruction must fill out an enrollment form by 3.30 p.m. on Friday, November 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| and have that turned in to us or to their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| The email sent on Monday includes a link to the enrollment form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| and we've simplified the process over what it was back in the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| so I think folks will find that it's really a simple process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| and should not have as much trouble maybe as we experienced back in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| Families who are unable to fill out the online form can get a paper copy at their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| or a printable form on our website, www.knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| And paper forms are available in six different languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| Families that have multiple children in Knox County schools should complete the form for each student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| So again, let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| If you've got multiple children in our school system, complete the form for each student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| who will change their learning model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Also, please keep in mind that families who are happy with their current learning model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| do not need to take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Again, if you're happy with the learning model and platform that you're in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| you do not need to take any action at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| As a district, we recognize that the virtual learning program has been an important option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| for families who are concerned about COVID-19 or who have specific health-related risk factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| And let me just say, and Mr. Watson alluded to it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| that our teachers are working extremely hard and administrators and our school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| It's more than just teachers and administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| And let me also say that the virtual platform with our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| they're doing an outstanding job with the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| So I don't want anything that I say to be taken like I'm not supporting the virtual learning platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| nor do I not recognize how hard folks are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| So again, I just feel like I need to provide families with all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| so that they can make the very best decision that they can possibly make for their child or their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| And over the last several weeks, we've found that the students who have the greatest success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| in the virtual program are those who benefit from a strong support structure at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| and also who are highly disciplined and self-motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| So again, the virtual program is working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| Our teachers are doing a great job, but it also takes the students on the other end doing their part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| making sure they log in, making sure they do the assignments, turn in assignments and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| A couple of few other things to consider for in-person learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| and may help make a decision that in-person learning lends itself to promoting collaborative learning for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| enhancing critical thinking skills, developing social skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| also building organizational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| Also, students maybe are a little bit more motivated by the physical presence of a teacher in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| Also, the teacher, it's a little easier for the teacher to address the different learning styles for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| Also, students are able to develop conflict resolving skills, presentation skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| and learning to work with students and teachers from different cultural backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| And again, I'm not saying that cannot happen in the virtual program because it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| but again, just for your particular situation, if you're a parent and you know your student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| how they learn best and just to make that a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Additionally, we looked at grades at the four-and-a-half-week mark of our nine-week period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| The percentage of Fs in the virtual learning program were twice that of those in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| Again, that was the four-and-a-half-week mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| We will look. The nine weeks is over, I think. It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| And report cards go out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| So I'm hopeful that when we look at it that we'll see a drastically different picture at the end of nine weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| I realize that some of this may be attributed to the fact that it's new, the virtual learning program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| and folks getting more accustomed to that style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| So I just encourage our families to keep in mind all these factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| But please, please, please know that I recognize that this is a family decision, and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| And I do want to reiterate that our teachers who teach in our virtual learning program are doing an excellent job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| and that the virtual learning program is here to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| So I don't want anything that I say to be taken the wrong way, that I am pressuring folks to do in-person learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| But I want for you and your child, we want to provide the very, very best educational opportunities that we can provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=731)|
| 0:12:19| no matter whether that's in the virtual learning program or the in-person program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| So just keep these things in mind as you make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| Also, if your child is not currently enrolled in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| and you're considering a return to Knox County schools in the spring semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| please know that we welcome your return to our in-person learning platform or virtual learning platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| So, again, if you're not currently in Knox County schools but you're thinking about coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| we want to encourage you to do so, and we will welcome you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| I also want to let our families know that we will be sending an email in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| with information about their current Chromebook insurance status and the deadline to purchase insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| However, remember that we do not make phone calls asking for insurance payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| So if you get a phone call saying that it's Knox County schools and it's about your insurance purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| just know that's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| We're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| So please don't respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| The payments should be made at your student's school or on our website, but never, never over the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| Madam Chair, members of the Board, this concludes my report for this evening, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Can I ask you one question, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Tomorrow with the delay, that's for virtual and in-person students, both the delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Yes, that would be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| So even the virtual students will have the two-hour delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I just wanted to make sure that was clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=830)|
| 0:14:01| I think we're going to go ahead and switch the order of our agenda, if that's okay with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| and start with Mr. Bolton talking about the teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| And hopefully our other guests will get here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| I know we all know with the rain and roads that probably the traffic's not great right now coming from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=851)|
| 0:14:26| I want to thank Mr. Bolton for coming and talking about teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| I know there's a lot of questions around them, and I think he's going to help try to clarify it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| and answer some questions for us concerning what's going on this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| Thank you, Ms. Vice Chair and Board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Thank you for this opportunity to kind of talk about certified evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| The purpose that I want to talk to you about is to make sure there's a little more clarity around evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| And in doing so, I kind of want to talk about where the basis for evaluation is rooted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| And I know there's probably, I'm sure you have filled some calls from maybe some teachers requesting board action to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=898)|
| 0:15:08| in terms of evaluation, so I wanted to kind of take a moment to talk about the full process of evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| Evaluations are rooted in state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| They're also rooted in the state board regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| And so in this presentation, I want to take a moment just to talk about that, walk through those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| talk about the most recent governor's recommendation that was made on October the 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| and then kind of give you an idea of the next steps in terms of certified evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| So Tennessee Code annotated, the evaluation model is a result of the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| There is state statute that sets measures in the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| It goes as far as prescribing that 50% of the overall level of effectiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| or 50% is to be weighted towards the observed model or observations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| and 50% is to be weighted towards student evaluation or from student evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| And that's written in 49.1.302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| I've got that citation on the board, and I know there's a lot of information there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| but it specifically talks about those weighted models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| So it's rooted in state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| It's also rooted in state board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| State board policy basically restates in state board policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| that particular citation in the Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| And it states that 50% of the evaluation criteria will be comprised of student achievement data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=997)|
| 0:16:46| And the other 50% is comprised of evaluation data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| So the reason why I say that is because that action that is implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| in terms of the evaluation of teachers does not take place at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| There's not much that local boards of ed can do to exempt teachers from evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| irregardless of the circumstances around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| That has to go through general assembly and through the state board of ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| And so when we talk about it, what makes a lot of teachers confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| is that on October the 16th, the governor announced that he would like to see action taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1042)|
| 0:17:32| to detach the teacher evaluations from student achievement data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| So to say that, he encouraged the general assembly to take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| to remove that 50% student achievement data component from the team evaluation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| So he simply stated that he encourages the state legislator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| because not even the governor has the power to overrule what is in state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| So therefore, he implored the general assembly to take that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| And because there's been some misinformation that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| I want all teachers to know that the governor did not make any recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| in regards to the observation component of the evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| I know that's been some discussion and that's been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| But the governor, as I read the statement, there is no mention about that observation component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| which, as is right now, makes up about 50% of the overall evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| And so, again, no action has been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| So another miscommunication, we had to send out an information today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| for folks to choose how they were going to accept their growth models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| based on student achievement evaluation because we were compelled to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| because that's current state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| So when Clint Sadler sent that out on our behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| he actually put that in the narrative to try to make that a little more understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| because it can be quite confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| So, again, observations will be as they are in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| And as of right now, there has been no action from the general assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| The general assembly will not reconvene until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| So the earliest any action that can be taken in regards to the recommendation by the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| is not until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| And, again, the governor is just recommending that the student achievement component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| of the evaluation process is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| So stay tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| That will also take action from the state board event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| just exactly like the emergency provision that went through this past spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| as a result of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| The state legislature took it up, action was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| and emergency action was taken by the state board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| So what are our next steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Like I mentioned earlier, we had to send out an email asking for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| to make selections based on student achievement data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| because that's what was provided on the October 15th release of the team evaluation calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| We've also sent out resources for in-person and virtual instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| to try to bridge the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I had supplemental materials because understanding that virtual instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| looks a little different than in-person instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| And so this information was provided, and it was provided in an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| that was sent from Mr. Thomas to all certified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| And I would encourage folks that may have not received that, check your clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| because sometimes things that go to our clutter box are things that are sent on broad email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| So just be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| We've also continued to update that information on our team evaluation resource link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| that is on our page so that teachers can have real-time access to any kind of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| that come down the pipeline when it comes to evaluation changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And then per the Tennessee Department of Ed, observations will continue as normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| because there's no action that has been taken to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| And if the governor's actions that he recommended were taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| then observations will still continue as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| It's just the 50% component will be taken out that was tied to student evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| And so we have tried to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| We realize this is going to be maybe a sore spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| maybe an area of contention with our teachers because we realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| and we recognize the trials and the struggles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| and we appreciate the hard work that they've done and they continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| But we have consistently published this message throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| that there has been no change to the evaluation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| And so we also have some additional resources that we can supplement at any time that we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| And that's basically all I've got unless you all have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| I'd be happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| I have a question, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| For teachers, and I think it's probably more in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| they're teaching both virtually and in-person classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Are there observations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Could their observations end up being just during the virtual classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| or how is that working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Because I could see some teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| obviously teachers are much more used to teaching in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| and would probably rather be evaluated on that, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| But I just didn't know how that's working, especially at the high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| It really, those measures are set up in that pre-conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| before the evaluation's beginning, setting those things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| And so I think that conversation can be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| When we talk about announced evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| there is an expectation that the principal can't announce that evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| that is occurring at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| I'll have to look into that for the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| to see how that we're handling those folks that are teaching in person and virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| But I would assume that it's handled similarly to those that are teaching fully in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| But that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| So I know we're kind of building the plane as we're flying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| But has there been any work done yet to adjust the rubric slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| for teachers that are teaching virtually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Because my guess is what is making good instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| virtual instruction is a little bit different than in classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| So as a way to help teachers actually improve and get better through that evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| has there been any thought to looking at that rubric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Yes. Here's where you get into some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| The official documents that we use have to go through the State Board of Ed for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| So our team rubric has gone through that process and it has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Now, so when we're looking at that specific team rubric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| the State Department has provided some resources to supplement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| so that it provides some additional definition of what does this actually look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| in terms of in the virtual environment, what does this particular thing look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| And so we have provided those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| So I know that's a roundabout way to say that the State Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| has not necessarily taken action to implement those guidelines into the official documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| They have provided them as a secondary resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Okay. Second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| So as a rookie board member, I'm not really up to date yet on all the evaluation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| in terms of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Might it be possible that the removal of the student achievement data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| actually happens retroactively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Would there be a chance that that data gets into the evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| but then because of legislative action that actually gets removed from the final evaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| I think typically in the sequence of when your evaluations will roll over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| in terms of the timing, typically we have an embargo on test data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| until sometime at the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| And so essentially your overall what we call level LOE for a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| which is that 50% observation, that 50% student achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| is not set in stone until sometime at the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| So that could happen, but I think that they'll likely take action pretty early on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Are there other questions for Mr. Bolton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Okay. We are still waiting for our guests to arrive in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| We've heard from them, and we're thinking in probably about another 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| So why don't we take a recess until 545?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=1561)|

| 0:52:05| Ragsdale suggested that the big four get together to lobby to change the BEP, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3125)|
| 0:52:13| was done the next year in 2007, and that did benefit Hamilton and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| And we represent, unlike TOSS and TSBA, we represent both the administration and school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| board members, so we communicate with both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| I think we'll add that in addition to TOSS and TSBA representing every issue that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| important to public education, we watch those issues, but Robert and I focus on issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| CLASS unanimously agrees are urban priorities, so that we can really target those specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| issues, because sometimes those needs are different for urban schools versus rural schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| and that's what we tend to focus on in addition to our partnership with TOSS and TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| And just a couple of examples of things that we are a lot more interested in than smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| school districts are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| One's charter schools, obviously those are all just in the big four, there aren't any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| outside of the big four urban systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| ELL is another, funding of ELL students and other ELL issues is another issue that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| for a long time been a concern of the big four districts, but now that has over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| become a bigger issue for smaller districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| 2020 brought a number of changes early in our legislative session, you know, back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3217)|
| 0:53:51| January about 15 years ago, if you guys have remembered that far back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| We had a new Speaker of the House, Speaker Sexton, who we found to be very open and interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3235)|
| 0:54:03| in supporting public schools, which was a good change for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| There was a slightly smaller House committee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| Instead of having four subcommittees, there were only three committees that rolled up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| into the full committee, which meant that every legislator had a few more bills that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| they were looking at, but made us able to better kind of focus our energy on three groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| instead of four, which was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| There were over 3,000 pieces of legislation filed and almost 600 bills that related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| K-12 education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| So when you guys get feedback from your constituents or the public about why you have a lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| it's because there are 600 bills that are related to K-12 education, and you guys have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| your responsibilities as board members and as staff members, plus most of you have other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| jobs outside of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| So Robert and I are happy that we get the opportunity to read through that and help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| you really focus your energy on the highest priority issues that come up each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| This year we anticipate another change as the long-serving Chair of Senate Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| Senator Dolores Gresham, is retiring and will be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| We think that there's some jockeying amongst Senate leadership to determine after the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| this year who will be the right person to serve as her replacement, that it depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| on how the leadership structure changes within the caucus and with leadership positions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| So there are several people that are interested in that, and we'll be watching and working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| with that new chairperson to make sure they understand all of your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| I want to talk about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| As you know, this is one of the most unusual legislative sessions that the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| has ever had because of the COVID situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| We usually have a pretty good list of new spending in K-12 on this slide, but this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| the only new spending was about $50 million that was put in the budget for BEP growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| and that is for additional students, increase in some of the BEP components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3372)|
| 0:56:21| But that's all that ended up in the final budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| There were two budgets that were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| There was a no-growth budget that was passed in March that cut a substantial amount from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| And then there was another budget that, when the legislature came back in June, the $50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3398)|
| 0:56:46| million for BEP growth was the only thing that was left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| There was originally in the no-growth budget about $51 million for teacher salaries that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| was eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| But as you can see there, when they came back in, I guess it was March, when they cut the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| In March, they cut over two dozen line items that were K-12 line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3425)|
| 0:57:14| And that, you can see the amounts there, that was $265 million that had planned to be spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| on K-12 recurring and another $120 million in non-recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| And just to finish up with the budget, this is the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| There's a state hiring and purchasing freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| And I think most significantly for us, for the next couple of years, the state budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| was balanced using non-recurring revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| And so there's going to be a lot of pushback on any proposals for new spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| And the plan is that next year's budget will also have to be balanced with non-recurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| And if not, it may be the third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| But the plan is definitely to balance the budget next year with non-recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| Departments have been asked, and this includes the Department of Education, they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| asked to cut 12% from this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| That doesn't mean those cuts are going to be made, but departments have been asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| identify those cuts in case revenue does take a turn downward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3504)|
| 0:58:34| So overall, we showed you the K-12 spending that was cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| It was about $400 million that was cut in March from the original budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| And then when it came back in June, as you can see, about $285 million was cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3523)|
| 0:58:51| So all of that's to say the budget situation is, the picture that has been painted is dire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3531)|
| 0:59:00| I will say that since, in the first two months of the fiscal year, which started for Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3540)|
| 0:59:09| in August, there's about a $400 million surplus, and that surplus is over and above what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| revenue that had been projected through the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| There is a $400 million surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| Whether that trend is going to continue, we probably won't know until January when Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| spending and that type of thing are collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| But I say that to say the picture that was painted back in the spring was pretty dire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| The revenue picture has not been as bad as what this budget is based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3580)|
| 0:59:50| And as we look at bills that passed this year that were most impactful to your school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| systems, the first bills we've chosen to highlight are some tools that were COVID-19 specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| The first authorizes the State Board of Education to create emergency rules, which allows some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| flexibility for both your teachers and for your principals to look at access to classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3609)|
| 1:00:17| so your teachers may need to work virtually or in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| You may need some teachers to have some flexibility around certification so that you can fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| some positions in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| And this gave the State Board of Education some flexibility around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| We feel like they have been as responsive as we could hope for as we look toward what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| we need to do in the transition spaces that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| So we're appreciative of their support and the work that they're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| And then Public Chapter 792 is a caption bill that was by Senator Gresham and Representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Dunn that created a commission to study what COVID-19 is doing in our community, to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| at both short and long-term changes for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| So if we need to re-evaluate funding around technology or changing the 180-day requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| or some in-person requirements or some truancy rules, this commission has the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| make some of those recommendations and look at that kind of from a 50,000-foot perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| and see what they can offer and support, which is a little different from the State Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| which is really looking at kind of every small detail and is tasked with dealing with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| kind of minute details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| This is sort of a big picture, how are we going to look at a long-term recovery strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| So we know that they will be making recommendations in January, but anticipate that there may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| be some evolution of the recommendations that they make and the work that they do, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| because of the reality of our circumstance and that COVID-19 is not winding down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| So we know this is something we're going to be dealing with long-term, so we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| more work from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| I wanted to give you an update on the Education Savings Account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| The original budget funded implementation of Education Savings Account program in Shelby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| County and Davidson County that would have cost about $38 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| That was finally eliminated in June after Chancery Court found that that was unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| Since June, that ruling in Davidson County Chancery Court was appealed to the Court of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3748)|
| 1:02:36| Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| They upheld this unanimous decision, said that that did violate the Home Rule Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| You can't pass a law that only applies to two counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| That has not been appealed as of this afternoon to the state Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| There was a statement from the governor's office when the Court of Appeals opinion came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| out that they would appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| That appeal is due by tomorrow at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3784)|

| 1:03:18| All right, this next bill is one of the things that we've spent the most time on since session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3798)|
| 1:03:35| adjourned back in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| Public Chapter 576 by Senator Gresham and Representative White was a bill that was brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| by the State Comptroller's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| In their presentation to the committees and on the floor, in response to questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| we had prompted, they said this would not impact the Big Four school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| Let me tell you what the bill does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| It requires a county legislative body to make revenue estimates and determine the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| of revenue necessary to establish a budget for the operation of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| As far as the director of school and chair of the Board of Education and Repair budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| according to those revenue estimates made by the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| A couple of days before this was to go into effect, we got a call from Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| and they said this applies to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| There's no way this does not apply to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| So we called the Comptroller's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| They said no, it only applies to, I forget the funding act that you have to adopt, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3880)|
| 1:04:52| your budgeting act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| None of our districts have adopted that state law as the way you put your budget together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| So this does apply to the Big Four school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| The response then was, well, this is just codifying current practice, because the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| commission already establishes the revenue, and that's true, but there's a question when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3915)|
| 1:05:24| this would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| And I'm not going to say much more on this, I'm going to see if there are any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| We have talked to your staff here about this, and we do have concerns for Knox County about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| some of the implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| The last conversation we've had with the Comptroller's Office was that they were going to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| with the cleanup bill to ask the legislature to do what they were trying to do, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3953)|
| 1:06:01| only making this apply to a handful of school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| That they didn't feel like we're following what this bill now lays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| I mean, I guess, could you explain for me, what are the negative implications for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| big school districts on this bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| I'll tell you generally how, I'll tell you what the Comptroller's Office told us was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3984)|
| 1:06:34| already happening, and this is not changing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| The local school board goes to the county commission and says, we want $100 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=3998)|
| 1:06:46| for schools for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| The county commission either approves that or they don't, and that's where the Comptroller's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| Office says that the county commission has established the revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4015)|
| 1:07:03| And where they say you're preparing a budget document, it's not the budget proposal that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| you are sending in April, it's the budget document that you are finally approving in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4029)|
| 1:07:17| June after you hopefully get approval from your funding body on what you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Now, what we have learned, there are some districts, Shelby County and Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| are districts who they, the funding body, essentially rely on them to tell them what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| revenue is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| And that's from property tax, from sales tax, from liquor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| So, what the Comptroller thought was happening, and that situation also happens in the smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| districts that the Comptroller is trying to address, they don't want the school boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| to be determining, even on the front end, what the revenue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| They want those county commissions that they're trying, and at Sullivan County, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| there was a threat of a lawsuit over their funding last fall, but this is in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| to something that happened in Sullivan County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| And I guess this will be instructive, exactly what did happen in Sullivan County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| The school board was assuming Sullivan County is a school district whose student population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| is going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| And so they were assuming, I think the assumption was that they were going to lose 2% of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| student population, so that would mean they were going to get 2% less in BEP based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Well, the county commission, based on reports that we got when we have been working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4128)|
| 1:08:56| the county commission said, we don't want to make that assumption of 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| We want to make the assumption of 1% so we lose less money from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| So in that case, it's not the school board saying this is how much property tax we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| going to get, this is how much sales tax is coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| It was the school board making a determination on how much state revenue they could get because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| of their assumption on student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| And so in that case, in addressing the Sullivan County situation, they would have to use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| Sullivan County assumption on student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| And my guess is that when the comptroller comes back, they may make a change where that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4177)|
| 1:09:46| it's a specific part of the assumption that the county commission makes and anyway, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| like I said, this is something that we have been working with the comptroller's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| pretty much since session adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4198)|
| 1:10:13| So public chapter 587 by Representative Johnson creates a grow your own program, which helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4213)|
| 1:10:25| specifically, this started with an issue at Austin Peay to help them partner and develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| an education kind of a teacher prep program that benefits their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| So this allows for LEAs to partner with local higher education programs to recruit, train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4237)|
| 1:10:46| and retain teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| And this is obviously a brand new program that will take some time to unroll, but opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| for communities to invest in teacher development programs are always a value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| And then public chapter 717 requires, it shortens the timeframe between when you make an offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| to a teacher and that teacher has to respond and either accept or reject that offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| This actually came from an issue in Davidson County where there were a number of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| who were kind of weighing job A versus job B and leaving that job offer sitting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| table for 30 or 60 days, which means that principal is not filling their building over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| the course of the summer like they're obligated and required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| So this just gives you a little more flexibility to say to those teacher candidates, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| don't accept this job by this date, we're going to move on to another candidate so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| you have the ability to bring those teachers in as quickly as possible when you hire new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| And then if we look at public chapter 629, it expands automatic license revocation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4306)|
| 1:11:53| there are a number of criminal actions that are actually not required for teachers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| lose their license and they are expansive, burglary, arson, statutory rape, child abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| child endangerment, child neglect, assault, a number of felony convictions that for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4325)|
| 1:12:13| strange reason are not included in automatic revocation in the state board, ask for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| ability for the courts to notify the board if a teacher is convicted of particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| a violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| The state board wants to know as soon as possible and assume some of that responsibility for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| making sure that person is not in a classroom with someone else's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4348)|
| 1:12:36| And then public chapter 734 is a vehicle by which if a school district enters into a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4356)|
| 1:12:45| that is then deemed frivolous, there is an opportunity for the third party to recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| some of those fees and this was specifically targeted toward a situation in which a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| district might sue the state for not funding that this could potentially create a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| for the state to ask for those funds back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| We know that your school districts are not going to enter into frivolous lawsuits so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| it's not something that we feel a great deal of pressure around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| And then public chapter 733, the last one on this slide from Senator Gresham and Senator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| White, is again a response to an issue that happened in Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| There are some privacy rules that don't allow, for example, you to release a video of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| that happened with a teacher to the public or if say you have a parent who is involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| in an altercation with a school bus, if someone wants to see that video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| This adds the State Board of Education to a list of authorities that have subpoena power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| to request that so you are in no way under any concern of liability if there's an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| with a teacher license and the State Board requests that video and you give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| There was a question from an attorney in Metro as to whether or not you could technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| release to them and this just says that they have subpoena power to compel that video in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| the same way a court of law does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| And so it's a protection for your districts to make sure that you're doing exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| is above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| And real quickly, public chapter 532 requires the Department of Education to develop a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4456)|
| 1:14:25| bank for formative assessments that will be made available to school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4465)|
| 1:14:35| The next bill is a clean up bill, the legislature has been grappling with alternative schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4475)|
| 1:14:44| and alternative programs for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| This does everything that you see in the first couple of sentences, but the main thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| we thought, the most important thing that it addressed, it gives the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| some discretion on zero tolerance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| There was a bill that passed last year that was being interpreted to say that if a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| had a zero tolerance offense that they could not even be assigned to an alternative school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| or an alternative program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| And they're a big concern, particularly from Shelby County, that these kids were just being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| kicked out of school, left to their own devices, and that was a worse situation than whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| zero tolerance offense that they had committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| Okay, and then the last bill that we've highlighted here by Senator Swan and Representative Farmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4539)|
| 1:15:52| has to do with truancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| There have been some back and forth discussions for years with the legislature on who is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| accountable and what authority that you have with truancy, and this is a vehicle to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| some more accountability to parents for a legal obligation to compel their kids to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| Just to clarify that, that Representative Farmer felt like it was an important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4577)|

| 1:16:45| I want to spend the last couple of minutes talking about issues that we will be watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| in the 2021 session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| Obviously, the biggest issue that we will be responding to is the COVID response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| Talk real quickly about BEP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| The BP Review Committee released their report this afternoon, and their top priority is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| holding districts harmless in regard to ADM, and there was some discussion at the BP Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| Committee yesterday before they approved the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| When that showed up as a priority back in the summer, we thought that was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| that hopefully is not going to have a lot of pushback, but there was pushback yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4653)|
| 1:17:41| in the BP Review Committee, so that's not going to be a slam dunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| The proposal specifically discussed yesterday that is going to be brought is that last year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4666)|
| 1:17:55| ADM be used to determine your BP calculation for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4675)|
| 1:18:04| There apparently are some districts that have had an increase this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| Those districts would also be held harmless if you've got an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| They're going to use the higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| So that will probably be one of the hottest topics in education, and we don't – there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4697)|
| 1:18:24| was no indication from the administration yesterday where they will fall on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| It will be up to them to provide funding if districts are held harmless or propose funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4709)|
| 1:18:39| And then we're always watching for what is included for teacher salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4719)|
| 1:18:46| As we said earlier, there was no increase for teachers in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| There's not been an indication from the administration on this either whether they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| going to include additional money for salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| We'll – are they starting – we'll start budget hearings week after next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| November 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| But the last issue under BP's definition of a teacher, there's been discussion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| a couple of bills filed for the last couple of years by Senator Gartenhauer from Hamilton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| County to define who a teacher is in regard to school funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| And his concern is that when the General Assembly approves money for teacher salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| that money is not going to people who are in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| And in the past, that's not had much traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| He's actually running his – he's up for re-election this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| This is his big issue that he is running on in Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| So we think there could be – if he's re-elected, there could be more serious push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| for defining who a teacher is in terms of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| And then there's always a threat on pre-K funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| There's not been any additional pre-K funding added to the budget since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| But there have been threats in the last five or six years to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| eliminate and move that money to K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| So we'll be watching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| MS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| HUNTINGTON.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| An ongoing discussion that we engage in as a portfolio evaluation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| We'll continue to see – even though we know that our teachers should be held harmless this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| year, we think there will be continued discussions of evaluation and data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| and we want to make sure that all of our needs are considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| We anticipate seeing another discussion of a statewide literacy initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| which was a huge push of the Department of Education in 2020 and then sort of got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| waylaid by the reality of COVID and got left on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| So we anticipate that coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| Required physical education, specifically for elementary school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| continues to be a concern and much more complicated to implement than we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| maybe ever anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| So we will continue those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| We feel like mental health services is something that will come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| at the end of the pandemic as children have been home and they have been isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| We anticipate looking – the legislature looking at ways to evaluate funding and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| support necessary for dealing with some of those mental health issues that we will be facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| A perpetual issue is A-F grading for each of your school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| The previous Speaker of the House was very focused on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| that it's not a priority for a number of other legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| So we think there may be an opportunity to reevaluate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| especially in light of changes around standards and evaluation over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| And then the last thing, we would – we usually have a meeting where we invite all school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| members and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| That's usually held during the TSBA meeting in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| They're not having their meeting in person this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| So we will – we'll be having a virtual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| We'll invite all board members and staff to – and that's where we start to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| discussion about ideas for legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| We've already gotten a few from a couple of the other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| but that's where we will start to talk about our plan and strategy for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| And we encourage you, even before we have that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| to let us know if there are things that we need to be addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| And we'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Again, appreciate you coming to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Again, appreciate you sticking around and glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4974)|
| 1:23:03| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Is there any – I know there's been some discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| waiving TNREDI testing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Is there any discussion of that even coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| There's – they're going to – the governor and commissioner have announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| they're not going to use the data for evaluations and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| But right now, their plan is to go forward with the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| We think that there's going to be a serious legislative push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| to put that off for a lot of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| Not just COVID, but we think there's going to be a push from the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| The governor's made it clear he wants the testing to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| but a lot of influential legislators are not on board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Yes, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| Just out of curiosity, I know it costs more every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| You can't take the same money that you operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| whether we're talking about this district or somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| And I think what I'm about to ask you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| applied to the local boards and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| I think they referred to it as maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| Is that still around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Yes, sir. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| You are required to spend no less than –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| the county commission is required to spend no less than what they had spent the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| Is it just no less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| It seems to me – I used to be on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| It seems to me like back then when we talked in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| that it had to be at least 10 percent above the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5096)|

| 1:26:52| schools trying to make things as normal as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| Like some elementary schools doing, you know, pajama days and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| trying to make school fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5220)|

| 1:27:07| And I think our principals and staff and teachers have just gone above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| I've seen a lot of the schools still trying to do their homecoming themes and that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| And it's really very encouraging, really trying to keep the spirit of school alive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| in these kind of crazy times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5242)|

| 1:27:45| virtual and in person, there's nothing that, you pretty well covered it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| and I agree with what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5272)|

| 1:28:03| Another advantage of in person is, particularly in the middle to upper grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5283)|
| 1:28:13| it brings about a competitive nature that you just don't get from the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5293)|
| 1:28:23| Yes, sir, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| I did not mention that, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| I'm, you know, like you said, we'll deal with any situation that the family wants to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5308)|
| 1:28:37| But I would strongly encourage them to give serious consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| to in person learning for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201028?start=5323)|
