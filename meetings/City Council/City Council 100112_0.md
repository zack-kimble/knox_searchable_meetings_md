| 0:00:12| us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| If we could stand and bow our heads in accord with the greater presence that unites us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=16)|
| 0:00:23| renew our spirits and our minds, and draw us into that place of peace and wisdom so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=23)|
| 0:00:29| that our work here tonight at this meeting, listening and acting with patience and humility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=29)|
| 0:00:33| toward each other, will not be a burden but a delight in kind service to the well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=38)|

| 0:01:17| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Is there a motion to approve our meeting of December 29th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| I'll take both that for a move and that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| Any corrections, additions, deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Any items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| I'd like to move to postpone Item 12B for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| This is the EMC ordinance to reduce the street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=108)|
| 0:01:56| There's some discussion now with the administration about having a task force to look at how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| use technology to reduce signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| We don't know at this point if it's going to happen, but it makes sense if it is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| to happen to fit this part into the discussion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| So I'd like to postpone that until we know that's happening, and if it is, to give it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| a little chance to get going and maybe come with some more holistic solutions to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| I'd like to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| There's a motion and a second to postpone for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| 12B is postponed for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Anything else to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| On 12C, and this is the Greenway plan, I wanted to suggest that we do a workshop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| It seems like a wonderful opportunity for the new council members to learn about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| Parks and Rec is doing, how it operates, as well as what the future is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| I was going to make a postponement that this is actually an ordinance, so it's a two-reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| item, and I don't know if folks want to postpone that for after the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| This has been in gestation for at least three years now, so I don't think two to four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| difference is going to make a lot of impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| But we don't necessarily have to postpone to have a workshop, so I wanted to share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| and see what the will of council was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Mr. DelGolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| Mr. Mayor, this is something that I'm somewhat familiar with, having served on the Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| Commission, and there have been a number of public meetings, lots of input from various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| boards and bodies and citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| I will agree that several weeks doesn't matter, but we could actually have a workshop between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| the first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| It is sort of a roadmap for people to be looking at as they do other work in our city as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=223)|
| 0:03:51| where parks or greenways might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| It's certainly a healthy thing to have as a guidepost, so I guess I would rather not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| see it postponed for that reason, but a workshop is a wonderful idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| Right now, there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| We're going to move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Any other items dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| We do not have any consent items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| We will move on to mayor's report, and actually, I'm going to do council report first tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| and then come back to mayor's report, so we'll take reports from members of council first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| I'd like to thank the Public Service Commission for the terrific job they did during our excitement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| with the snow and the ice and the cars on the side of the road and all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| They just really did a super job in getting side roads cleared out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| I just really want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| We'll come back with some more on that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Mr. Della Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| There was an exchange earlier in the week about the KUB process that's ongoing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| and they've been doing a lot of work to pull together both the policy review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| as well as responding to the resolution of this body that was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| And we have with us Mintha Roach and Bill Elmore, and they've been good enough to come down to speak to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| and I'd like to have an opportunity for them to speak during this meeting whenever that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| I think this would be the right time if you'd like to call on them during your council report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I guess we should do it then if this is the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Are you ready to come up and talk to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| And I will say as background, as Ms. Roach is coming up to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| that there was a question about whether the appeal body that we had talked about in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| I guess actually the former council has spoken about in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| was something that needs to be in place before the completion of the six-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| or so review policy review committee that's going on and looking at vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| and how they clear and their practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| And the question comes up, since there will be ongoing clearing and activity that will affect individual homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| whether if we run into someone who's got a conflict, whether there's a place they can appeal to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| and I guess the question was posed, isn't this something that should go forward at the present time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| so citizens will have a place to turn to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| And I think Ms. Roach is prepared to speak to that and what they're doing at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| And we thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| I'm glad to be here, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| As many of you know, I worked here for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| If you could give us your name and title and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| I'm in the road 722 Chiawood Circle, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| I worked here for 17 years, so it's a great opportunity for me to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| and see some folks I haven't seen for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| So I'm glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| In particular, when I was invited by Councilman De La Volta to be here, in his email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| which I believe each of you received a copy of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| If you didn't, I have copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| But in his email, he is replying to an email that I responded to, to Ambassador Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| And if you don't mind, I'm going to read it because I think that's to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| He asked me to come and clarify my comments in my email to Ambassador Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| And in Councilman De La Volta's email, he said, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| You, meaning me, say Council agreed to defer consideration of the Appeals Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| until after the Policy Review Panel acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| And then he asked when Council did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Was it in or out of meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| And so I'm really glad to be here and clarify this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| because I certainly don't want anyone on Council to think I put words in your mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| because that's not what I intended and it's not what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| So let me read again and quote from my letter, my email back to Ambassador Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| Quote, We did suggest and Council agreed that a review panel was a good idea, comma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| And in our view, it should precede the establishment of an Appeals Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| so that such a board can have the benefit of the review panel's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| Our position was that we will look at everything there is to look at through this review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| but we really think it's important for the policy of Tree Trim to be considered first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| and then to consider what the review panel would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| I don't want any of you to think we don't care about what our ratepayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| your constituents, think about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| It's an important issue to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| It's an important issue to your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| It's an important issue to our ratepayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| We have, over the last four to five years, made a lot of changes to our vegetation management program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| changes which I think improved the program and, very frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| changes that came to us through Council members and citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| As an example, just probably three or four weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| Councilman Roddy suggested to me that the door hanger needed to reference the mature tree policy trim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| where people could ask for an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| It was not on the door hanger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| It was an excellent suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| We've already made that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| It's on the door hanger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Over the last four or five years, we've worked closely with many of you, including Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| She represented the residents of West Hills very well with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| It's been a very tough issue, but I can't name the times I have met with her directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| She's made many, many suggestions for improving communication process, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| and we're indebted to her for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| She was the person who actually suggested we put our notices about tree trim to our customers in a green envelope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| so they wouldn't be in the blue envelope, they wouldn't think it's a bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| they wouldn't see it in a white envelope, they wouldn't throw it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Those are the kind of suggestions we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| We have many, many, many, many other suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| So what I say to you is there is no reason for us not to support totally the process to review this entire tree trim program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=601)|
| 0:10:11| how people can appeal if they aren't happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| We embrace that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| We want the input, and we want it to meet our customers' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| But I want to also emphasize to you that we have operational obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| There are issues where trees coming into conflict with a power line conduct electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| That is a safety problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| That's a reliability problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| So we want to work hard in achieving what we need to for operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| but also be sensitive to our customers' issues associated with trimming trees that are within their property area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=640)|
| 0:10:51| Many of you have come to see me about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Many of you have called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| I have a meeting tomorrow with Councilman Della Volpe on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| So I hope we'll have an opportunity to discuss it even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Those of you who haven't called me or come to see me, I want to encourage you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| I'm a public servant, just like everybody who works for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| So I'm here at our ratepayer and your behest, and I encourage you to come to me with any issues you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| So I hope, Councilman, that that clarifies the intent of what I wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| I certainly wasn't intending to say that council had approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| What I said was, in our view, the issue of appeals should be included in the review panel's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| All right, and I appreciate that, and I guess the question maybe you can clarify for us is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| what does a person do at this point if they discuss with the appropriate representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| but cannot come to an agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| You have to go on, and then you have crews, and you have to cut a certain circuit or area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| How do they get that resolved in the interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| We have no procedure at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Actually, the same way it's been resolved all along, the same way it was resolved at your home when you had issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| we had issues with you and your trees, it's initially addressed by a letter going to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| and or a door hanger that says, if you have questions, call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| The call initiates the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| There's a database that we have started keeping that basically says what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| We have an arborist who goes out and visits with the person in the field, looks at the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| plans what needs to be done, tells the homeowner what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| If the homeowner isn't satisfied with that, then that arborist goes back, puts it in a database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| and immediately uploads the next morning to the lead arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| That's Liz Hannah, Liz DDA Hannah, which I think many of you have had the opportunity to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| She reviews that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| She gets engaged as needed, but she reviews and supervises all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| She will actually meet in the field very often with a third-party consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| if it's necessary to talk about tree trimming, the health of the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| and how we do it in order to maintain the health of the tree and what compromises can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| If it is a hardwood that is healthy and it's an old-growth tree, what options can we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| If it's a magnolia that grows slower than some others, what options do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| So she tries to work one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| I'm assuming 99 times out of 100 that's going to work, but what happens to that other person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| I will get to that if you let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| If that isn't successful, there are supervisors above her that it goes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| and this is all within our structure within KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| and ultimately it comes to Bill Elmore, who's our COO, and then it comes to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| and then it goes to our KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| Our KUB board is a citizen board just like you all, but they're not elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| but they're there to represent our community, and I will be very frank with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| It's never gotten that far because we have been able to come to resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| either by means like we did with you with a signed agreement that we go ahead and proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| You might not have been happy with it, but we got to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| I can't think of a single one that has been a total standoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| So it may take us months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| It may take us a lot of effort, but our goal is to reach a consensus with the homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| with the customer, and meet our operational needs at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| I wanted to thank you for coming here because I guess my perception of what had happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| at the council meeting was different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Of course, Mr. Frost was sitting in this seat when he proposed that resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| but it started as an appeal board resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| and then was expanded to include the overall policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Bill Elmore, I believe, represented KUB that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| and I believe in the discussion at that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Bill Elmore said that the way we envision it, we'll have a review panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| and that review panel's work would include the issue of addressing the council's issue on appeal rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| So that is definitely a part of the review panel's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Yes, different subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| I'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Let me just see if there's anything else on this topic before we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Thank you very much for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you for inviting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Vice Mayor Becker, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Just for everybody's reading pleasure, the city audit is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Always exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I know copies are going fast, so get yours now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Also wanted to go, it's coming up on Martin Luther King celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| I know everybody here has got a card that includes a lot of the events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| luncheon on Thursday and the big parade celebration coming up on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| I wanted to say one of the things that didn't get in this that folks are invited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| United Campus workers are having a dinner Monday at the Unite building at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| Folks are welcome to come to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Let me go to the Mayor's report real quick, and the first item the Vice Mayor's took, but I'll just back that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| Martin Luther King celebration week starts tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| There's interfaith prayer service at noon at Mount Calvary Baptist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| and on Thursday the 14th there's a leadership awards luncheon, which is the Marriott at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| And the parade that Bob spoke about is Monday the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Steps off at 10 a.m. from the Phyllis Wheatley Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| The former Mayor Victor Ashe is the Grand Marshal for the annual parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| So encourage everyone to be a part and celebrate those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Secondly, the Nissan LEAF, it's the new Nissan electric car, is on a 22-city tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| I got a chance to see it when it was unveiled in Nashville a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| And they're coming to Knoxville this Friday, January 15th, at World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| There will be a press event from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., and the car will be on public display from 9 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| So that's this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Nissan's unveiling their, I guess, their Knoxville unveiling is this Friday, the 15th, at World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| Third, speaking of the Martin Luther King celebration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| if you'd like to be a part of physically doing something to help celebrate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| the City of Knoxville and Keep Knoxville Beautiful invites you to help do that by revitalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| or being a part of revitalizing the historic Alex Haley Heritage Square in Morningside Park this Saturday, January 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| Everyone's welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Check in at the statue any time between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. to volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| You can come for the whole time, or you can come if you just have an hour to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| We'll take that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| So, again, it's at the Alex Haley statue up on Morningside Park, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| And finally, thank you, Ms. Palmer, for thanking our public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| They did have a very, very busy couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| They basically started working Thursday about 2, finished up that night about 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| and took a break from 10 to 2 a.m. on Friday and then came back to work and have been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| I have in here somewhere the total amount of tons of salt that they spread, which is actually fairly phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| But one thing that everybody should know, there's a lot of questions around any time we have a major snow event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| of how do they decide what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Well, they have a policy of priority one roads, priority two roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| priority one are all the main highways, priority two are the connector roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| We don't get to every neighborhood street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| So you might have had some people in your district say, hey, how come they never salted my street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| Our policy to date, quite frankly, is not to do every neighborhood street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| and there's a reason, which I'll come to in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| But we get to as many as we can, and as roads get cleared, we spread salt over more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| One of the reasons we don't is it probably also would be beneficial for the Council to know in that, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| three-day period, the total cost, we spent about $125,000 on snow removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| And most of that's in the cost of the salt and the chemicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| It's about $100, $105,000 of that, and the rest of that's in overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| So it is a fairly expensive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Typically, in the past, we don't have long periods like this in Knoxville where it stays below freezing for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| So the roads tend to clear up on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| This time, we obviously have been living with that longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| It's like everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| You can fix a lot of problems if you want to spend a whole lot more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| But if we make a decision as soon as it snows to salt every road in the city, we're going to be increasing that number exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| So that's a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| If you have questions, I'll be glad to try to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Or David Brace, who runs our Public Service Department, has obviously been very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| very involved in all this for the last five days and can answer more specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| CAT routes, what's the priority there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| I actually spoke with Cindy this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| Sam, you might remember exactly, but they have a snow routes and then a, I guess, what do they call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| Like super snow routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| There's two different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| There's one when it's bad like it was this time where they're only doing their main roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| And I don't remember exactly how they break that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| And then they have another where they do two-thirds of their route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| And I can get Cindy to get all that information to you all if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| I think that's it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| We actually, let me just, bottom line, we spread 1,250 tons of salt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| and 4,100 gallons of calcium in that three-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| So it's a little bit of what the city was up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1224)|

| 0:20:35| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Yeah, quick update related to CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Council also has an appointment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| We couldn't make a decision on that quick enough to get to tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| But Mr. Pavlis has agreed to explore filling that role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| and hopefully we'll have a resolution appointing him here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| I want to thank him for being willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1256)|

| 0:22:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| I just think that if we have someone here from the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| if they could give us just a nickel's worth because I'm sure the citizens are wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| why we're spending roughly a half a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| and I know we want the best police force that we can get, but I think we ought to hear a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| I think it's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Chief Roush, I'll let you take over from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| That's not working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1360)|

| 0:22:52| Lieutenant Stiles, he can come up and give just a brief of how we've gotten to where we are with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| Jeff, if you'd do that, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| Mayor and Council, my name is Lieutenant Jeff Stiles of the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| I'm the training director, 800 Howard Baker Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you for letting me be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| I've just got a few remarks, and then I'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| In 2009, the Knoxville Police Department confiscated over 2,400 firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| These firearms were taken off of suspects on the street, in traffic stops, in houses, and in apartments around our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| Of the over 50 search warrants that the Knoxville Police Department executed in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| 70 to 80 percent of those search warrants resulted in our officers recovering firearms in the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| Nationwide, of the 47 officers killed in the line of duty in 2009, 23 of those killings occurred in buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1416)|
| 0:23:45| The Knoxville Police Department prides itself on professionalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| and our ability to keep our citizens safe by preventing crime and responding to calls for assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| In order to do that, we continually attempt to bring our officers the best training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and the best equipment possible to accomplish that mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| About two years ago, the Knoxville Police Department training unit began researching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| how we could continue to improve the quality of training that our officers receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| We looked at how officers were assaulted and killed nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| and in what situations they were in at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| and how officers were being trained to prevent the same thing from happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| We have a great training program that's helped keep our officers and citizens safe here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| but the one thing we've never had is the ability to put an officer in a live fire situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| in a building that would simulate a house, an apartment, a building, or a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| using the officer's issued weapon and live ammunition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| We've been fortunate that we've had a video-based use of force simulator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| We train our officers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| The simulator is great for teaching decision-making skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| and putting officers in various teaching scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| However, it is limited in that it is video-based and cannot bring the realism of moving through a structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| learning tactical angles, looking for hiding places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| and engaging real targets with real guns and real ammunition in a safe environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| The 360-degree shoot house we want to construct will allow us to do all those things and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| We'll be able to more effectively respond to violent situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| such as school, church, or business shooting events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| We'll be able to simulate low-light environments where most police-involved shootings occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| We'll be able to configure rooms and furnishings that will make the scenarios more realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| and allow officers to deploy their firearms in realistic settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| Our officers in the Knoxville Police Department go through extensive training on the use of firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| Our academy requires two times the state-mandated level of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| and our passing or successful score is higher than that as mandated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| While firing in a range at fixed or moving targets on a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| is great training for marksmanship and manipulation of firearms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| it cannot simulate the sounds, smells, stress of firing inside of a structure in an unknown environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| Effective law enforcement depends on developing strong relationships with partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| our partners on the street and our partners within the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| This facility will benefit not just the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| but other local, state, and federal agencies we work with to protect our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| By having a facility of this nature, the Knoxville Police Department will be able to host training sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| that we have not had the ability to host in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| Therefore, we can save time and save money from sending officers away from home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| and from their regular duties and can also increase our partnerships that provide safer communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| This 360-degree shooting facility, with all the benefits we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| creates real training value for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| All these things together will increase our officers' abilities to protect themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| and protect the citizens that we've sworn to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| No. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| You said that other law enforcement agencies would utilize that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| Is that something that we just provide for them, or is it something that is a lease-type situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| We currently have a lot of other agencies that utilize our facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| just because we have, frankly, one of the premier facilities in this part of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| We've got officers from other county agencies, city agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| that attend training at both our Moses Center Police Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| and also at our firearms and driving facility out on Cement Plant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| So we have, for a long time, been a clearinghouse of police training, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| I'm proud to say that the folks that are on our training staff are some of the best in the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| and have testified as subject matter experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| So developing those relationships has been a long practice that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| I was going to say, as a footnote to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| there are some other agencies that use it and do pay money to the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| which will help reduce our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| We have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| We have on some occasions with other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| I know that some agencies from different parts of the state have come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| and wanted to use driving facilities and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| And we charge a small maintenance fee for those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| and for staffing, having to staff the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| So, yes, the cost saving is incurred there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1690)|

| 0:28:44| dated December 2009, which amends the general plan and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1724)|

| 0:28:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Again, I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| I mentioned this at dinner tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I asked Cindy to poll folks about doing a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| And I think our next workshop date would be January 21st on our traditional Thursday beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1740)|
| 0:29:09| and maybe see if that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| And that is before second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| So that would work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Mr. Mayor, I might add for members of the public that are interested, this should be on, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| the MPC website and, if not, certainly on Parks and Rec website so that they can look at this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| But it is certainly our first here in Knoxville that has this kind of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| and mappings of where facilities might be, greenway trails, parks, and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| And it talks about our needs and our approaches to solve these problems going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| So it's an important document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| And citizens should take advantage of the electronic age and take a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1790)|

| 0:30:29| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Mr. Mayor, I'd like to just say the Public Property Naming Committee reviewed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| and we approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| And Mr. Lafleur was an educator and a community leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| and I think this is a great honor to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| Mrs. Lafleur, his wife, was an applicant, and I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| And I'd like to encourage you at some point to have a ceremony over there to honor the street change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| Great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1854)|

| 0:30:57| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1858)|

| 0:31:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Mr. Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Just a brief clarification from Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| I might understand this is the one, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| a partial acre parcel, like three-tenths of an acre we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| not a whole district or area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| It's for this single parcel only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Is there some use that C3 allows that would cause concern compared to an industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| I guess C3 has a higher zone than the industrial one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| I think many people would consider the industrial zone to be more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| and a broader range of intense activity than the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| C3 typically allows retail, restaurants, hotels, motels, offices, and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| whereas an industrial you can do manufacturing and heavier commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I wanted to ask Mr. Donaldson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| As I look at agendas, I tend to think where there's some learning opportunities from the new council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| I think Mr. Pavlis serving on MPC doesn't need this, but this is an interesting one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| because we have a situation here where we're moving a piece of property that used to be an engineering office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| and making it a law office, and the zoning is actually from an industrial to a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| And I wanted Mr. Donaldson just to take two or three minutes and kind of explain why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| because there's a little counterintuitiveness to that that might be good for folks to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| So, Mr. Donaldson, do you want to explain that for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Is the counterintuitiveness that going from an engineer to a lawyer is an upgrade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| Was that the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Yes, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| He was going to say that was a downgrade, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| There's always some interesting information on each application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| and one piece of this is that the property has been vacant for a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| and as a result of that vacancy, it lost a legal nonconforming use as an office in an industrial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=1996)|
| 0:33:24| So when somebody came back to reclaim and reuse this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| they had to get the zoning corrected in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| So essentially going from an office to an office in this case because of the vacancy required a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| That industrial zoning may have been a part of a broad sweeping rezoning that was done several decades ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2019)|
| 0:33:48| I suspect under the heading of economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| where literally every railroad corridor in the county was rezoned to industrial on 500 feet on each side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2032)|
| 0:34:06| and over time we have been gradually reclaiming that as property owners discover that perhaps their best use is not industrial and something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2046)|
| 0:34:17| So you will periodically see rezonings from industrial that happen to be within that railroad corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| to other uses that are consistent with the sector plans that we've drawn up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| but because of that past practice of rezoning generally along railroad lines still had an industrial zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2070)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100112?start=2080)|
