| 0:05:08| February 20th 0-9. Sunrise Market and Deli 8802 Tazewell Pike. I actually sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:17| them through a drive-through and they purchased a six-pack of beer. Was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:25| license tendered to the clerk at the drive-through? Does your record reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=325)|

| 0:05:44| Deli 8802 Tazewell Pike. You heard the testimony of the officer sir? Yes sir. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=344)|

| 0:05:58| have a question. Yes sir. You continue to use the drive-through window now? Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| I'm just going to I have an opinion about the drive-through windows and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| alcohol sales and if the offense occurs again I'm going to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| re-advocation for your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Mr. Lambert. I just don't want to ditto what Mr. Anders said. I know I was young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| once and when I was underage that's where most of my friends would purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| alcohol. They would do it through a place that had a drive-through. Drive-throughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| tend to be a magnet for young people and you need to be very very careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| with drive-throughs and I will be backing him up if you're if you're ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| caught again I will move for revocation and I think that you should strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| consider asking folks to come in to purchase alcohol. I've been there 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| years and I don't sell beer to kids. The lady made a mistake. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| Is she still working for you? No sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| Commissioner Hammond. Question for the law director with regards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| drive-throughs. Are there any regulations with regards to that or is it the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| as if you walk inside? No Commissioner, Mr. Chairman, members of the board no there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| no distinction made in statute or in our ordinances either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| Make a motion to follow our rules either a 30-day suspension or a $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| fine for the first offense. Second. Property moved and second all in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| say aye. Aye. Opposed? The ayes have it. Sir what would be your preference a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| suspension or a fine? Fine. To your left is the old courthouse within seven days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| you'll have to pay that. The next item is 5C town and country number 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| 8418 Rutledge Pike. Calvin Green is the owner. This is the first offense. Here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| again on 2209. Sit undercover officer in town and country number 3 8418| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=489)|
| 0:08:18| Rutledge Pike and purchase a six-pack of Bud Light. Is there a representative here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:28| from town and country? State your name for the record please and business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| address. Calvin Green 8418 Rutledge Pike Knoxville, Tennessee 37924. Do you hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| the testimony of the officer? Do you admit or deny the defense? Admit. Defer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| the board. He's admitted. Yes sir. Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| Yeah Mr. McKenzie. A question for the officer if you don't mind stepping back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| up. It seems like there's a pattern here on the same day and basically the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| area looks like this was kind of one outing that that netted these three. How| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| many other in a typical day is this is this typical to have three offenses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| one day? Yes when we do the undercover stings we'll hit somewhere between 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| and 20 different places and we're kind of on a roll here for the last three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| stings we've done. We've gotten three sales on each one of them. Yeah you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| I mean that that to me is disturbing. I guess I'm speaking to the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| owners out there. I mean even if it was 20 to have three underage sales out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| 20 is is very disappointing and I would hope that that that these are first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| offenses and that that that that we won't see any of you all again in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| light because I'm being a father of a 20 year old it does trouble me greatly that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=599)|
| 0:10:07| that we're you know aiding and abetting in this process by by not checking this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| blatant ID that says I'm a 21 that's turned in different directions so I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| you know ask you all to please check the IDs and and please do not sell to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| underage individuals. Thank you. Commissioner Schaff. Thank you chairman. I was just asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| officer May was did this clerk ask for an ID? I don't recall if an ID was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=631)|
| 0:10:41| on this one. Okay because it is a state law isn't it that they are required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| under the age of 50 I believe is the law now. Okay and as in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| situation they asked for it and then it said the guy was under 21 they sold it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| in the second one I think you said they didn't even ask for it. Correct. Okay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| this one you do not you're not you're uncertain. I am. Okay. Commissioner Brown. Yes I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| have a question for Mr. Green. How long had this employee been with you? She was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| from Ohio and she worked at my deli for about four months and then she'd been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| my restaurant for about two months. Is she still employed? No sir. I was let her go the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| that it happened. You know I kind of agree on some of these things we're getting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| lot of sting a lot of results from the sting and I appreciate and applaud the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=692)|
| 0:11:41| Sheriff's Department for doing the job that they do on it. One thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| disturbs me and maybe we need to take a look at this is that in one case here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| they didn't even ask for an ID. Maybe that should be a higher penalty. It is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| state law. I have the video tape of it. She did ask for an ID. Well I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| talking about you in this case but the second one here did not they were weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| even asked for an ID. So you know I think maybe we need to make a distinction in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| that case when we talk about some of these penalties. Do you have something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| Commissioner Shouse? I just make make a motion for the thousand dollar or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| five hundred dollar fine or 30-day suspension. Properly moved and second for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| 30-day suspension of a $500 fine. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=748)|
| 0:12:36| What would be your choice sir? I'll take the $500 fine. Old courthouse clerk's office within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| seven days. Thank you. Commissioner Lutho. Thank You Mr. Chairman. You know since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| we're having a lot of seems like we're you know they're catching a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| these businesses selling the underage. You know maybe with the media here maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| Commissioner Hammond you know maybe we could get the word out that the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| department is out there with these things and and maybe if there was a news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| article or a TV series going on that news reports maybe maybe get word out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| these businesses they better get their employees and and make sure that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| following the law and and not selling to these underage because they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| get caught and maybe that will help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| Okay clerk. Mr. Chairman I have a quick question for the law director. According to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| rules now that we have passed on beer can we not levy a fine up to $2,500? In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| the ordinance that is proposed yes sir. But we haven't passed it yet. No sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| that'll be coming up before the board today for your first reading. By now I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| don't think it's up to a thousand for the first time is that right Joe? No I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| mean up to the first time offense you have either 30 days or $500 under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| new proposal you'd have the ability if you find it egregious enough to seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=842)|

| 0:26:12| a motion we defer this for 30 days. Is that going to give enough time? I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| defer. Get it to VZA. Grant do you know when he could apply and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| long it would take for it even be heard? I guess it'd be at least 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=1583)|

| 0:26:48| after that. Actually it looks like Wednesday. It's like VZA is the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| Wednesday so it would be in fact a few days before the the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=1611)|

| 0:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| I realize that mostly this has to do with safety improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| and that this is at the end of a long series of stadium upgrades and improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| I just worry that it sends the wrong signal that we are attending to football stadium upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| at a time we are laying off teachers and spending $854,000 to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2463)|

| 0:41:30| and I think we are actually saving money by doing the upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| because if someone were to get hurt because of worn out equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| I think that we are probably, it is a stitch in time that is going to save nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| because I think we are saving ourselves lawsuits in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=2505)|

| 1:01:10| Our 19 commissioners have voted for Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| Congratulations, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:33| Third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Well, me and Tony ain't going to let you get away that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| We've had three good qualified candidates, and I want to nominate Miss Jean Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| Miss Teague is retired and got a lot of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| She served 28 years on the city council, also serves on the Metropolitan Planning Commission for two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| a member of West Hills Community Association, and also a member of the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| And it's my pleasure to nominate Miss Jean Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Indeed, we had several people that were qualified, I think, to serve on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| I'd like to nominate Miss Polly Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| Miss Doka has served, as I think you've gotten some paperwork on her, Mayor's Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:32| she's the president of the Council of Office of Involved Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| She's been an officer in the Lone Strive Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| She's a member of the leadership class of Knoxville 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| Miss Doka has been involved in several development issues, land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| and our communities on our part of town for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| And I think she'd present a very balanced view of zoning issues for Knox County representatives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| So, again, I recommend Miss Polly Doka. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| I don't want to nominate anyone, but I was wondering if we could have both of the candidates speak shortly, if they're both here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Motion to close nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Properly moved to close nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Either one of you can go first, Gene Teague or Miss Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:47| I need your address, name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| Gene Teague, 917 Carrington Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| That's in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| I think that I have presented each one of you this morning with a resume that I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| I think, as Ivan had said, I've been involved in the community for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| I served on the city council for 28 years, and I was actually the first homeowner advocate in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:17| I believe in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| I believe in good, orderly, planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| And I think if you'll go back, you will see my track record regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| I've also served on Metropolitan Planning Commission on two different occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| And the first time I served on MPC, we also acted as the Board of Zoning Appeal Inverences, so I've had some experience there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:42| Presently, I am the chairman of the Zoning Commission in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| I've been involved in so many, a lot of activities before, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| Having been in the community for all these years, you get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| If you get involved in one thing, you know people will ask you for other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| But I hope that you will give me consideration for this because I think I am well qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| I did orthopedic nursing, and I also did psychiatric nursing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| So I think that qualifies me real well for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| So I hope that you will take me under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| Hello, I'm Polly Doka, 4804 Tomachi Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| First of all, let me say that the 3rd District is really lucky to have two good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| I'm the past president of the Council of Involved Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| I am here to promote quality development, and I realize that sometimes there's slight variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| or variances that need to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| I'm going to attend the vacant property conference in Louisville, Kentucky in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| and I think vacant property is something that we're going to have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| whether it's abandoned and vacant property or foreclosure property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3954)|
| 1:06:02| Again, I'm in the process of bringing a condemned house up to codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| and that has been a very interesting learning experience, if anyone's ever done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| I've served on Mayor Haslam's Neighborhood Advisory Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| and have done that for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| And again, I'm just here to try to make Knoxville a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| This is not anything that's promoting my job or myself as a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| I, like most of you, are just interested in making Knoxville a better place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Thank you. Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| Do you have something else, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| I just want to commend the 3rd District for nominating two incredibly qualified women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| I'll start that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| I served several years with Ms. Teague on MPC, and she always did her homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| So I don't know the other lady, but I'm going to support Ms. Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| I'd just like to say this really does look like there's two excellent candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| and I hope that whoever doesn't get it stays involved because we really need citizens like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| But I'll vote for Jean Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| I'd like to concur with what Commissioner Briggs has said, but I'm going to vote for Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Jean Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Pali Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| Commissioner Avan Harman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Commissioner Burrells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Pali Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Pali Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| I'd also like to concur with the other commissioners in that we had two excellent candidates from the 3rd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| but I'd like to vote for Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Does the past wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| Teague?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| 14-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| 14-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| 14 Teague, 5 Doka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Congratulations, Ms. Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:59| Second District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| Mr. Chairman, we had a wonderful community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| I want to thank Commissioner Wright for being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| Four persons expressed an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| All were qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Two stood out as very qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| And so I would like to quite simply add another incredibly qualified woman to that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| Her name is Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Renee has incredible experience in planning issues, land and water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| She's actually worked on these on a statewide level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| She has worked for Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| She has an incredible record in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| Now, both of our two good candidates at some point may have to recuse themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| One, the other one is an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| This one may occasionally have some clean water issue pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| But neither should be thought of badly in that regard because they bring incredible experience to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| a slightly different set of experience from each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| But I believe that Renee Hoyos, and I served on BCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| is the kind of person to take forward some of the concerns of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| some of the concerns about runoff, some of the concerns about putting aside some land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| and making sure that property rights end where the next person in the neighbor begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| and that we act responsibly and reasonably in regard to our precious resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| Both are good candidates of the two that we called in back as finalists in a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| But of those two, I would side with and nominate Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:45| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| I would like to nominate Marcus Chatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| And as Mark said, we had a very hard time choosing between these two nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| They're both excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| The reason that I was more favorable towards Marcus is that he also has tremendous experience with land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:12| with conservation issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| As the former president of the Great Smoky Mountain chapter of Trout Unlimited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| he's done a lot of lobbying for conservation measures and performing habitat restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| He's familiar with runoff issues and with stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| But he also has experience, which I think is very important, working with his neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| and has seen firsthand the damage that can be done as a result of weak stormwater ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| and irresponsible development upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| We've had a real problem in the Fairmont Emeryland neighborhood with flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| that the city is in the process of fixing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| I attended those neighborhood meetings and saw firsthand how valuable Marcus's input was into that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4313)|
| 1:12:03| and how he was able to bring some issues up that other people had not thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| He's an architect, and he is very familiar with what BZA does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:15| He's also bound by a professional code of ethics as an architect, and I find that very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| He's also a member of Knox Heritage, so he's very familiar with historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| Although I very much like Rene and would be happy with Rene on BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:39| I have to feel that Marcus has a greater breadth and depth of relevant experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:48| So that is why I have chosen to nominate Marcus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| I move nomination cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| The motion has been made for nomination to cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| We're going to hear from the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| Yes, we're going to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| Do you have something, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| I'd just like to hear these people speak, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Oh, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Rene, would you like to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| Marcus, you can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to speak with you briefly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| My name is Marcus Chady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| I'm seeking appointment to the District Chief Seat of the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| I believe my qualifications demonstrate not only that I can fulfill the requirements of a BZA member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| but to be an asset to the board as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| My prior experience in construction and business ownership, along with my current practice as an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| equip me with knowledge that's most relevant and critical to BZA proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| A BZA member must determine the magnitude and impacts of a variance request relative to the hardship expressed by an appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:09| I strongly believe that relevant experience is paramount in making these determinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| A duty exists to approach these requests with objectivity, weighing the implications of a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| and ensuring that the spirit of the zoning ordinance is therefore upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| I feel like I'm most qualified to fulfill these obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| I ask for your support in my appointment and very much appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Ms. Hayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| Renee? Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| I do not see Renee Hoyos here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| What's her last name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| H-O-Y-O-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| I'd also like to add that Marcus has a very cool ponytail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:57| I noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Okay, are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Again, second district has done an outstanding job, but I'm going to give the nod to Ms. Hoyos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| in that my previous public service prior to coming on commission, active with Knoxville Utilities Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:22| and her working with the board on some difficult issues that greatly affected the rate payers of the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| Knox County area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| She held herself in high esteem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| She's very professional and worked her way through this difficult process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| So, Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:52| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| Chatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4556)|

| 1:16:40| Chatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| Chatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| Seventeen votes for Chatty, two votes for Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| Mr. Chatty, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| First district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4615)|
| 1:17:04| I guess let me first apologize for my nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| He asked me did he need to be here today, and he had another engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| I told him no, so that's the only reason that he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| He was willing to break his other engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| But I'd like to nominate Daniel Brown for the first district board of zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| Dan has been extremely active in all things first district over his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| He's active in the Dangers Avenue Neighborhood Association, one of our strongest neighborhood associations in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| He's active with the Abette Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| He and I kind of joke around in that we're kind of kindred spirits in that we have a brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| He has one brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| I have two that are a little more famous than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| His brother is a bishop in the AME Zion Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| And so with that said, he's also been extremely active in this whole process of zonings and districting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:12| So I'd like to nominate Dan Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| Move they cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Daniel Brown is my nomination also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| There's been a motion to cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| The nominations, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=4712)|

| 1:25:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| You don't want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5159)|

| 1:27:21| Set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| Page 14, 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| I've got one right in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| On page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| An initial resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee authorizing and incurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| not to exceed $30 million of interest-bearing bond anticipation notes for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| notes for Knox County, Tennessee, providing the details thereof, authorizing the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| and application of proceeds thereof, and providing for the payment of principal thereof and interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| This is Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| Finance, 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| 7-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Ed, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| I wanted to ask John one or two questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:20| If we could, we'd discuss this briefly at a finance and just something going $30 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:28| in the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| I just wanted to get it on the floor and take it off consent briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| I don't oppose it, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| John, we're going out with $30 million and $50 million that we refinanced, that we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| I guess last month, and then some additional debt, too, later on in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| And these are just the bond anticipation notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| This piece, there's two resolutions that make up the one bond issue for $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Could you give us just a snapshot of what some of that debt's for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| Is it schools or is it libraries or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| It includes all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| It includes schools, libraries, some building renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| It's just what's a mixture of things that are already appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| We're not asking for any appropriations, and this just funds existing appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| Do you anticipate buying insurance on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| We have planned a ratings conference call with both Moody's and Standard & Poor's and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| with our bond rating, the most recent bond rating upgrade, we feel that it's not cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| beneficial to do the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| And that upgrade is to AA Plus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| What kind of interest rate do you think you'll pay or will pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| I don't want to speculate too much on this, but I think we're going to get an extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| favorable rate and we're going to a two-year fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| So it's going to be, we're going to lock in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| We expect to go to market on the other issue here about the first of April, the first week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| This would be a little bit behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| It might be in May and dependent on the market conditions in May, but I'm very optimistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| that we'll get, we'll lock in on a very favorable fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| And this would just be to, we're talking about Labor Day, wasn't that the timeframe you talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| about for the bond, for the notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| And then take it long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| My expectation is that we would go out and put it out there for a two-year, but we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| have the option to call it early and then it's our anticipation that we would incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| that into a current year capital plan and then we would go ahead and repay it once the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| capital plan was approved, the bond issues were approved, and it takes about 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| into the new year to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| And with this, am I correct in saying this would put us at $643 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| And that's without taking into consideration the amount that we would pay down in principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| for the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| So we'll have some retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| So $643 is probably pretty less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| We're going to pay down about $24 million in principle, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| We got $620, $619, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| How much has our bonded indebtedness gone up in the last six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| I don't have a number right in front of me, but Commissioner Schall has talked about we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| started this year at 613, we're going to add this piece to it and then reduce it by what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| we paid in principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| But yeah, I don't have numbers for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| You don't have any idea at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| You know, I hate to add up in front of 19 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| I'd rather give you, go back and check the numbers and give you the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| Well, I believe it's up around 51% over the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I would say that you've already checked the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Mr. Troy, we've got some new commissioners and you mentioned schools and libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| Can you tell us what schools, libraries that you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Yeah, I mean, we still have to, even though Hardin Valley is open for business, not all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| the bills are paid and so this is going to finish out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| We're still finishing out Powell Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| We've got some improvements in Lawson McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| We've got some road construction improvements and a number of other building improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| that we've done around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Yeah, I just wanted to say I voted for these projects, so I'm going to vote for this debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| But things have changed over the last two years since I've been elected and I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| to put you guys on notice that I'll be looking for a very, very lean budget when budget time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| comes around again because the economic conditions have certainly changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| Commissioner, you're exactly right and we're all going to be looking at that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| Just out of curiosity, how does our bond indebtedness compare to other communities in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| or other similarly sized communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| And that's part of why the bond rating process is so important is that they have professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| through Moody's and Standard & Poor's and they're in the business of comparing us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| other organizations, other cities and counties across the state and just this past June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| Standard & Poor's felt that Knox County earned an increase in their bond rating because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| compared favorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Okay, so we can intuit that from the rating, but the exact numbers you don't have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Commissioner Pinkston, is your motion for 802 and 803?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| No, I didn't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Okay, we'll do it for 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| 802, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| There's two resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5625)|

| 1:35:20| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Well, the only reason I asked this to be pulled and chatted about briefly is to remind our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| nonprofits of what's changing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| to be pulled and chatted about briefly, it's just to remind our nonprofits of what's changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| here. That we, in fact, are, I suppose there's some reason in law that we're obliged to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| this. Is that correct, Law Director? Yes, sir. Okay. So those, even if it's as simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| as you want, you know, a couple hundred bucks for a school field trip or for your neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| organization, you're going to have to specifically write a written request now. Is that a fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| statement? Yes, sir, Commissioner. We attached an Exhibit A to the policy, tried to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5756)|
| 1:36:04| it as simple as possible, but take care of all of the elements that have to be complied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| with in the state statute. And so just fair warning to all those very worthy things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| we each give small sums to. We've had to add a level of complexity, but contact your county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| commissioners for the appropriate form. Commissioner Burroughs? I have a question if schools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:31| in any way exempt from filling out this form and turning in all of the required supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| documentation? I don't know of any reason that they, they're not exempted under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| state statute. And this is more of a, the statute applies more toward the disbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:54| of the funds as opposed to the recipient. This information that's on the exhibit, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5814)|
| 1:37:03| has to be filled out, there are asterisks by the paragraphs that the statute requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| And so there is no, to answer your question, Commissioner, there is no specific exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:20| Commissioner Burroughs? Yes, I have a question. In my reading, and I'm not an attorney and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| some of this legalese, you know, goes over a poor boy's head sometime, but the way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| read it, that anybody who got these funds had to be qualified as a 501c3 corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:40| or entity to receive funds now? What about these little, you know, I know in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:49| it's been like maybe a small homeowner's group that were doing a project at a school and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| you know, we wanted to give them a couple hundred dollars or a little league ball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| or something like that. These people are not organized and they're not a 501c3. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| this mean we can't help these folks anymore? The statute, the state statute, is specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| designed to address two types of charitable organizations. A civic organization or a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:21| simply a non-profit corporation. The statute is silent, Commissioner, as to whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:30| not it would or would not apply to a small community type organization that has not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:40| that was formed for a particular purpose, that has not filed for, under the Internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:47| Revenue Code to qualify as a 501c3. Well, you know, when I look at some of the monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:56| that have gone out in the past, and you can get those records, I mean, I'm sure you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| them there too, that there are a lot of small groups, as I mentioned, the ball teams or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| a homeowner's group or others that have been given money in the past. I just don't be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| that we're not cutting them out somehow because if you added up all the dollars, a good portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5951)|
| 1:39:18| of those discretionary funds go to these types of people, you know, volunteers in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| that we're trying to help out or volunteer groups in the community that we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| to help out. And for some way that we can continue this, I want to be sure that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| do that some way. I don't think that there is a prohibition on you doing it. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| they have to complete the form. If you look at the Section 3 of the policy, in Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:50| A, it talks about a non-profit charitable organization. And that language comes directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| from the statute. It doesn't make reference to the Internal Revenue Code. All it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| is it's one in which no part of the net earnings in yours or may lawfully inure to the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| of any private shareholder or individual and that provides services benefiting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| general welfare of the residents of the county. So I think if the group does that, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| they could be the recipient, but they still need to comply with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| But they still have to fill out a financial report. Some of these groups may not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:32| a bank account. I mean, the only funds they have might be what we give them. They don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| have a running, standing bank account. Are they still going to have to fill out the financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:43| reports and everything that are required in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| They have to disclose what information is available. And so you would look at the Exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:52| A that requires what be disclosed and make what is available available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6052)|
| 1:41:00| I just want to be sure that everyone understands this, that those small groups out there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| might have contacted your commissioner before, that you still can do that. It's just a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| bit different process. Because the way it reads, you know, the general first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| of it, it looks like you have to be a 501c3 to be able to get any money at all. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| know that probably 75% of the ones that get discretionary funds are not 501c3 entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:30| So that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| I guess I'll just continue that dialogue in that when I look at these on Exhibit A01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:45| it says the asterisk things are required. And you're saying, number five, that an annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:53| audit be completed within the second part and an annual report detailing it. Now, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6113)|
| 1:42:02| language is what the Tennessee State Annual Report normally requires. I mean, this looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:11| like, you know, what a nonprofit or a 501c3, either public or private, has to submit each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| year. So I just, if that's not what the law is saying explicitly, I think we need to explicitly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| say that here, that that's not what we're looking for. Because I'm in agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| Commissioner Brown in that a lot of the organizations that I give money now, they can account for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| the dollars. They can account for whatever they've done over the last year. But they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| probably not, I mean, I'd say half are probably not organized. They're a ball team or they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| a youth group that won't have this information. So I just need to clearly understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| guidance I need to give them. Do I tell them to fill this exhibit out as completely as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| they possibly can and then we submit it for funding and we're done? Or is there anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:07| else that I need to tell them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| I think that is what you need to tell them, Commissioner. For example, in paragraph five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| on the exhibit A, the reason it has an asterisk by it is because that is one of the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:22| that is specifically mentioned in the Tennessee Code annotated. Now, we tried to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:31| we tried to simplify it because we realized that there were deserving organizations in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| the community that might not qualify or have attempted to qualify as charitable organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:44| under the Internal Revenue Code, but as you describe, a community baseball team. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:52| would not, five asks for a copy of the last annual audit. Well, they wouldn't have a last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| annual audit. Or an annual report detailing all receipts and expenditures. There would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:05| be no such document. So I think you would just note on there, no such document exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| or non-applicable. And that would be doing the best that you can do in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:23| The reason I say it's a one-size-fits-all is because this same form is being used by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| section B in paragraph three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| Mr. Law Director, would there not be some way that we could just vote on this like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| did the Moreland Heights school issue here a little earlier? You know, if I have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| discretionary funds, I just bring it before the Commission and let's vote on whether to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| give it or not. Like we did Moreland Heights a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| There's nothing to prevent that. The reason the policy, we put the overall policy together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| the way we did is because there is the additional requirement in the statute that each disbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:15| be noticed and published in a newspaper of general circulation. And if we did those on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| a case-by-case basis, then it's going to be very difficult for both the Commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:29| those organizations. So we thought to try to make the process as orderly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:37| the executive branch and Commission who have funds available to disburse, they would comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:45| with the same deadline every month that exists for getting amendments or additions to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:53| agenda. So if there's a deserving organization, you would get the information together, submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6353)|
| 1:46:01| it by that deadline, that way it could be considered, voted on, the notice could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:12| taken care of by the Knox County Clerk's Office, and it would be done once a month. If we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:18| them on an individual basis, then the Clerk's Office is going to have to publish notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| on every single one as it comes up. It just seemed like that was very unwieldy. But this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:31| policy that we put together is nothing more than a proposal. Y'all can change it however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| you deem best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| Well, you know, the newspaper gets it, the media does, through our agenda. If it's put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| on the agenda, so they would get it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| But they don't necessarily publish each one. And then there's a time lag on sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6410)|
| 1:47:01| you know, on, as I said, if you can ensure, we're trying to ensure that we meet the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:10| of the statute. And the main things that we were concerned about was the notice and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| publication aspect. And then that all of the information that is in this Exhibit A is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:25| of that. That has to be on record. So we wanted to have a policy that ensured that all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:33| that information made its way to the public as part of this disbursement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:41| Question. What would be the starting process for Mrs. Jones' Little League softball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6461)|
| 1:47:49| here that wanted to get $200 to help buy some balls? Where is she going to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6469)|
| 1:47:57| There's various ways, but this money is made available, as I understand it, through Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| and through the Mayor's Office. So you, members of Commission, have this form available. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:12| if you are approached by what you consider to be a deserving neighborhood group or civic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| group, you would hand them the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| That's one I want to know. You mentioned a minute ago with the Clerk's Office, but what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| I want to know is, you know, suppose that she comes to me and says, I want this, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| like to request this money. And I say, OK, that sounds like a good deal to me, so I hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| her a form. Who do I bring it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| If you look at the policy, Commissioner Brown, it says that all those who would seek to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:48| recipients of this money would complete and submit either to the County Mayor or the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:56| County, I'm reading from 3.1, eligibility requirements, either to the Mayor or the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6536)|
| 1:49:04| this Exhibit A. So that's how you would start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:12| OK, but we need, this information needs to be given to the public in some way so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:20| they know how to go about this, too. So is that going to be up to each of us to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| when they come and ask us? Or are we going to get some kind of a publicity notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6567)|
| 1:49:34| on it? Or, you know, my concern is we're upsetting the apple cart and I don't want to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| small people left out because they feel like it's too much trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| I understand. All we're trying to do is comply with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| And we, if you want to, and I think that's a good idea, if the Commission thinks it wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:58| to publish this policy so that it's out there, it can be put on the, I think an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:07| way to do it would be to put it on the Knox County website with the form so that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| available to anybody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| If you do that, I think that it still needs, that should come back through each commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| for the district. I think that's why I was trying to get to a while ago that there needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| to be a process and I think if it's in your district, it needs to come back to you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| then you handle it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| I think what's anticipated, and the reason we say it would be, it would come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| the Mayor's Office or the Commission, is if there was a deserving entity in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| they would approach you, you could make the form available or tell them it's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| online, they could complete it, give you the form, and then you could deliver it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| Commission office. And that would constitute them applying for the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:58| Works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| Is this a new law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| Yes, sir. Well, actually it's not brand new. It came to our attention and I think when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:12| we, we began making inquiries across the state and apparently it had kind of gone under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:21| radar and nobody knew about it. I think we are the first, there are others that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:28| a policy, but I think their policy existed prior to the statute and was not geared to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| comply with the statute. Knox County is one of the first to put a policy in place designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:42| to comply with the requirements of the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| What happened to our charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| It's too much hassle for a little small organization to get $100. In my opinion, it's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:56| Maybe we could suggest to our Knox County Legislative Delegation that for amounts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:04| are under a certain threshold amount that they be excluded from these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| Where does our charter fall in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| That's what I can't understand about the charter and state law. Sometimes our charter overrules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| sometimes the state law overrules. I just can't get this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| The charter just doesn't address this in any respect. There's a state law that makes these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| requirements. The charter is silent on them except for the fact that this is the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| legislative body and in that role take action in order to comply with the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:45| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Could we do this as an either or that we could either have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| them fill out this form or we bring it to commission to vote on individually? Could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| that be our policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| If that's what commission decides will work best, you certainly have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:09| Are you putting it in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Do we have a motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:13| I'll do that as a form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| Just explain that right quick, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| Make sure that we're compliant. So that either we comply by either following the policy as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| is with the form or that this commission will follow what state statute says with bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6808)|
| 1:53:35| it before this body to be voted as an individual. Say if you wanted organization ABC to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:44| X number of dollars out of the funds that you have available to you that you bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6824)|
| 1:53:51| right here we have it published and whatever other requirements to fulfill the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6831)|
| 1:54:00| by bringing it forth before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| So that would mean we would need to put it on the agenda and we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| Of course, it will go through the committee and we'll go through commission meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6848)|
| 1:54:15| then we're done. That'll be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| Just like Moreland Heights, just like what we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Just like what the city does, sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| All of the information that is required would, of course, have to be a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:32| What information would still be required? The same information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| The information...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:36| So we're not saving...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| We're not doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| So then we're not saving all the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| Let me try to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| Exhibit A to the policy. The reason there is an Exhibit A is because the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:53| requires that the information that is requested in Exhibit A be part of what is published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6893)|
| 1:55:01| in a newspaper of general circulation before the money is disbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| If we just follow this policy and it doesn't come before this body, I guess that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| I'm confused, then does it have to be or not have to be published?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:21| It must be published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Regardless if it would vote on by this body or if it's just simply the forms filled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:30| and then is it approved by whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| It doesn't have to be. To comply with the state statute, you have to give permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:42| to public notice in a newspaper of general circulation and the notice must contain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:50| information that's on Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| So regardless if it came before us or not, that will have all this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| So my motion, by adding the either or doesn't save any steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| In fact, it adds two. It adds a step. So then I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| We already have a motion. It would have been a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| I'll withdraw whatever I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| That's just adding another step to something we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| I make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| I've got a question or just more clarification. Commissioner Hammond, I'm going to use you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| for my guinea pig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| All right. Let's say the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| The way that you're saying this is that we're going to approve the budget in July and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| if it's going to be on the website and each of us have $6,000, well then what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| to stop people from all of us getting slammed with all these wanting money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| And it's going to embarrass us as commissioners to say, well, say I've got a ball team down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7010)|
| 1:56:57| your way and I put in for $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| And you don't want to embarrass the people up there and say, well, you know, we're used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| to giving $250 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I don't want to put a commissioner in a bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| I think it's the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| The commissioners in each district know what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| Like I've got some schools in my district, I ask them, where do you want that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| Do you want it early or do you want it at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| And these, I've got three schools left that I'm giving money to before the budget is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| And if somebody's already gone on and said, hey, I want the money for this, this, or this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| you know, I don't want to embarrass them and say, well, I've got it for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| I don't want to put us, we may be backing ourselves in a corner with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7050)|
| 1:57:38| You see what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| Because you may have people come up first, you know, within a month, our budget's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| And you don't want to embarrass the other people, you know, who can have money and who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| As I said earlier, this policy was proposed solely to put Knox County in compliance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7072)|
| 1:58:03| a state statute that requires this publication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| If you look at section 4.3 of the proposed policy, it talks about the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| And it says that, you know, the appropriation, the disbursement may not be made unless and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:23| until notice has been published in a newspaper or general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| I mean, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| It's an open record who I give the money to and stand behind everybody that I do give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| the money to and plan to give money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| I just don't want to back us in a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| This is a lot of hassle to give someone a hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| It most certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| It makes no sense whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| I would like to make a motion to defer this to the law director, find some way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| I'd recommend against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| We've got neighborhood groups there that still need the cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| So that deferring only puts them in a bind where they can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| So I would recommend against it, Paul, for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| Now, I'll second it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| How about defer it until he comes back with some way to make it easier next month for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| us to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| But he's saying there is no easier way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| How about if we put a 30-day, we implement this for 30 days while he goes out and tries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| to get more understanding on what other entities are doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| Because one of the things, forgive me, we're always kind of out front on these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| and there might be a reason that other organizations are kind of taking a wait-and-see or other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| counties and cities are taking a wait-and-see attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| I'm like you, Mr. McKinney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| I'll have PTAs at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Somebody will call me and say, we're trying to raise money and we've got to have it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| two weeks from now and things like that, and it just seems to me like it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| a lot of trouble when, like you say, they're asking for $100, like Commissioner Strickland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| There has to be some way around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| It looks to me like we could have put a monetary figure on it anyway, a higher figure than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| like $500 that we have to fill a form out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| Well, it seems like at this point in time we have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| We can't do anything at least for another month, so we're going to have to abide by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| this until maybe the law director can find, maybe, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| You don't have to implement this policy, but you do have to comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| And you can't disperse any of these monies until the notice takes place that's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:36| by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| So you've got these groups out there who are asking for the money, but until you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| a policy in place, they can't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| If you disperse it, you will be violating state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| So it's up to you what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| The statute is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| You have the forms ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| The forms are attached to the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| Mr. Chairman, is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| There's a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| Is there more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| I'm going to go back to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| I just see people talking without turning on lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| Well, I let it go, so the lights were on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| You're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| Commissioner Hammond is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| A couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| Mr. Law Director, do we have to publish this twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| As I read this, under public notice, it says that we are to publish the intent to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| the appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| Then under 4.5, it says once the award has been made, that we will publish in a newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:46| general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| We have to publish it twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| No, you don't have to publish it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| Once a decision is made, then obviously there's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| So it's one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| It only has to be published once per disbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| We were trying to put this process in place where there would be a deadline for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:10| the applications once a month to ensure that the clerk's office wasn't bombarded with different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:19| ones every day, and so the commission wouldn't be bombarded with them on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| There is a fee for this, too, right, to put it in the newspaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| You have to pay the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| There is a move in the General Assembly now to allow governmental bodies to put these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| things on their websites, and that would be legal notification and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| So I would suggest that we contact our members of the General Assembly and ask that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| pass that, because that would make it a lot simpler and cheaper to be able to put it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| our governmental website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| That would really cure the main problem, because the main compliance issue is not getting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| information from the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| It's getting it out there and giving this public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| And if the law allowed us to do that on our website, it would really simplify this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| Do you guys need a workshop on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| Well, I would like to say that I would like to, if I can, put an amendment on this that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:24| we ask our legislative delegation to please pass some legislation that groups who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| requesting less than a certain amount, say $500, $750, however much, not be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:39| to go through this process, because it seems to me like we don't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| We have to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| I have schools and groups that are waiting for money, and I want to get it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| So I feel like we have to pass this to be in compliance with the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| But that maybe in the future we might be able to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| We couldn't do that with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| It would have to be a separate resolution if you're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| An amendment to that wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| If you'll make that as a substitute motion, I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| Can I make that as an amendment to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| I don't see any reason why not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| It's up to Commissioner Pinkston and Norman if they agree to that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Do you accept it, Commissioner Norman, as a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| As a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| You second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| It's been so long you forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| Come on, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Do you want a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| I was just going to bring up the point that Commissioner Hammond already did about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| cost of publishing it, and I know that that doesn't come cheap, and yeah, I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:51| what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| If we can put it on our website, but I'm still confused with the issue that if Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7492)|
| 2:05:00| X fills out this paperwork and we send it out there, what body is approving this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:08| Is it just an automatic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| Does the mayor's office approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| Is there a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| Is there a commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| The way this has been done in the past, this money is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:22| of the budget that's appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| That I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| But it's not earmarked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| Per group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| So the money is already available, so you don't have to come back and get each disbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:37| approved by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| It's just that to comply with the state statute, there is this notice requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| So once the requirements of the public notice are met, then the money can be dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7544)|
| 2:05:54| So if a commissioner submits this information, and once it's all gathered, and I guess who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7554)|
| 2:06:06| going to sign off that all the information is here and that it's going to be legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| disbursable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| Does your office say that we have everything to comply and allow that check to be cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| The way this policy is set up is the Exhibit A is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| The Exhibit A will either come through the mayor's office or commission, depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| who's making the disbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| It will then go to the clerk's office, who's in charge of publication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:39| Say we'll publish it or put it on the website if that becomes an available source, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Who decides whether or not we've complied with everything in order to have that check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| Well, as I said, that's why we designed this Exhibit A the way we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:58| We included the asterisk so you would know what information is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7618)|
| 2:07:06| If that information is filled out on the form, that's what the clerk is going to publish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:15| That is what will be published, and that's what the law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:22| I understand that's what the law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| Now, who's going to decide when to cut that check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| Will the finance department, because they're going to be the one cutting the check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| The way it's designed, you may or may not recall, during committee meetings, I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:37| discussion with Mr. Troyer, and the way we had originally drafted it is the checks would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:45| be issued seven days after publication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| That creates a burden for the finance department, along with everything else they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:58| Mr. Troyer requested that it be amended to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| So the way it's set up is the clerk gives notice to the finance department when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:11| notice takes place, and then the check will be issued within 30 days of the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7691)|
| 2:08:21| There's a line for approval authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| Who signs that on the exhibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| The bottom line says approval authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| Whose signature goes there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| If it's from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| The commissioner who has the discretion to make that disbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7712)|
| 2:08:41| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| Commissioner Burroughs, were you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| Get out of the floor then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| So you're saying that it's up to the individual commissioner before we turn this in to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7730)|
| 2:08:56| commission office to make sure that all of those things are included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| So it's our responsibility to make sure that they fill it out right, have all the applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| We make sure that's all correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| We sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| We give it to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| The commission office sends it to the clerk's office, who publishes it publicly, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:19| they send it to the finance department, who cuts the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| That's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| But it's still up to us to decide whether or not the group gets the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| It's always been that way in the past anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Now we just have this extra layer of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| Of bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| Extra hundred layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| Mr. King-Pingston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| Would it save the county any money if anybody that's wanting to disburse any money to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| it up at the agenda meeting, and then every one of those be listed in the same ad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| Like if I want to give $100 to Moreland High School, and Mr. Brown wants to give $100 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| Bonnie Kate, and just run one little ad, and then seven days after that, get the checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:09| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Doesn't that already repeat the issue that Commissioner Luthal went through and figured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| out it wouldn't help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| I understand your concern, Commissioner, and that's what we've tried to do by saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| these have to be in by the agenda deadline each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| We're trying to ensure that, let's say, ten of them come in, then they would all be published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:37| in the same ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| That's what I was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| I want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| I don't want to come up in the middle of the month, somebody come up in the middle of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| month, and then the clerk's office has to pay another...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| No, it would have to go over to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| We have a motion on the floor with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| Still ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| And that was as amended by Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7856)|
| 2:11:05| Commissioner Burroughs' amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| 9-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, approving a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:15| with Summit Medical Group, PLLC, for a rest or durst to provide health coaching services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| Resolution 9-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7881)|

| 2:11:23| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| I move and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| Yeah, I guess I have a question on an R.N. to provide health coaching services for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7890)|
| 2:11:43| County employees enrolled in one of the Knox County government self-funded medical plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| My question would be, what is the cost that they're going to be paying this R.N.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| And how many people is this really going to be affecting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7914)|
| 2:12:03| The total cost for the first year in the contract is $100,800, and that would cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:22| one full-time registered nurse, one backup nurse for vacation relief, and one physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| for medical oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Frances, I need your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| Frances Fogerson, Director of Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:39| If you're asking specifically how much is broken down for just the registered nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| I don't have a contract in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| I believe it's in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| I think that is $60,000 for that particular component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:57| That sounds a bit high for a coach and R.N. coaching staff to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7977)|
| 2:13:05| How many employees are we talking about that they're going to be helping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| Well, I can't tell you exactly how many they will be helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| This is a voluntary program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| Among the people that are on our insurance that are identified as having a chronic medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, those persons will be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:29| known to this nurse who will not be a Knox County employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| That person will contact those patients, and it will be a voluntary program for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8014)|
| 2:13:42| participate in health coaching, monitoring, education services, certainly trying to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| them improve their condition so that it doesn't progress to a more unhealthful situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:57| Well, I guess I have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| Anybody that's got a severe diabetes, high blood pressure, they're under the care of an internal medicine doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:06| or a specialist dealing with diabetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:12| And this R.N. is not going to be able to prescribe medicine or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| And if there is a problem, this R.N. would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| I guess I have a real problem with Knox County providing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:27| I see this as, particularly in this time of budget crunch and all, these Knox County employees have their insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:35| they have their regular doctors, and I know if it was me with a severe high blood pressure problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:43| you've either got to get it under control and do what your doctors tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| I mean, I'm going to the doctor's office if I'm having a severe problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| I just don't see this being beneficial to Knox County at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| Also, I'd like to know, was it bidded out to anybody else besides...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| This isn't anything against Summit Medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| Was it bidded out to any other companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| It was RFP out and received three bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| Summit was the winner in this bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| Is there anybody in here that is with our insurance, on the insurance committee for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| I just think this is a very...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| $100,000 a year for three years, I think, for a total over $307,000 is a lot of money right now to hire an orient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:33| I think that the research will show that you certainly gain your money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| We are a self-funded insurance program, and certainly our goal in this is to keep employees healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8138)|
| 2:15:45| to try to provide interventions, coaching, monitoring, additional educational help as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8145)|
| 2:15:53| to help them not progress to more serious levels of their disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| This is somewhat similar, a more abbreviated version of the program that the city has had in place for a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| and is a model used by other companies in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| This isn't a new model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| No, I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| I'm not convinced of how well these policies are really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| Let me just say that an ICU nurse over at the University of Tennessee that's dealing with life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| and death every second, working 12 hours straight, is not making that kind of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:33| If there's somebody here with the insurance that wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| I'm just saying that is a high salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| If we can get an account of how many employees of Knox County are actually going to benefit from this service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:46| that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| But if it's only 50 people, that's a pretty good paying job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:59| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Ms. Fogerson, is this nurse going to be providing physicals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| Are we doing blood work and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| Or is this lady just giving advice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| No, this is education, monitoring, dietary advice, case management services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| linking with a primary care physician, could provide smoking cessation classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:23| Is all that not already provided through Bright Starts and the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| Not at this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| Bright Starts doesn't cover that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| Now, we do provide some, but this is targeted to identified high risk chronic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:40| I'm part of the city program, so I kind of understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| Are all these people required to take a physical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| See, in the city you're required to take a physical and do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| Is there any requirement for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| No, this does not have a health risk assessment component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| So we're just hoping these people show up to get advice from this lady?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| They will be contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| How do we have their information that they're contacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| We have their information through their medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| When I say we, please don't think that I know the coding of your doctor visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:09| but it is known by our insurance company which patients are being treated for particular conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8289)|
| 2:18:19| I kind of share Commissioner Carringer's, we have Bright Starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| which is a very helpful program to help people be more aware of their insurance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:29| They have their, I just, you know, Dr. Briggs has brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| it's $8,400 a month for administrative costs and for the nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| And I just, I agree that it's something that could be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| but we're counting on employees to show up that don't have to show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| and we all have Bright Starts in the health department to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| And another point that I wanted to make, the health department could be the overseeing physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| so we shouldn't have to pay someone medical for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| And so I just think that there's $100,000, if it wasn't voted prior into the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8336)|
| 2:19:02| I think that we could probably revisit this at a later time, but $100,000 is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:10| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| I think I'm one of those high-risk people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| I have a little blood pressure and a little cholesterol and very early stages of diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| I take a medication for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| I go to my doctor four times a year, and he takes my blood work, and he coaches me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8366)|
| 2:19:33| He tells me if I lose a little weight that some of these things might get under control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:39| and he's right about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| So I get my coaching session every three months when I go to my physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| What is this nurse going to do that my family physician isn't already doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8388)|
| 2:19:55| I congratulate you for seeing your family physician that number of times per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| but I don't know that each of our patients or our employees with chronic conditions is receiving that level of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:08| or has that degree of conscientiousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| We certainly hope that this health coach would be what the name says, a health coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:16| would provide that encouragement, that additional level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| perhaps spend some time that the physician isn't able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| I'm going to have to concur with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| If a person is not, and if a person is on medications for blood pressure and cholesterol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| their liver enzymes have to be monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| That's why you go in and get some blood taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| If a person is not going to take their follow-up visits with their doctor to make sure, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8441)|
| 2:20:47| their medicines are doing the trick, and number two, that their medicines aren't harming their liver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| if they're not going to do that, then I don't necessarily see that they're going to go to this nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8452)|
| 2:20:59| And we've got a really tough budget year coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| The school system is already announcing that teachers are going to be laid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| and I just don't see that in this current environment that we need to spend $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| for someone else to tell me I'm fat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8473)|
| 2:21:21| I'm sure anybody here, you're welcome to pass that information on to me any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:30| May I make the comment that we would not be presenting this to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| if we didn't think that there would be some savings in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| Will we recoup the $100,000 the first three months or six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| Certainly hope we recoup it the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| I would certainly hope that the second year we'll see even greater savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| You know, our goal is to make sure that the employees who have high cholesterol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| and high blood pressure don't progress to the heart attack and the stroke stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| I'm just really very quickly going to make a statement that I'm going to need to recuse myself from this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:09| Probably half my business or more is with Summit Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| and I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment or vote on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| So I'm recusing myself from the vote in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| I think we would like to hear your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| You're a professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| Commissioner Browse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| Frances, do you have the research available for any other county or city that's doing this sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:36| that shows what percentage of their employees actually use the service and what the savings actually are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8556)|
| 2:22:44| I don't have utilizations with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| We do have some figures from the city that shows taking the acute care out of the component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8568)|
| 2:23:01| and just doing the chronic care that they were projecting savings of $110,000 the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:08| $205,000 the second year, and $411,000 the third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:15| That's projected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| That's projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| That's not actually been proven yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| That's just what they're projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:30| I cannot say that with certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| I'm looking at a table here, medical savings to be realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| This is out of an RFP they have for adding additional staff to their center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:50| How long have they had their program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| Their program is, who's got the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8635)|
| 2:23:59| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Mr. Browse has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| I can't answer how long they've had their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| They've had their program several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| Okay, well, what I would like to see before I vote on this is research that demonstrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8648)|
| 2:24:15| that this will give us the savings over the next three years that we fund it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| and that the savings are substantial enough to warrant spending this much money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| I think that, and as someone who also has chronic conditions, I see my physician regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8666)|
| 2:24:34| and if you have a chronic condition and you don't, I don't think you would be inclined to go visit an RN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:40| I also am concerned that the RN would be, if I were a county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8680)|
| 2:24:46| and an RN came knocking at my door and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| your insurance company told me you have a chronic illness, let's sit down and talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| I'd be a little angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| I would feel like maybe my privacy had been compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| I also think that if this person is not eligible to dispense medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| or give any true diagnosis or anything like that, can an LPN do just as well as an RN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8706)|
| 2:25:16| Do we have to pay an RN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| Because they generally are paid at a higher rate than an LPN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| We were seeking a person that also has certification in occupational health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8722)|
| 2:25:28| or case management as well as the registered nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| Ken, if we defer this for 30 days, can you get that research together for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| I would like to offer a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| You're probably moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| Thank you, Ms. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| Hi, folks, and I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| The key word to me is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| That's if they want to take advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| My fear is that we will be paying a coach to come and half the day they'll be sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:11| and they won't be having anyone come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| And I don't know that to be the case, but that's just my fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| I can't vote to support this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| I can't vote to support this in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| I can't vote to support this in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| And the reason I can't is because of the voluntary aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| When we're laying off teachers and we're in this kind of economic environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| for me to vote to spend $100,000 on a health coach that may or may not be busy and do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:38| I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| And so I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| I appreciate it, and I understand the thought process behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| There could very well be some savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| But right now, given the scenario that we're in, I just can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| So I just wanted to make that known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| Yes, Mike, Arms, I'll let you say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| Mike Arms, Chief of Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| Just wanted to make a comment as to why this is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| Keep this in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| We're self-insured at $20 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| Three out of four of our plans are losing money, losing money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| which means at some point in time we're going to have to either cut benefits or raise premiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| or ask the taxpayer to pay the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| So we can't go get stimulus money from the federal government to make our insurance plan whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8844)|
| 2:27:31| So, again, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| $20 million, self-insured, three out of four plans are losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| We either got to cut benefits, increase premiums, or get the taxpayer to pay the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:45| Frances' team was just looking at models that are working to try to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8865)|
| 2:27:52| Ten percent of our employees are eating up 50 percent of our medical costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8872)|
| 2:27:59| And you're aware of those ratios, that your worst cases are the ones that are eating into that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:06| So we're just looking at creative ways, out-of-the-box ways to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| And I know it's difficult to think, man, we're spending $100,000 to try to save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:17| but this is just a creative look at something we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| And I appreciate another 30 days or 60 days to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| And we may look at other ways to try to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| but this is something that we've got to address at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| Or this commission is going to be asked to face that issue of telling employees you're going to cut their benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| or raise their premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| Mike, can I ask Jim a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| I still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8926)|
| 2:28:52| Either Mike or whoever wants to answer this question, and I'm trying to read this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8932)|
| 2:28:58| We're not hiring or are we hiring a nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| or are we contracting with Summit to provide nursing care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8942)|
| 2:29:08| And when I look at number 14 of the contract, it says $8,000 per month for health coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| including physician oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| So does it include a physician as well in case a nurse that is contacting these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:25| needs that oversight or needs some type of assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| I'll let Frances answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8969)|
| 2:29:45| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| I'm Lisa Ware Ellington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| I'm Director of Integrated Health Services with Summit Medical Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| and I really appreciate the comments I've heard so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| Let me explain just a little bit more about the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| Maybe it will become more clear for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| What we're finding, and, of course, we're a large physician group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| and our physicians have had many committees and spent two years creating this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9001)|
| 2:30:06| The purpose for the model is when most folks go to visit their physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| they have three to five minutes to spend with the physician to learn about their disease state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| That's really not enough to get a long-term impact necessarily for a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| Now, many people do understand they can spend that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| and they know what they need to go out and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| Many people do not, and I can tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| For diabetes, for example, an out-of-control diabetic costs over $80,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| national studies show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| An in-control diabetic is more like $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| That's where you start to see the cost containment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| The price for our services includes a whole lot more than just an RN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| We have developed protocols for all of the disease states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| from heart failure, asthma, GERD, and diabetes, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| There are several disease states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| Our physicians have spent over a year developing protocols to address those disease states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| that work in conjunction with what the primary care physician is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| Letters go back to that primary care physician to keep them in touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| with what's going on with their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| but we have found that by meeting with employees once a month is what we usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| Sometimes once every two weeks for a chronic person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| That that person can do goal setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| and check on that goal setting every month that goes by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| and just try to bring them in compliance so they are also more productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:33| Presenteeism goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| There are many advantages to these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| but it's a whole lot more than just a nurse that's sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| We've got a program that shows great participation rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| We'll work with the folks from the county on incentive programs and things as time goes by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| but just the way it stands today, we would stratify your population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| and not only look at your chronic disease folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| but a lot of the times the folks that are at risk that may not even know they're at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| they're your claims yet to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| Those are the claims that are going to hit two, three, five years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| if you can get those folks in compliance as well or have them reduce their disease state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| and we would develop programs for that should it be weight loss, smoking cessation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9132)|
| 2:32:17| more information on lipids for high cholesterol, looking at generics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| It's all the whole plethora of things that would be on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| and I just wanted to comment, you know, I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| I would think the same way, but it's a whole lot more than an RN sitting in a room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| Well, that's what I was trying to, because, you know, my wife is an RN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| and I know what an RN makes here in Knox County, and it's nowhere near this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9157)|
| 2:32:44| So that's why I had the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| Are you hiring just an RN to sit there and take care of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| or if there was more, and it sounds like there is more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| especially if you're going to have physician oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| and then there's $400 a month administration professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| I appreciate you coming up and explaining that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| but I do have some questions for Mike or someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| At one time, Mike, we were looking at having sort of a clinic for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:21| Have we sort of scrapped that idea and sort of think that maybe it's shifted towards this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:25| or is this sort of an in place of, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:29| We looked at that last year, and I'll let Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| This is sort of in place of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| We looked at that last year, and I think maybe our insurance committee really didn't buy into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| and that would obviously be more costly, a clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| Well, that's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| Maybe this wasn't in place of doing that idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| because that sort of didn't look like it didn't have a lot of support, I know, here on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9225)|
| 2:33:51| So this is a cheaper way of doing, trying to achieve that same goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| Probably a more cost-effective way, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| it goes back to this looking at ways to reduce our insurance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| Let's say an employee is one of these, that they're a diabetic or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| Would they actually go into some medical, an office setting somewhere, or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9250)|
| 2:34:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| We intend to have a space for her in this building, he or she,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| and also some off-site locations depending on where the need is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| So, no, you wouldn't leave and go to a summit office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| There would be an office here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9275)|
| 2:34:39| Now, we keep talking about an RN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| Would they have, like, take one of their RNs that they have on staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| and have them be assigned, this is their assignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:53| And it would be the same one all the time, or would they be rotating out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| Except for vacation relief, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| So then they would just bring in like a substitute during?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| Frances, will they do health assessments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| No, this does not have the health risk assessment component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:15| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| Yeah, I'd like to hear from Tim Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| I think he came down a few minutes ago and asked for somebody from insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| So, Tim, let's hear your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| My name is Tim Wheeler, 3539 Black Oak Ridge Lane here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| Less than two years ago, this body formed an insurance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9330)|
| 2:35:34| and this was what you all directed us to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| And I can tell you the committee itself has not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9337)|
| 2:35:42| We knew nothing about the RFP that's gone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| They've already taken the bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| They're ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| We have discussed this at our last insurance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| We discussed using our county health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| because it is already being funded by the taxpayers of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| and therefore that was to come back, but we have not met since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| I question whether or not this RFP should have gone out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| forbid, without the insurance committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| unless you all, as Commissioner, dissolved this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| that the members were not notified of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| And that's my biggest complaint with this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| Do you have something else, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| Yeah, I just want to, Tim, do you think if we put it off for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| that maybe the insurance committee could get with Ms. Fogley and look at it or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9386)|
| 2:36:31| Commissioner Harmon, I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| Mr. Lockett is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| He could probably tell you a little better than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| But if the insurance committee is the one that is supposed to handle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| as Commission charged us to do with all insurance matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| when Knox County was going self-funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| I would question whether this RFP is the one that is supposed to be accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| or should it all come back to the insurance committee we're supposed to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| and then send the RFP out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9415)|
| 2:37:02| Sir, may I make a comment to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| I would suggest that the insurance committee did not have within its scope to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:15| We already have disease management services within our self-funded insurance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9435)|
| 2:37:22| This is merely a different delivery method for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| I would suggest that if you will go back and look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| that the scope of the insurance committee was to select a vendor for our self-funded program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9448)|
