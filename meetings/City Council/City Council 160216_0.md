| 0:01:57| Those items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| So for my report, I want to start by reminding everyone that early voting has started for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| the primaries for Knox County offices, as well as the presidential race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Early voting will continue through next Tuesday, February 23rd, and then the primary election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| is Tuesday, March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| I know that a lot of the tension is on the presidential race, but we have some very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| county races that are also on the ballot, County Commission, School Board, Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| and Property Assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| So we encourage everybody to go out and to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| And you can find all the voting information, including the early voting locations, at knoxcounty.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| slash election on the Election Commission website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| As council members know, we have been working for a while on the redesign and realignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| of the entrance at Fort Dickerson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| There will be a meeting next week to give an update on that project and to preview the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| improvements that are still to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Those include landscaping, signage, a new transit stop, and a decorative veneer for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| the 30-foot high retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| That meeting will be on Wednesday, February 24th at 5.30 p.m. at Flinnegan Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| That's the Permanent Support of Housing Development on Flinnegan Avenue, 115 Flinnegan Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| The redesigned entrance is going to really showcase Fort Dickerson and make it much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| As you know, it was very hard to get in and out of the former entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| And it's going to be more accessible and attractive for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| There will also be a discussion at the meeting of other future improvements to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| including both the overlook and the quarry area down below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=221)|

| 0:06:50| council, all of us to come together and to focus on neighborhood-based issues like David's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=410)|

| 0:07:03| I've had a chance, there are several people that are here tonight to talk about the Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Avenue streetscape and I look forward to hearing from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| I had a chance to speak with a few of you before the meeting started, but what I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| tell you now, as I told a few of those out in the hall, I want to sit down and meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| folks who are concerned about Magnolia Avenue streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| I'll come to you, you can come to me, I'll be glad to talk about it more after the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| and figure out exactly how we want to proceed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| But I want to hear your ideas about how we can, you know, revitalize and invest in Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=452)|
| 0:07:41| Avenue corridor and the adjacent neighborhoods in a way that serves the community best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| That's been our intention all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| And I've had a number of people ask me, you know, how did this get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| What's the background on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| And I want to give some historical context to it, as I know it, having been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| with city government since end of 2006, early 2007, when I was the community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| And at that time, and a lot of several, I guess most of the council members were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| around at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| So just a little bit of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| When at that time, in 2009 is when the original Magnolia Corridor plan was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| And prior to that, and I see people out in the audience, so I know we're involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| that different meetings along the way, but that was during the time when we had significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| federal dollars with the empowerment zone, through the empowerment zone, plus city dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| that were being invested throughout our urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| And really the empowerment zone was carried out throughout most of the 2000s, starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| at the end of around 1999 and then to about 2010, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| So all of that time in the first decade of the 2000s, the empowerment zone was in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| and we were investing, and there were a lot of community meetings, and we invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| a number of different projects throughout the empowerment zone, including things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| a career center at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| You know, Pellissippi had opened in the old Catholic high school, and there was a career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| center where people could go in and develop their resumes and get training on how to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| jobs and get support like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| There was the redevelopment at Five Points, which turned into the Village Plaza, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| was a neighborhood commercial development and a store there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| It didn't survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| There was a rebuilding of what is now the Paul Hogue Park, and KCDC started working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| on making improvements to Walter P. Taylor Homes and the senior complex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| There was an empowerment zone small business loan program, and that was managed by one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| organization, and then it was transferred to the Urban League to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| And so small businesses were getting loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| There were tax incentives that the federal government gave to businesses who hired employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| So there was a lot of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| We had a very active blighted property program to try and turn blighted properties into properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| where people could live and where businesses could flourish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| We had a lot of federal dollars as well as city dollars to put into blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| acquisition and to put into owner-occupied rehab and rental rehab and ways to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| historic properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| So we saw a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Now, a lot was going on, but there are a lot of challenges that continue, and they continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| on to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| So a lot of that work, even though the empowerment zone went away, and as federal dollars have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| gone down, we've actually increased the city dollars that we spend on all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| City dollars go into blighted property acquisition and to a lot of these improvements that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| talk about at every one of our council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| So in that context, in around 2009, the AIA, the Architects Association here, was celebrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=646)|
| 0:10:57| an anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| I can't remember what it was, 50 years, 100 years, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| I think it was 50, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| 50 years anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| They wanted to reach out and do something with the community for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| They went to MPC, and MPC had had requests from Magnolia Avenue Merchants, and in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| face of all this other stuff we had been doing, there were requests to focus on Magnolia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| you know, from downtown all the way out to Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| What can we do to improve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| The city was working on the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| That plan really came out in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| Cumberland Avenue plan was being worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| The Broadway and Central Avenue, Downtown North, those plans were going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| So we were focusing on north, west, and south, near west, and so folks said, what about east?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| So there was a demand from the community that we heard that wanted us to look at Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| Avenue corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| I have to tell you, I was a little nervous because there were no dollars in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| budget, and I was the Director of Community Development because we were starting to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| the other stuff in line, and one of my concerns was if you do a plan and then you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| money to implement it, people are going to be pretty disappointed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| And so we went in there, though, because we had support and people wanted to work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| then MPC and the AIA and the Magnolia Avenue Merchants and different groups started working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| on it, and community development staff were at the meetings as well, and I think Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| There was a lot of public meetings, and I looked at the report, people from like 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| people to 100 people would come to those meetings, I remember being at several of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| and the result is the Magnolia Corridor Plan, which it's online, you know, you can look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| at it, and that plan was vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| It went to MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| It was unanimously adopted by MPC, and I know at least one member of MPC is in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| today who voted on that and supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| It went to City Council then, and it had two readings, and the representative for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| Magnolia Avenue District, Bob Booker, who many of you know, a great historian, a first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| director of the Beck Center and a state legislator, he made the motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=790)|
| 0:13:18| Chris Woodhall from Tribe One, who had an office on Magnolia Avenue, he voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| There was actually one member of City Council that did not support it, and that was Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| Hall, Steve Hall from Northwest Knobsville, who chose not to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| It came back for a second reading, and the same people voted for it, and the one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| There was no public opposition at the time when that was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| So that plan was accepted by Council, and then it started getting into the queue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| then get funding, to start getting funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| So I think it was in 2013, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| When I put in the budget to start the process of implementing a part of that, which is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| streetscapes part of it, you know, Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| So meanwhile, let me tell you, when that plan was adopted as community development director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| we didn't want it just to sit on the shelf and have, you know, nothing occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| So we started targeting our facade dollars that we had in community development to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| of the key intersections along Magnolia, you know, entrances and, you know, some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| the key areas so we could start having some impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| The city put some money into Chilhowee Park, we've, you know, solved the flooding problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| at Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| We've tried to, you know, just the other, just recently we put some money into the renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| of the Urban League building, so the recreation center's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| So we've tried to, we've continued to invest in East Knoxville throughout this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| But we finally were at a point where we could put money into the Magnolia Avenue streetscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| Meanwhile, there was a Magnolia Avenue Warehouse District that was formed, a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| There are people from the community that have been meeting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| We put half a million dollars into facade grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| Those have been implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| So things had started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| One of our philosophies is that you have strength when you redevelop from the inside out, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| So a lot of redevelopment had occurred downtown, and then we started working on the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| corridors that extend from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| This is our philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| So even though we've done investments all along Magnolia, the streetscape plan would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| start from downtown and start heading out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| And it's a long road and it costs a lot of money, but we've got to start somewhere, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| you start with the first, you know, four to six blocks, depending on how you count it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| and then you do that and then you move out from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| And that's been, that's our commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| That's my commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| So we started this in all good faith, started working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| I've had some community meetings throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| And I can remember being at a meeting, I guess it was a year ago, when we first had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| of the concepts come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| And there was a lot of people that attended, gave us some good feedback that the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| came back and our designers came back and incorporated some of that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| So then at the last meeting of the streetscape plan, that's when a lot of folks came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| to express opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| And I'm sorry I wasn't there, because I could have given some more perspective and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| have told you all of this at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| So I apologize for not being there at that public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| But I tell you this to say that we have entered this in all good faith, along with efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=993)|
| 0:16:41| at, continue to support employment opportunities, entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| By the way, the loan program that the Urban League was running for us, it was city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1007)|
| 0:16:57| You know, as people pay back their business loans, we make more loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| The dollars were technically the city's dollars, but the Urban League wanted to up their game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| and become a community development financial institution, CDFI, so they could make even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| so they could access more dollars to create loans for businesses that they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1033)|
| 0:17:22| And so they tried to get a CDFI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| They failed because they didn't own the Empowerment Zone portfolio, it was ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| So they came back and said, will you grant us your Empowerment Zone portfolio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| I don't know, it was a couple million dollars, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| So this council, I think it was some of the same council members, voted to grant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Empowerment Zone small business loan portfolio to the Urban League so they could then leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| that to become a CDFI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| And so there are a number of things like that that we continue to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| I see Stan Johnson out there with SEED, they're working with us on the KEEM, on the Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| Efficiency Makeover Program, a thousand people will benefit from those dollars that we helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| pull down from TVA, CAC is implementing, and a lot of small businesses, they're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| to get a lot of small businesses to implement and do these energy efficiency makeovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| So there are a lot of things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| So I want to share those with the folks that are concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| I understand the issues that you are raising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| As a planner and somebody, I actually studied gentrification in planning school, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| one of the things that I was concerned about when I was in planning school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| I understand the risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| And so I want to meet with you, I was actually on a conference call just the other day with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Smart Growth America, because I'm on their advisory board, and one of the things they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| mentioned was that they were doing some specific research about how do you revitalize without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| I said, that's exactly what I need to talk to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| And so we'll be following up with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| So what I'm asking, and we want to hear you tonight, but what I ask you to do is commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| to meeting with me, to exploring this more, learn what we are doing, let's talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| what else we need to do, learn what we're doing and learn what our partners in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| And how can we work together so that the investment that is made on Magnolia, a streetscape, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1157)|
| 0:19:26| infrastructure development, which by the way, we're doing it all over town, East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| should get it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| But we need to do it in a way that serves the community and that the community benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| That is our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| So I want to meet with you, we want to continue to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| There actually are a number of people that have contacted us, organizations, individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| who are afraid that East Knoxville is going to lose this investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| I'm telling them, you're not going to lose it, but we're going to make sure that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| it in a way that people understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, and that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| addressing concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| So I know that took a long time, Council, I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| But I want you all to know not only where our heart is, but where our plans are as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| as we address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| So we'll move on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| When we get to the public forum, then I would be glad to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| I think Council has established rules, but I understand last time they agreed to suspend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| those rules so everybody could be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Without objection, I'm going to expect that we'll do the same tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| And then hopefully after the meeting, some of us can get together and then make plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| to then meet, you know, in the future to talk about this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| So I'm going to end my monologue here and move on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| But I wanted to share that with all of you before I moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Councilman Dellivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Yeah, if you're moving on to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| I just wanted to say that I can recall as a member of Town Hall East, a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| group in East Knoxville, further out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| We were engaged way back when we were at the Jacobs Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| The architects came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| They had a series of sketches and designs and road segments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| They broke us up into groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| We had meetings about what would you want to see there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| What's wrong with what's on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| And there has been a long-term effort to try to figure out what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| I mean, there was a lot of talk about Burlington, how do you revitalize it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| There was even talk by the architects about a circle that might be built where Rutledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| Pike joins Asheville Highway to make that more integrated in terms of traffic, so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| traffic can move easily into Burlington and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| But there's been a long-standing effort to try to analyze where we go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| And I appreciate that you brought up some of those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| And actually, when you mentioned Burlington, we actually had several facade projects right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| there in the Burlington commercial area as an attempt to help revitalize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| But the timing and just the circumstances, the economy at the time, some of them were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| improved, but they haven't taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| And I know Mayor Brown has mentioned that several times to me about how can we help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| invigorate Burlington in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| And thank you for the history in terms of what has happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| I also just want to say I've gotten several emails after our last meeting, and just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| to reiterate that public forum is a time for the citizens to report to us, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| not a time to debate or talk back and forth in terms of the way the rules are set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| But several people had emailed me and asked why we did not respond at that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| And yeah, we don't typically respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| That's another thing to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| We don't typically respond to everything, but that's why I want to have the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| later, anybody that wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| So public forum is an opportunity to express your views, whatever they might be on whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| topic, but then it's not to engage back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| But we will have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I will have that engagement with you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| And then the other thing I wanted to mention to council and also to the citizens, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| we lost a pillar last night in Jim Wakefield, who was a member of MPC, and he did resign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| but Jim passed away last night after six months of a quick illness with cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| And Jim, it's a little difficult for me because Jim was a personal friend, but he was a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| pillar in the community and also as far as construction goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| And Jim was the type of guy, and I think George, you knew him, I don't think Jim knew a stranger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| and he worked very hard at giving back to the community and especially giving back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| his construction industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| And so I would just like to mention that council sends our condolences to his family for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| And it's Jim Wakefield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| So thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Yes, are you, are we now on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| We're on council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| I wanted to bring up that we are now in African American History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| This is the month of February, and that was founded in 1915 by Dr. Carter G. Woodson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| And so we're in the 101st year of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| It used to be Negro History Week, but in the 70s it was changed to Black History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| And so I'm encouraging all of our citizens, both black and white and whatever race, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| come out and participate in the many activities that are planned this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| We're already in the middle of the month, so some things are already over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| But I would encourage everybody to participate in that the rest of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| We'll move on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1468)|

| 0:31:19| 11B is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation, if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| of a fee simple interest in certain property located at 5620 Sierra Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| parcel ID number 068-EA-006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| believed to be owned by Robert J. Downey Jr. and wife Bernice E. Downey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| at an estimated cost of $55,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| as recommended by the Abandoned, Blighted, and Vacant Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1905)|

| 0:31:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Councilman Dela Vofe, you had a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I didn't know if we had Ms. Wade here or not, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| She is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| If you could, since we have so many extra guests today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| if you'd tell us a little bit about the Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| This is one of several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| but it is one of the opportunities we use to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| house and get it back into use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| and it's something that's very important to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| So if you would just explain the program, I think it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| We have several items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Two are acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| which is the first phase of alleviating blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| And then we have some sales as well through our Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| So in a situation like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| where a property has been blighted for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| neighbors have complained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| there are numerous codes violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| it is taken to the Better Building Board to be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| and then certified blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| and that gives us the ability to acquire this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| We pay fair market value for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| and then once we have it, we can stabilize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| take care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| and list it in our Homemakers Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| so that a responsible owner can buy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| and then rehabilitate it either for sale or for rental or to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| And is there one extra piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| that you actually keep a string on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| so that if it isn't rehabilitated, the city will take it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| And if you would just explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| When we sell a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| there is a reversionary clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| that says that if the new owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| fails to rehabilitate this property within a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| then we have the authority to take it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| and then resell it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| So your program puts this stuff back into active use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| and contributes to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Gets people living in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| gets it well taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| gets it back on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| and helps to stabilize the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2039)|

| 0:36:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Jim Hagerman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Maybe he could just tell us briefly this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| which seems mostly technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| about physical quantities and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| but if you would explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| why we're spending an additional $160,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| it would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Jim Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Director of Engineering for the City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| might note that for Phase 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| which this sums up and cleans up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| we actually came out $100,000 low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| So all of these corrections of quantities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| came out in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| For what we've done so far on Phase 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| most of the changes have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| there was some temporary street lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| there was some conflicts in utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| that had to be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| and there's some adjustments to standards for signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| that when we were first specified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| they were using an old standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| and we're updating them to a new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| a more current street signal standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| So when a company bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| there's a set understanding between the city and them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| as to what they're bidding on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| but if there's more physical quantities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| or changes in design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| you end up negotiating a change to the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| So if there is a change in quantities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| we either get the difference back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| on a per-unit quantity basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| or we have to pay an additional amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| on a per-unit quantity basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| and all of those quantities are specified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| but when we change specifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| as we're doing with the signal equipment...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| They might have more work to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| or more expensive components to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Ann, do you have anything you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| No, Jim, you did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| I'm happy to answer questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2314)|

| 0:39:08| How can you be against Sensible Roofing Solutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Sensible Roofing, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Good name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2352)|

| 0:39:29| 11J is a resolution rescinding Resolution R-171-2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| which authorized the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2376)|

| 0:40:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| I'll go since we haven't heard yet from Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| I'll call on him first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Well, do you, to explain, don't we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| we're rescinding the original action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Who wants to, who's going to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Don Michelle, our Director of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| This is rescinding the pilot that they once established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| They are now applying for a TIP application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| to reuse the OKUB building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| So if this moves forward through Council tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| that pilot will be rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Well, I just want to get clarity on that, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| for those listening and those in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| But I couldn't be any happier to see this come before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| It's one of the last buildings that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| it's been an icon throughout the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| and it's just been sitting empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| And I had hopes for the last, what, two or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| that something could have happened, but it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| But I think for a reason that we've got Tombris Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| that is going to, you know, if we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| take this building and really make it a showpiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| And I think it really goes hand in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| with the investment that we've made along with Regal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Tombris, not quite as flamboyant, if you will, as a Regal or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| but they're certainly a tremendous company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| They have offices all over our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| have international customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| they have customers all throughout the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| And I'm sure those clients come visit us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| and we get to showcase our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| hopefully in about a year or 15 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| however long it's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| But I think this is, and not to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| that it's going to create good-paying jobs, creative jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| and I just couldn't be any happier to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| moving forward this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Do you have any objection to the flamboyant statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| You'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Councilman Dallaropi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Well, I'm going to join in in saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| that I'm happy to see this important corner to be reworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| My reservation at the outset was that this TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| this tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| is going to take 20 years to play out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| and to me it seems like a long time for the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| to wait to get the benefit at least of the property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| But I realize that during the interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| there are sales tax benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| that there's going to be retail in that place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| as well as office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| that it's a very important corner in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| I suggested to Tim Hill that maybe he should eat the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| between 15 years and 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| He didn't seem too eager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| So I'm assuming that the staff has analyzed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| in a way that says this is probably the best approach to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| and Mr. Pavlis is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| that building's been empty for 16 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| and it kept almost being redone, but it never got redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| And we like to see our downtown working and back together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| and I note in the paperwork that there are some 225 to 250 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| that will be employed in that structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| and that's a good thing for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| So again, I wish Dawn Michelle was a little tougher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| and would have squeezed a few more bucks out of Tim's pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| and made this a 15-year tiff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| but I understand this is as good as it gets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| and I'm going to support it, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| We like to squeeze as much as we can as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| My staff will correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| but I believe we immediately get 25 percent of that new increment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| so we don't go the whole time without the increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| We get 25 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| On the front end, the boost of completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| It's a $9.7 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| It's something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Incrementally over time you do get payment on the tiff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| throughout the tiff years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| I appreciate the staff's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| It's stingier than they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| I just support what my colleagues have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| I think it's a fantastic sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| You know, 20 years ago, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| sort of the saying was that downtown was dead after five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| But with residents and restaurants and retail moving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| the office market sort of was soft for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| But I think what we're seeing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| that a lot of businesses are moving back to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| and I think that's really important for our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| that it's a great place to shop and go to theaters and restaurants and live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| but it's also a great place to locate your office or your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| So I think this is a tremendous sign, a great company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| and I hope they do fantastic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2687)|

| 0:46:34| Councilman Daliboky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Yeah, I just wonder if someone here to speak to this, maybe Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| is it does say one unit per acre and it's almost a four-acre tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| but it actually is a memory care facility with 52 rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| and I gather that's a good thing for the community to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| but could you tell us a little bit more about the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2813)|

| 0:46:57| application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2817)|

| 0:47:00| Gerald, excuse me, can I interrupt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2820)|

| 0:47:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| This particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2828)|

| 0:47:14| Go ahead, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| The memory care facility is use permitted on review within the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| being proposed, and at this time the applicant only provides the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| information on the number of units which would be proposed and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| square footage, which is 52, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| 52 units, I think it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| 52 units and 38,000 square feet plus and minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| Again, following the rezoning, the fuller plans would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| submitted for review by MPC staff and the commission itself and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| approval by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| At the time of the application for the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| there's very little information presented regarding the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| But at the use and review, you actually get down into the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| and look at things like lighting and accommodations and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Lighting, landscaping, parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Impact on neighbors and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| So, council, we're now to the public forum, and we have eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Just so everyone knows, by council rules, you have up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| It's my job to set the timer, and I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| I try to let you know when you're a minute from your max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| And so I'll set the timer when each person comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| We are pleased that you are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| The first person to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Mayor, do we need to vote on suspending the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| You're probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Is there a motion to suspend the rules to hear all people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| And we had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| The ayes have it, and the rules are suspended to hear everybody on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| So, again, we start with Coy Kindred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Is Coy Kindred here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Come on up to the podium there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| Thank you for being here, and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| I'm going to set the timer, and I'll let you know when you're about a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Hi, my name is Coy Kindred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| I live at 5711 Green Valley Drive in Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| I'm a resident of East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| and I'm here today to address the Magnolia Avenue corridor of the streetscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| I've been very disappointed at the way the plan continues to be framed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| I keep hearing that there's no opposition, that feedback is being incorporated into the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| and that people understand gentrification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| yet I have yet to see any concrete plans to prove the commitment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| My questions are, what are you doing to maintain affordable housing for current residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| Because we all know that what happens with gentrification efforts such as this is that the property values shoot up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| which is great for some people, but along with that, the rent goes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| and local longstanding businesses and residents are pushed out because they can no longer afford to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| And this has happened in Knoxville before, so this is not a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| We know what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| It's happened in our community, and we're trying to prevent it from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| The supposed public forums have been presentations a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| than they've actually been anything that took into consideration the community's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| We want to be more than just a checkmark on a list that deceptively misrepresents our support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| because that is what has been happening so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| I suggest a forum that's put on by the people, where we can express our concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| discuss alternatives, and feel empowered to reclaim our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| I'm also very concerned about the loss of culture, black culture specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| and the lack of consideration for preserving the arts and culture in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| As an artist and a poet myself, it has been heartbreaking to hear the stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| of different artists in the community that have been trying to get access to grants and funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| to build up culture in East Knoxville and have been pushed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| I personally feel like voting needs to be suspended until a real discussion happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| that actually considers the voice of the community, the whole community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| and not just a very few that continue to be at the table for these discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| that leaves out the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| So I look very forward to having that meeting with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| and for the people to be able to put on a presentation from our point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| and I expect that all of you will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| Next is Rhonda Gallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3117)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you for being here, and I'll start your timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| My name is Rhonda Gallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| I live at 2431 White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| I am from East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| I was here at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| I'm going to actually say basically the same thing I said last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| but quickly, of course, I'd like to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| How many people in our audience support the businesses downtown Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| and at Westtown Mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| Nobody wants to raise their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| No one supports businesses there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| No one wants to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Everyone, even up on the panel, do you all support any of those businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| How many of you all support any of the black businesses in the inner city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Do you do it frequently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| It's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Now, the reason that I ask those questions is because we were talking about the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| Also, with the empowerment funding and all, we have a problem in our inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| with people coming to spend their monies in the area, and sometimes, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| as I had said before, the media works against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| As you had stated before, that you would be willing to meet with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| which I'm very pleased to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| Also, I would like to extend it even further to ask that you would actually come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| and take a tour with some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| You can take it with me in our city so I can talk to you personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| and point out the things because I am a product of the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| instead of having people that are not from our city or do not continue to dwell in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| to talk about our inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| So that is a request that I would like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| How much time do I have left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| I'm going to do this as quick as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| You missed it last week, but I'm going to bring it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Come on, Rhonda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| First, I'm going to present to you my poster, the same poster from last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| Everybody sees my poster, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| There's nothing on this poster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Let me let you guys see it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| There's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Now, I'm going to flip it over, and here's my box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Now, this is where I need everyone to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| I would like for you to put yourself in this box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Imagine yourself in this box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| This is the empty box product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| This is an empty box that I place you in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| and this box does not have a window for you to look out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| or a door for you to exit or enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| It has no centers, no parks or recreations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| It has no jobs, no money, no entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| There are no resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| There's no book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| There's no culture, and there's no religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| And if you have to spend a lot of time in this box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| you're going to be left with five phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| I'm trying to get it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| My hand's kind of messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| There's five phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| One is the emotional phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| You're going to scream and cry and shout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| but no one's going to be there to hear you cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Nobody's going to be there to hear you scream and shout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| No one's going to be there to wipe those tears from your eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Secondly, you're going to reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| You're going to question yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| and you're going to ask, how did I get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Who am I, and where did I come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Third, you're going to be exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| You're going to be tired and weak from crying, screaming, and shouting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| and questioning yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Fourth, you're going to become depressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| You're going to be unhappy and sad, and you're going to feel hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| So after you do those four phases over and over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| you're going to come to realize that you are fully aware that something is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| So in this box, what you're going to be left with is four elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| and here they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| There's hope, dreams, mind, and body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Your hopes will be murdered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Your dream will turn into a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| You will lose your mind, and your body will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| And again, some people look at this box as an empty room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| Some people look at it as a jail cell, and some look at it as a coffin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| and I'm sure no one wants to spend the rest of their life in a coffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| So my challenge to you is, in conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| I would like to request an order of protection against the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| to protect and save our culture, our community, and our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you very much, and I look forward to seeing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3404)|
| 0:56:52| Now Xavier Jenkins, Mr. Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3412)|
| 0:57:02| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3422)|
| 0:57:12| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Xavier Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| I live at 125 North Crew Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Okay, last time we convened, basically I gave a story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| and it was a story about the British in Zulu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| It was a story of basically the British, you know, coming and asking for land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| and I asked a simple question, and it kind of related to that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Are we going to live as one Knoxville, black, white, black, white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| or are we going to live as two Knoxvilles, East Knoxville and West Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3468)|
| 0:57:57| Since that meeting, some things transpired, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| Sister Rhonda, after that meeting, she was actually followed home by a KPD officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| okay, all the way to Green Hills Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| The day after, I believe, or two or three days afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| I had the actual gang task force posted outside of my apartment, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| My girlfriend begged me not to go out, but knowing me, I rose to the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| I went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| When I went out, they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| These were members of all clearly wearing police vests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| They were, I think, traveling in one KPD-marked car, Cadillacs, sports cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| cars that I apparently can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| My fiancée, she was actually followed home, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| The reason I bring these things up is if we are to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| those tactics stop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| I wanted to get that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Our concerns are simple, lack of investment in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| which the mayor has addressed, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| What we would ask is that those investments directly go to black businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| black construction businesses need to be involved, black laborers, black workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| We have enough problems with lack of opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| and I think that would address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Lack of infrastructure, lack of parks, lack of parks and recreation, lack of streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3579)|
| 0:59:47| As far as street bettering of our streets, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| I mean, I can't tell you how many potholes we drive on in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| whereas West Knoxville has the, you know, yellow brick roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| Lack of community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| We want our community to be directly involved in this project, not just a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| And even though I, Rhonda, and, you know, Rachel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| and some of these other people are speaking on the community's behalf, we're not the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| There are a lot of voices that need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| And basically, again, what we're asking is that you cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| Let's rethink it and rethink how we should move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Moving forward, I ask that you address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| The mayor, she's talked with us, a few of us have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| We are more than welcome to have that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| We welcome it and do so with a respectful manner where we listen to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| However, we need real change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| We don't want the whole, you know, none of the, how can I say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| none of the kowtowing and, you know, just selling us hopes and dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| That doesn't fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| It doesn't fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| We're very aware of what's going on and we want actual change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| At this time, I'm going to quit speaking because I think there's some other people that would like to get up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| and I definitely want to hear Edward speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| So thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| Amelia Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3694)|
| 1:01:44| Thank you, ma'am, for being here, and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| Hi, my name is Amelia Parker, and my address is 3306 Fairway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| Thank you all for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| Let me get my notes ready tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| It will not just be the same emotional sharing that I did two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| I've got some points to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| My frustration was real a couple of weeks ago, and I think that frustration is coming from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3730)|
| 1:02:20| from Knoxville, went to high school, college here, and then I went to law school in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| came back to Knoxville in 2009, and I saw a lot of improvements in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| But East Knoxville looked the same, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| And, in fact, in speaking with people in the community, because I am a community organizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| so I speak with lots of folks in the community, it was a constant telling of more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| and more services that had been pulled back and were no longer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| Volunteers who were volunteering their time to provide health care services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| because there was nowhere else to go on the east side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Campaigns run by all races of people trying to get healthy food into East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| because residents have been saying over and over and over again what their basic needs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| and those basic needs continue by this city not to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| So I want to speak directly to you all about what my expectations are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3802)|
| 1:03:30| This is not just in terms of the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| but this is how the city of Knoxville governs moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| This is what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| No longer are we looking to sell off our communities to the highest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| What we are looking for from our elected officials is when you look to put a project in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| as you're thinking about the budget coming up next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| the first thing that comes to mind must be our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| I don't care what taxes came in last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| I don't care which ones you expect to come in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| First, start with our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| What do we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Begin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| When we look at Magnolia, when we talk about infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| are trees the first thing that come to your mind when you think of that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| when you think about the basic needs that need to be met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| Do you think once you beautify that community, folks who have been undereducated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| underemployed for decades will be able to just, you know, set up shop and start a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3870)|
| 1:04:39| Have you heard from community members who've tried,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| who've run programs in the community for decades and have come to this city for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| and haven't been able to find that funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| Have you talked to them about what are the barriers for them for getting funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| It's time for this city to prioritize the people and the needs versus profit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3898)|
| 1:05:06| I don't, you know, I don't care if we need to raise the budget $10 million next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| to give this community what it needs, but that's where we have to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| And that's the conversation that we want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| Although I didn't even actually go to my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| Let me go to my points real quick before I run out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| Okay, so what am I talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| What am I, what kind of vision am I drawing for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| Because I know this is not how you normally operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| What we're asking for is you to completely change the way that you operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| And you may be one of the few city councils that would operate this way throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| But we've got to start local and then on a statewide level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| and then on a federal level to make the changes we need to see in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| so that we don't have a continuing growth in economic disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| So that we don't continue to build new schools in communities that are outside of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3961)|
| 1:06:09| where folks have gone decades without adequate schooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| I know that that's not within the city council's budget, but this is the overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| if we need to merge the city and county back together to get this done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| we're going to have to do what we've got to do to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Because it's not just about a bottom line, how much money do we have available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| but it's simply what are the needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| Let's start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| If we can start there, we can create not only a redevelopment process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| that helps East Knoxville current residents, new residents who come, whoever, to flourish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| If we start with the needs of the community and approach this in a human rights way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| valuing the human rights of all, we're not only supporting those basic needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| investing in those basic needs, but we're respecting the culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| I have not seen black culture respected in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| It's time that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| Next is Edward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Edward, tell me how you pronounce your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| It's your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| Thank you for being here, Edward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| And pull that microphone down towards you, please, so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4056)|
| 1:07:44| Sorry, but I like Twix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| Edward Shiawa, 211 Ebill Street, zip code 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Let's just see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| I'll just hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| I'm here for the Magnolia Gentrification Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| Magnolia is not only important to me, but it's important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4089)|
| 1:08:17| We have to take into account how this affects people who have always lived here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4097)|
| 1:08:26| Gentrification has been negatively affecting black people nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| and many of us here hold the same fear that take into account how schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4113)|
| 1:08:44| and local businesses could be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| Investing in the people here, including schools and communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4128)|
| 1:08:57| is important to make sure that all of our voices are accounted for in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4137)|
| 1:09:05| and is important to me for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| And Magnolia is important to me for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| Let's all sit down to talk before anything happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| I have two questions, a question and a rhetorical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4161)|
| 1:09:29| How many people here support the Magnolia thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| Magnolia thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| The corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| The corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| How many people are against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| Okay, that's good, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| And another thing is how much money do you plan on spending on Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4196)|
| 1:10:03| if you do go on with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| $17 million was spent for the Cumberland streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4205)|
| 1:10:14| So even if you do go with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| we should at least be respected with as much money as you use for Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| If you go through with this, hey, I didn't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| Y'all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Okay, that's going to be on y'all's conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| because this is about our black communities, our black culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| our black religion, and because the quote of Malcolm X,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| Thank you, Edward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| Next is Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4256)|
| 1:11:08| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| and thank you for being here, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| My name is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I'm 241 Hawthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| And I was just going to write up a little speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| or something dramatic to say to all you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| And then I was listening to what the mayor was saying, and I decided, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Let's talk about some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Let's talk about the empowerment zone and the facade money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| that really overlooked the black community in lots of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| Let's not pretend like this money went into our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| and we had control over how it looked like in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| Let's talk about the redevelopment at five points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| Where is it at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| The little spot that you are so proud of that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| this little strip mall right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| how is that benefiting people right now who live around that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| Let's talk about the small business loans that you say is so prevalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| and going out to our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Let's talk about how I know so many people with so many good ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| about how to start a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| and how to have different things going on in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| that they think would benefit not only them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| but the community and neighborhoods and their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| and they don't have the resources to actually go with those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| Let's talk about Tribe One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| You mentioned Tribe One and how Tribe One is no longer here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| and you all have the opportunity to actually fund stuff like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| Let's talk about how I hear so many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| like I go to all these community meetings and hear all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| with these good ideas about how to step up in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| I have a friend who actually has a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| where she takes some youth just around her neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| She brings them in, and they get involved in a program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| and then their lives are a lot of times changed afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| but she doesn't have the resources to keep feeding folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| to keep renting vans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| to keep doing all these things she wants to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| because she doesn't have the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| Let's talk about how, what was it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| $12 million went to Regal Cinema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| You all know about Regal Cinema?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| You all know about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| $12 million went to this business to move across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| We can talk about South Knoxville and how that area is being gentrified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| That's $12 million, millions of dollars in tax breaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| and all this over the years that they're going to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| and how Black Knoxville consistently over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| is getting the scraps, getting the scraps of the city's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| Don't talk about Save Our Sons as if that's enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| and don't talk about Save Our Sons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| like people don't walk into your office, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| and say, hey, we have an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| or have an idea on how we can actually reach young folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| There's young folks actually who just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| there's a young man who actually just got out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| and came to your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| He's like, yo, I have ideas about how to reach these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| because either those people you're talking about trying to reach are me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| and how you just turn them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| Let's talk about how you're not actually funding people from this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| to actually take control of their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| and actually invest in the community we want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| So, yes, I am in opposition to this redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| Yes, I am in opposition to this plan that's made in the back rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Yes, I'm in opposition to this plan that you say has all this community support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| but then I look out here and I have conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| with people around the neighborhoods, and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| well, what about grocery stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| What about pharmacies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| What about fixing our roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| What about building schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| What about all these things that actually help us out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| And what are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Okay, so let's actually, I'm going to turn to the audience on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| Now, let's say that the streetscape plan is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| Mr. Hayes, Mr. Hayes, you're supposed to be addressing city council during public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Okay, so let's say –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Okay, so audience, audience, everybody behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| let's say the streetscape plan goes as planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| and they give a whole new facelift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| When they say facelift, the cover of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| the picture of what it looked like, it had all white people riding bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| It didn't have any people –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| it didn't have any of the people who currently live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| It didn't look like any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| It didn't look like black folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| It had white people riding bikes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Yeah, walking dogs, all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Oh, they had one black person in the picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| but he was wearing a coat and jeans, obviously just like Photoshopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| It was weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| All right, so let's say this plan goes and proceeds, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| and black people aren't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| and black business owners aren't being made a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| so they don't have access to these new jobs, right, to these new businesses, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| And we see this area become so beautiful, but we see the prices skyrocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| You have one minute, Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| And we see people not even being able to afford the homes that they own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| that they rent, actually, the people who rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| They see they can't even afford the new rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| They see that this business that they had in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| they can't afford the rent to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| so they get pushed out in this place further east, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| Let's talk about the warehouse district in Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Let's talk about how black people were pushed out from there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| You know, so when we talk about bridging downtown outward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| they're not saying let's move downtown outward and bring black folks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| They're saying let's move downtown outward and move black folks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| Next is Rachel Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| Ray Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you, Ms. Jones, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| My name is Ray Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| My address is 2216 Adair Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| So I'm here tonight to speak about the streetscape project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| like many of the other folks in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| And as a queer, white, young person with artistic tendencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| I'm usually someone who's thought of as a harbinger of gentrification, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| I represent the people who might benefit from such projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| But I actually believe the opposite to be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| and I wanted to be here and speak to you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| to represent many of us in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| who do not feel that this is what would be beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| for white folks that live in the neighborhood either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| And while I appreciate your efforts to improve pedestrian safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| maybe increase transportation opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| eliminate food deserts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| or even beautify natural areas along Magnolia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| the top priority should be to listen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| and prioritize the concerns and needs of current residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| and business owners, as we've heard so many times tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| The stated priority of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| when I was doing some research about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| was to make the community more attractive to investors and entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| And that's not going to benefit the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| neither will it benefit me or other white folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| who live close to the area that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| I've lived in a lot of different cities in my adult life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| I lived in Pittsburgh, Boston, Oakland, California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| and I've seen the way that grassy medians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| out-of-state box store businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| corporate private investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| and other quote-unquote improvement projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| have changed neighborhoods for the worst time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| They've destroyed the ability for current residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| and businesses to thrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| or even to continue to live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| And I've learned that there's a history of this in Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| Displacement of people from their homes or businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| is a horrible fate, and certainly not one that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| would knowingly want to inflict on its residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| And I hear that you've studied gentrification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| so you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| And I hope that you can use that knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| and the concerns of the people from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| who are speaking tonight and over the past few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| and way before that, since 2008 is what I've learned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| in order to make sure that that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4721)|
| 1:18:48| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| I don't like speaking in front of people, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| You're doing fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| So I'm deeply concerned at the lack of commitment from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| to listen to current residents of East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| and to center my neighbor's needs and wants in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| This project should be about supporting a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| that has truly been struggling and could use support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| However, the city needs to engage residents and business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| to ask what folks want and need to make the East Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| more successful and to listen to these priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| and then incorporate them into a plan, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| that uses just as much money as you've spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| on the Cumberland Avenue project, like Edward said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| In looking over the Magnolia streetscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| one of the planning principles listed is encourage community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| And again and again, the descriptions of this principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| is paired with pictures of majority white folks at meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| or looking at displays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| David talked about the sketch of the potential project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| which shows a sunny day where only white folks are riding their bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| and eating at outside cafes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| And we know that this is not representative of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| that currently lives there, and that's why we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| If you understood gentrification, then you would understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| and create a proposal that incorporated the current community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| I'm wondering where in this plan are the people...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| I'm wondering where in this plan are the people who currently live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| in the neighborhood surrounding Magnolia Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| and are my neighbors considered in the vision of this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| I certainly hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| I know a lot of current residents and business owners express concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| with this plan and skepticism that the city isn't trying to gentrify this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| Their concerns are valid, and I sincerely hope they are not washed over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| I urge the city to take a progressive and proactive stance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| to ensure the well-being of the area's current residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| and business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| There are many models of community-based decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| and participatory research that could really empower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| East Knoxvillians along the Magnolia Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| to have ownership of the future of their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| I think the mayor's offer of a meeting could be a good start to this end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| It would be beautiful for a city like Knoxville to lead by example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| and demonstrate how a community can learn from its mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| and take steps to grow together in shared power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| As a white person who rides my bike and even enjoys sometimes eating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| outside at cafes, I do not support this plan to erase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| the current neighborhood and build a new one on top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| erasing the historical nature of this community and, more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| displacing and empowering the residents of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| And our last person to sign up is Rachel Wonyoki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| I know you told me how to pronounce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Did I say it right or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| I get mispronounced all the time, too, but tell me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| Hello, my name is Rachel Wonyoki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| So five minutes, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| Name, Rachel Wonyoki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Address, 1605 Branson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| I'm so angry right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| I was really composed last time, and I had this script, and I was contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4936)|
| 1:22:24| Some of my comrades were much more, their speech was a little more emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| But now I'm really, really angry because I don't understand what the point of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| I don't want to hear what's been going on since 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Do you know where I was in 2009?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| I was living in North Knoxville, and then I moved to Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| And in 2011, I was illegally evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| I'm going to repeat that in case that wasn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| You can smile, I don't think it's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| I was illegally evicted in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| 2011, I decided to leave of my own accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| I then went to court and won in front of Judge Long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| which is pretty impossible when you're representing yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| And that began a long battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| I just two weekends ago moved into safe, affordable, viable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| That is five years that I spent wandering this fucking city looking for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=4999)|
| 1:23:27| Yeah, I cursed, because this is my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| This is my life, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| This is a spreadsheet to y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| This is my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| 2013, when there were public forums, I was working at Tribe One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| Where were you all when Tribe One closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| I really want to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| I don't give a damn that Chris Woodhull supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| I want to know where Chris Woodhull was when Tribe One closed, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| So stop throwing out all these things that you've done for my city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| I know what happens when real estate prices go through the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| and disingenuous and illegal property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| when I say illegal, I mean they don't care about the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| They will do things to get you out to raise the rent on the next people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| They're called slumlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| I know maybe none of you up there have had that experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| but many of us in the audience have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| Now, we talk about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| We talk about investing in infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Let's just be really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| The people in the audience here, we feel that the infrastructure are the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| places such as libraries and schools, hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| The city and the governor, as in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| you all seem to think that profits are what matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| I don't think profits matter over people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I don't have this beautiful vision of downtown expanding outward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| like an amoeba, like this big blob that's just, you know, it's like the blob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| It's like the movie from the 60s, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| It's just like swallowing all these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| and you guys are happy because you got some condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| Do you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| You're happy because you've got some condos and some big box stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| I mean, your own words for this development plan, redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| is a facelift to attract outside investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| I'm just repeating your words back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| These are the words I heard at the John T. O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| Okay? That disgusts me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| This city is not just supposed to be hotels and condos and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| because you know what happens when that happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| You get someone who gets murdered due to gang violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160216?start=5139)|
