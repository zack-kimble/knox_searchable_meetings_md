| 0:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| We now have a swearing-in of individuals who wish to testify before the Knox County Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| We have one applicant, and I'm just looking in the audience, and I'm not seeing anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| I believe it was Mahesh Patel from 10919 Hunter's Knoll Lane in 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=134)|
| 0:02:23| Is Mr. Patel present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| I'm going to count to ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| Can we move it to the bottom of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=159)|
| 0:02:55| four, three, two, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| It appears as if the applicant is not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| So we'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Clerks, would you all send a â€“ what is our procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| Are we going to send them a letter that they did not appear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| And so I'm looking back in the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| I think we'll need a motion to defer until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| That way they don't have to start the process back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| So I'll make a motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| We have a motion for a deferral from Commissioner Anders with a second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| Before that, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| In the spirit of Christmas, should we give five minutes in case somebody is hung up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| I mean, we have no place to be until five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| That's quite fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| In that five minutes, I'd like to encourage for discussion of Commissioner Jay's outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| I think Mr. Jay could take that sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| I think you stole his pants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| As I said previously â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Will we answer to Commissioner Christmas tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| I have â€“ I've had these pants for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Do you remember who gave you that name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=246)|

| 0:04:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| You?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Or Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| I couldn't remember the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I can't even fit in a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| I hope you've washed those pants in the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Jerry, he hoped you washed those pants in the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| Mr. Chairman, I've got to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Seeing those pants, was this supposed to be pajama day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| If you're PJs, whatever makes you float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| I've got four pairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| These are my oldest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| And I will be â€“ if you track me, not that you're stalking me, but Commissioner Bustler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| but I will be wearing a different obnoxious pair of pants every day this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Did you also dress yourself today, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| And for the record, for most of the last 20 years, I've always worked with women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| And there have been times in my previous employer where the ladies in our office have been known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| to call my wife with the question of, quote, did you let him leave like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| It has happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| And she said, I choose my battles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| She said, no, I didn't want to see me leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=311)|
| 0:05:20| Well, we could have the law director recite the beer ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:33| Hey, Emma Grace, you can hand out your candy canes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| That actually would be a good use of our time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| Have you handed it to the team up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| I'm glad she missed you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| Start from here and go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| I don't know why you did that on the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| I don't know either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| I did get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| I've got it in my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=363)|

| 0:06:40| Hey, Emma Grace, you know Miss Deborah out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=400)|

| 0:07:24| So see, we had a motion before us with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| The motion was made by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| And the second was, was that Commissioner Busler or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| So that motion is properly before us to send this forward to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| So it will be postponed to be heard at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| In the county clerk's office, y'all will send a proper correspondence to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| OK, is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=467)|

| 0:07:56| Seeing no additional business, is there a motion for adjournment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| All right, we have a motion for adjournment from Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=484)|

| 0:09:18| You're hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Team members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Okay, and may the record reflect that the Commissioner to my right, the Vice Chair, was referred to as, was it Mamal Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| Nanal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Nanal, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| To open the meeting at this special time of the year, I'll call on Commissioner Richie Beeler for the devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| Certainly with no exclusion or disrespect to members of the audience, I really want to address my remarks to my colleagues on the platform, as well as some of the elected officials that we do have in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:57| The Apostle Paul writes in the book of Galatians about the phenomenon, the issue of doing what we do and making the decisions we make in order to gain the approval of man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:12| And I thought about that and how interesting that is because in the world that we're in, in the political process, so much of what we do has to do with seeking the approval of man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=612)|
| 0:10:24| In order to sit in the seats we sit in, oftentimes we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| We have to seek the approval of man on large scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| And it applies to each one of us in a little bit different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| A couple of my colleagues to my left have to seek the approval of many thousands of people when they run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| For the rest of us, we have to seek the approval of several thousand in order to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| But even with that, our situations are still different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Some of us don't necessarily have to seek that approval for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Others of us will have to seek that approval very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Some of us don't have anyone vying against us for that approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Others of us have chosen to either seek that approval elsewhere or, in a couple of cases, maybe not seek that approval anymore at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:12| But even with all that, there's really a more fundamental issue, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| I mean, we don't really do what we do for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| We do what we do for a much more fundamental reason than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| We do what we do in order to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| At least that's what we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| It's not really about pleasing men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| It's about doing the right thing and serving with honor, serving with integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| I'm reminded at Christmas of what's written by the prophet Isaiah in chapter 9 of his book where the Lord speaks through him and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:57| When we do what we do from these seats or from whatever seat we may sit in as a public official, it really isn't the approval of men that we're seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=717)|
| 0:12:07| It's the approval of the one upon whose shoulder the government sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| And so I want to encourage my colleagues, during this Christmas season especially, to look very deep into your own heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| And my prayer for myself and for all of us is that we would seek to do what we do for an audience of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| for the audience of the one on whom the government rests, the one who works all things according to the counsel of his own will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=747)|
| 0:12:36| And I want to invite you to pray with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| Father, thank you so much for this season and what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Lord, to us who hold the faith of Jesus in our hearts, this is the season where we are overwhelmed, God, with gratitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:54| We're overwhelmed, Lord, in so many ways that you sent the only begotten Son of God into the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us so that this world might have hope, the hope of eternal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=781)|
| 0:13:11| Father, I pray that as we sit here in these seats, as we make decisions, God, that we will put aside the approval of man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| that we'll put aside a popularity, and that we will do what we do because you have put it in our hearts to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| and that we'll seek to serve with integrity, with honor, and with an audience of one in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| We ask that in Jesus' name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| And tonight's Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Commissioner John Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| Would everyone please rise and face our nation's flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=834)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| A couple of things as we begin to work on tonight's meeting agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| First, I'd like to take just a moment to recognize and thank some of the other elected officials that I see in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| and others in general, one of which I see Super Bob Thomas over in the back right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| Thank you for joining us, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| I believe I saw Sheriff Tom Spangler here just a few moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Sheriff, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| I believe I saw the mayor here earlier, although he may be sitting over here out of my eyesight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| So I believe Mayor Jacobs is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| So thank you for joining us, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Are there any other elected officials that I haven't seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Patty, I just saw you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Patty from our school board, thank you for joining us tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| Any other elected folks that I may have missed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| Well, thank you all for being with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| These comments are also for folks who may be joining us in the audience for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| or who may be tuning in from home for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| The way these meetings work, we had a work session last week where we took the first path through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| We had a lot of discussion and sort of finalized tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| You're going to see at some moments in the agenda, which may not quite make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| where the clerk is going to read through a whole lot of things so that we can vote on them all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| And that is because we discussed those items at last week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| and we put them on the consent agenda tonight so that for some things like paying the bills and similar things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| we can get all those accomplished with one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| whereas some of the other items that require a lot more debate and discussion and intentionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| were not put on the consent agenda and will be discussed and voted on separately tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| If you're looking online or if you've got a printed copy of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| you'll see there's a small star or asterisk that indicates that something's on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| So just a little bit of homework there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| So before we go into setting tonight's agenda, we are going to go through public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| And I've had one, two, three folks have contacted me before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| who expressed an interest in speaking at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| some of which may be related to items that are going to be coming up later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| And I am going to call your name, and you will have the option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| if you'd like to speak on a particular item, when it comes up on tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| The first one that spoke to me before the meeting was Bill Lyons from the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:42| And Bill, if you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you. I'm Bill Lyons, City of Knoxville, 400 Maine, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| deputy to the mayor of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| And I'd like to just take a moment to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| We've been asked to come and clarify something involving the city's interest in remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| or leaving the city county building for city offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| The city has not had any plans, has not investigated any options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| and doesn't have any plans to move our offices from the city county building to any location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| And I know one of the locations in mind is the Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| I've discussed this both with Mayor Rojero and with incoming Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| We know there's a lot of interest in Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| We all have that as well, and we have agreed in discussing with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| with officials at the county administration, that it would be a good idea to pursue a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| of highest and best uses for that area, and we're willing to partner with the county and KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| if that's the appropriate agency, to pursue such a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Just wanted to clarify that. Been requested to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| Okay. All right. Thank you, Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1075)|

| 0:19:41| regarding jails doing more to save lives in the opium epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| I agree. Jails do save lives of addicts, but can do a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| This honorable commission has the power to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1189)|

| 0:20:11| President Donald Trump calls this fentanyl chemical warfare from Communist China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| It's murdering tens of thousands of Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Let's not forget that inmates are people and citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| My uncle was a prisoner on death row for serial killing and mass murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| He got limited medical care for gunshots during arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| He was lucky. Many inmates were tortured to death without trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| He endured a death march on city streets, walking beneath inmates hanging dead from lampposts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| Fifty thousand inmates who did not go on the death march spent life in prison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| and tortured to death in Communist Russia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1243)|

| 0:20:56| She fed the Germans all the food they could eat from her farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| hoping her son would survive as a POW eating rat stew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| My uncle survived the war and got elected to county commission in Monroe County as a Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1263)|

| 0:21:17| The terrorist bomber was on death row here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| This terrorist was arrested for plotting to blow up bridges in Knoxville for the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| That terrorist was a Christian preacher who owned a newspaper, Parsons Brownlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| He was arrested for treason by a Knox County commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1289)|

| 0:21:43| I currently have friends in jail and prison, including Knox County Detention Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| due to their disease of addiction to opiates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| Their crimes include buying one $5 box of Sudafed at Walgreens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| joyriding cars from friends when the voices tell them they will die if they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| and hosting Bible Home Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Some of them I put in jail to save their lives as a last resort to get medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| And to try to keep them safe from drug dealers who overdose them blue and dead, one ER doctor wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| I prosecuted their drug dealers and got trap houses seized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| They also have severe disabilities like traumatic brain injury, epilepsy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| severe mental disorders, suicide attempts, and schizophrenia, which is dementia for young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| They are not being treated for these medical conditions despite prior diagnoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| This puts their survival on release at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| One friend, Stephanie Mendez, went psychotic in jail for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| Her crime was possessing 10 tobacco cigarettes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Her first day out of jail, she was kidnapped and murdered by forced overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| I'm attempting to arrest her killers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| which would be the first conviction of a drug dealer for murder by OD in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| Actually, she survived the overdose in coma at Tristar Skyline Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Breathing with heartbeat, pain response, brain waves normal for sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| They spiked when I visited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Doctors kept her in forced coma on fentanyl IV rather than Narcan antidote for opiate overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| The medical examiner signed her death certificate even though she was still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Two days later, doctors tortured her to death by knives and saws, no pain meds or sedatives allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| only a paralyzing date rape drug like Dexter, until her beating heart was cut out of her chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| Medicare insurance paid her doctors $5 million for her murder by organ harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1399)|

| 0:23:27| like Christians arrested and murdered in communist China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| The drug dealer who kidnapped her is employed by an organ harvest company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Sick inmates require help to transition back to society as productive law-abiding citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| They need to be on SSI with medical insurance, education, housing, and food stamps in place before release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Instead, they're denied medication for psychosis, starved of nutrition, which causes dementia and psychosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| They're stripped naked in straight jackets and restraint chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| and placed in illegal solitary confinement, which causes psychosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Hearing voices telling them to kill themselves, seeing Satan and demons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| seeing heads change bodies when clean and sober for years in lockup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| They need to be in psychiatric hospitals long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Programs currently exist to do this, but inmates are denied services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| instead getting dozens of petty arrests, living years in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| This county needs a mental health court, not just a drug court, for the safety of all its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| Get mental health fixed, and perhaps the drug problem disappears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| I request that commissioners investigate how to create a mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1465)|

| 0:25:50| Yes, sir, I need to pull 17 off consent so I can abstain from the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| I failed to catch that on Monday, so I need to abstain from 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Okay, so 17 will be pulled. Madam Clerk, if you could note that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1559)|

| 0:26:18| We resolved the insurance issue today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| and hope to have finalized contracts distributed to the commission in the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=1580)|

| 0:40:03| Okay, next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| On page 5, item number 18 is consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| County, Tennessee approving appointments to the 2020 Knox County Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| This is resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Okay, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| All right, the good news first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| We do not have to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| So that is some good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| However, we do need to do an individual vote on each one of these that can be done by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| voice vote to work our way through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| So I am pulling up the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| That doesn't include ourselves, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| So actually, that's a good point, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| So that does reduce the number that we do have to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| That is a great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Have you got it right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| All right, thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Can I ask a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Obviously, the first nine commissioners are on there, but on the mayor's appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| aren't those all, do they have to be approved by commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| That's individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| Yeah, the charter says that all nominees have to be voted on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Okay, I guess the quickest way to do this, I could call the name, ask for a first, second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| and then move quickly to a voice vote on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| So the first item, former Commissioner Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| I'm sorry, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Could we explain to the public what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Because I think this is a key vote, as we call the names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| and the purpose of this resolution is so that people can know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| Great point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| For the public, for those of you who may be watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| just a second, I'm going to acknowledge she made a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Forgive me for not sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| What we're voting on right now to the general public and those who this may be your first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| although we've talked about it in this body multiple times over the last couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| is according to our charter, I believe it's every ten years that we have a charter review committee formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| The purpose of that is to take a deep dive, reviewing our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| and making recommendations for changes or additions, subtractions, improvements to the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:33| By the current charter, it dictates who we put on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| The mayor has nine appointments by charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| and then each county commissioner, except for the two at largest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| can recommend someone from their district to serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| By our current charter, we have to vote on each one of them individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| although we do not have to do a roll call vote for them to be approved to this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| which will then start meeting likely in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| Is that clear enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Yes, do you want to go by what the resolution is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| Because it should start out, I think what you're looking at is the mayor's appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| I'm looking at the mayor's appointments first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| If you go click on the resolution, it lists them in order of the way it's supposed to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| Okay. Well, we can go off the resolution. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| We can go by the district first or by the, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Well, good point, John. Thank you. And go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| I think it's also worth pointing out that this body does not make the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| that recommends changes that go on the ballot for the voters to change in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Thank you. All right. Spilled my water. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2620)|

| 0:48:22| So they're now officially on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Mr. Law Director, do we now need to have a vote on the actual resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2906)|

| 0:48:55| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| On page 7, item number 33, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2936)|
| 0:49:11| Tennessee regarding the assurance of not to exceed $20 million general obligation bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| for Knox County, Tennessee, resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Smith with a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| I have a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| We have a light on from Commissioner Skinner-Maker and this is a roll call item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| But go ahead, Commissioner Skinner-Maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Is Mr. Caldwell available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| He sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| Just for everyone's, I guess, educational purposes, this is probably the smallest bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| issue that we've issued in a long, long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| So what would be the approximate cost to issue this between the bond attorneys and everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| involved in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| I'm going to defer to Joe about the cost and how it's worded too is strange because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| actually, it's not new money is the way it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| It's actually a refunding of leases and that he can go over cost and savings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Mr. Anders, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Joe Ayers, Criminal Securities, 918 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| As Mr. Caldwell mentioned, there's two resolutions here, the statutory initial resolution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| the detailed bond resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| And the reason why the initial resolution is required is because we're proposing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| refinance two capital leases that the county did back in 2013 and 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| So technically what the county will be doing, assuming you all approve these resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| and the bonds are successfully sold, is you will be buying the equipment that was purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| under the two leases by prepaying those leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| The reason the issue is small compared to most new money bond issues is that the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| capital leases add up to about $20 million and so we're only issuing enough bonds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| refinance those capital leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Those capital leases have interest rates that range from about 2.2% up to 3.10% and we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:18| we'll be able to refinance those by issuing general obligation bonds with a rate well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| below 2%, closer to about 1.7% all in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| The total cost of issuance should be slightly less than $100,000 and the savings over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| next 10 years should be slightly more than $800,000 and that's net of all the transactional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| I'm happy to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Good question, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3106)|

| 0:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Madam Clerk, we will need to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3112)|

| 0:53:42| Is there any additional questions or discussion on this bond question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3222)|

| 0:54:24| Commissioner Biggs, that's I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| All members present and voted aye, the resolution passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you, Mr. Ayres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| On page eight, this is item number 37, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:49| County, Tennessee requesting the Knox County Mayor to explore the possibility of purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| the Knoxville Center Mall property for the purchase of relocating all departments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| agencies of Knox County government, including Knox County schools and the court systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| to this location, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Can I get a motion for this one, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| I thought that resolution was amended and this is not the same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| I believe it was made a little bit more general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| I mean, don't you agree, Mr. Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| I think this was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| I accept the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:35| It was discussing a study and a possible opportunity zone discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| It wasn't to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3341)|
| 0:56:04| Okay, so I think what we've got here, this carried over as the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:17| Can you all check the notes or the tape on this from the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| I want to make sure we've got this one right because as I recall it, it was basically...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| It was a little bit...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| It was broader than this one is narrow to explore a feasibility study on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| I guess what we could entertain could be a substitute motion on this one to carry over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| I mean, Mr. Law Director, what do you recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| You have to have some kind of motion brought before the floor and it can be within consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| of the content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| If I recall, it had to do with some kind of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| I do remember that from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| I didn't keep any notes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| But the consideration in the workshop was sent on with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| Even if you had an amendment, you still have the resolution before you that you can currently amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| as you did last month and discuss it and maybe you all can figure out what you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| Mr. Chairman, I think I remember exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| We sent it without recommendation in hopes of having a new resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| I don't think we voted on another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| I think we wanted a rewording of this and it's sent without recommendation in hopes of getting a new resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| That's exactly how we ended last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| We can't right now...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| You can take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| We can take this and amend it and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| But as it sits, I won't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Well, what I want to do...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| Have we got a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| I'm going to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| I've got a light on from Commissioner Biggs and Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Go ahead, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| I'd like to make a substitute motion for there to be a study performed to see the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| of Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| The scope of work to be performed by a third party, which will be determined by the commission with an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| The scope of work I'd like for it to include transportation with a bus line input from TDOT for traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:30| an environmental leg, which would obtain air quality and a carbon footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| and the quality of the building, the roof, the AC units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| and also a portion for internet for, I guess you could say, an IT perspective for the existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| And this is a study, so I'd like for everybody to realize that this could be a town center concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| with a public-private partnership as an economic driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| and also entertains the proper zoning and multi-use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| showing its potential that we can use this as a pilot for future use across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| I've been talking about this for about two and a half years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| and I'm glad that this is starting to get some traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| And it could really help us out in all areas of the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| and show us what we could do with the proper zoning that we're getting ready to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Okay, so that's your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| It's not a substitute motion, so that's a motion to amend this motion into that content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| and we've got a second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Okay, now we can have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Okay, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, because this conversation about East Town Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Knoxville Center Mall, obviously one is not for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| and not to be limited to a town hall concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| But I think even as Dr. Bill Lyons spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| that the component of the city that needs to be added to this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| to make sure we cover all aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| So I think the conversation regarding this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| can encompass a conversation with the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| There was a Sunshine meeting today where everyone was invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| We actually met with the owner of Knoxville Center Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| was in from Minneapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| He made it quite clear that Knoxville Center Mall is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| He is very willing to work with Knox County, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| or whoever may be interested in working with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| to do a feasibility study to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| We're talking in terms of the schools possibly being out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| There's already been a floor print for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| Also, the three top ones, Belk, Dillard, and Sears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| are the ones that are owned separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| And he has talked with them each week, and they are also very interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| Our host state, we have a governor who is pushing for trade schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| We have the perfect place for a trade school out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| We are pushing education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| We have the Hope Scholarship where everybody can go to school now for two years free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| and we are in shortage of our electricians, our plumbers, our mechanics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| and all of that that we've all been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| And there's so much out there that could be happening out there at Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| The mall is not coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Malls are going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| That area out there is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| It also touches right across the street with Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| It touches essentially across the street with Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| But as well as all the surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| that Knox County can stand up and be a leader and pursue this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| the economic development that people will follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| and come out there to make that into town up and live again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| So we wanted to do this to let the public know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| because there's so many rumors going around about Easttown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| But it is for sale, and he is willing to talk with the county and see what we can come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:34| So as a District 2 commissioner who's elected, I'm speaking, Randy, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| as District 2 commissioner who represents my district, who elected me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| as well as all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| we are the commissioners that have a responsibility for what is best for our Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:59| So this is something that I feel we need to make sure that we have sought out every avenue there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:08| to make sure that we are doing the best investment for our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:15| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| You called a point of order. Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| Mr. Law Director, the county's not allowed to enter into negotiations with entities that owe back taxes, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| The county is not allowed to enter any contracts with people who owe back taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| That's under resolution by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| All right. Moving on to Commissioner Smith, was that the direct result of your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| I've got some other lights on for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| Okay. Commissioner Anders, then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| The motion on the floor, I can support most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| When you have a conversation, I was going to bring up the point with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| We can't enter into conversations on a study with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| So we would have to have the right to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| Going back to the resolution, you talked about roofs and stability of the buildings and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| We can't enter onto that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| Number one, we have no reason to enter onto that property and inspect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Number two, we can't enter into a negotiation to enter onto that property for that purpose until the taxes are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| So we can't have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| But the biggest point about the whole thing is the economic viability of that building is not the responsibility of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:44| The economic viability of that region and that area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| And so if you want to amend the motion, or I'll make a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| to authorize the mayor and the city and KCDC to have a conversation about the area, I'll have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| But if we're just going to have it about just Knoxville Center and talk about the stability of his building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| the roof and the cable, the Internet access, everything up here has been a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| But Knox County government is not responsible for the economic viability of that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| or the responsibility for the area and the infrastructure around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| And I think that we need to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| This is one of those deals where, I mean, the guy got a great deal on the property per square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| and we don't have a group of offices that we need to put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| And if we're, you know, the city right now is building out St. Mary's at 180 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| And so if you use those numbers, you're up into $150 million on that building alone if you don't tear anything down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| And so I think we need to tread lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| I think we need to work with the city on the economic viability of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| Because if you look around, you know, Target and Lowe's and Home Depot, they seem to be doing okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| But there are some traffic issues we need to fix out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| and I'll be more than willing to invest in some of that infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| But I don't think Knox County needs to enter into a business contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| with a business who hasn't paid their taxes consistently over the last five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| And we've just got to be careful what we're dipping into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| I'm going to get to Commissioner J. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| And I recognize Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| But, Mayor, if you don't mind, I'll add a couple of lights to come on, and I'll get to you quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| But back to Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| I'd be happy to defer for a moment to hear from Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Okay. So Commissioner J. defers his space to Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Just real quickly, this is a cost-per-square-foot estimate that was put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| for moving the operations from Knox County government from the city-county building to the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| So I'd like to pass that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4014)|
| 1:07:09| All right. Go ahead, Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| I'd just like to â€“ perhaps the Law Department can answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| This property is in the city of Knoxville, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| Would any redevelopment not be under the jurisdiction of the city and KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| All the legal aspects of the redevelopment, whether you get permits or codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| or that kind of thing, would be under the jurisdiction of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| A plan for redevelopment is a policy decision as to whatever this board wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| and they can deal with whoever they want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| But, yes, it would be â€“ any kind of a licensure, any kind of code issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| would fall under the jurisdiction of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| All right. Thank you. Any follow-up on that, Commissioner J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| Yeah, I just â€“ as it relates to whether it be the motion or the amendment to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| or the substitute, I'm not exactly sure where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| so I'd love for some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| But I just â€“ I would like to just lodge my disapproval for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| and I will not be voting on any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| I think it's a colossal waste of time for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| The private sector has winners and losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| It's not government's job to pick those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| The mall, as it was, is a failing business, so it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| You have 88 acres on the interstate of flat land accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Let the private sector do what it does best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Find opportunities for people to come in and redevelop that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Keep it on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Find opportunities for people to move forward and develop it into something spectacular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| It could be manufacturing. It could be housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| It could be a combination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| But that's not our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| That's not our â€“ this body's job is to pick properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| and decide what to do with it and move in to make it more government building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| I just â€“ I'm baffled by why people are spending so much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| trying to have government have a bigger footprint on a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| that will produce no tax revenue if it becomes a government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| We don't create jobs. We create opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| And this is an opportunity for somebody to pick up a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| and move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| It's been closed for a matter of weeks now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| and we ought to let it have an opportunity to see who can redevelop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| see who can talk about what the potential is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| But to turn it into a giant government complex I think is a complete waste of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| And I'm looking at the numbers that Mayor Jacobs just proposed or showed us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| and it just seems absurd with all of the back work that we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| to catch up on road infrastructure, land use infrastructure, schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| that we would even fathom spending $152 million on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| when we have so many other priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| We did a strategic retreat where we talked about our priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| and this is not one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| So I'll just say my piece there and let it be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| You know, we have an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| What we talk about opportunities is zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| We were charged, I think you said, to try to get some information about the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| the last time we had this come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| So I went out and started asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| I went to a developer, one developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| There's a big developer here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| and I was talking to him how much it would cost to redevelop that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| Well, he said, you know, it's funny about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| We were looking with other developers of trying to get part of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| to put a trade school in there to help us in our trade of developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| You know, we need electricians, plumbers, welders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| and he just went down a litany of things that they need for that industry here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| I thought, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| So I went to another developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| They didn't know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| I mean, they knew each other, but they didn't know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| They were talking about the things about what we needed in trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| So immediately I called Nashville and talked to Bill Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| to what he could do to put, you know, some schools like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| secondary, post-secondary training for people that need jobs to be trained for this public out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:33| And so I'm going to be meeting with one of the governor's people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| probably Wednesday of this week, Tuesday or Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| They said they'd call me when they got in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| and I was trying to leave my schedule open to talk to them about what kind of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| Also, the President of the United States talked about CTE classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| this sort of thing here to where you have federal money that could come into this too to help defray this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| But if you really looked at the property that we do have that we could sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| and put back on the tax roll and take that money and purchase the land where we're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| then we have other properties going back on the tax rolls, like the Sears building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:15| rural high school, the Sarah Simpson building, the health department, even the public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:23| Put that on one location and put the rest of those properties back out there and sell that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| and maybe do it that way, and then the private sector could buy parts of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| to put their town centers that they talked about developing that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| where we could put those pieces back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| But we don't know what the opportunities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| You know, it's a funny thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| There's opportunities here, but everybody can tell me why it won't work instead of saying maybe it could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| Why are we so negative about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Why don't we take a little bit of time and see what we can do to retrain to the top trades that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:05| which is going to be for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| But if we go here and say, hey, I'm not going to vote for this because, you know, I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| We're not going to move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| We don't have to move all the city county buildings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| We've got a lot of overcrowding here at this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| We've got overcrowding in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| But to not take a real good close look when we can get this property at a very good price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| it's not going to be developed back into another mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| If you look online, you know how many failing malls there are across the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| And they're all looking for some ways to redevelop that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| We could use it to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| We could use it to spur off additional, you know, kind of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| And, like I say, retrain the public how to work in the kind of environment that we're going to have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| and in the future in the business world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| But it always amazes me how everybody can tell me why we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| but nobody can tell me why we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| It's just such a negative attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| I just don't understand why we can't work together and see if it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| If it won't work, it won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| But if it does work, think about the positive end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| But you go ahead, vote no on maybe advancements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| but that's your all's job to do is vote yes or no or up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| I really just want to say that I do support the idea behind Commissioner Bigg's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| Now, whether or not there are things in it that we maybe can't do because of the situation with the current property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Maybe the language could be modified somewhat to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| But I do support the idea behind it at doing a feasibility study of what could be done with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| Now, I agree with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| It's predominantly a private sector issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| The private sector, that's who's going to really determine whether the Knoxville Center Mall property flourishes in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| I don't know that a mega-government complex is the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| But one of the questions I was asked when I stood before this body to try to get the appointment to this seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| was about partnerships between government and the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| So maybe this is an opportunity for just such a partnership as Commissioner Bigg's suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| As the commissioner that represents all of east and northeast Knox County outside the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| the most common question I get asked by far is what is going to happen with the Knoxville Center Mall property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| Is the county looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Is there anything you guys can do to see that this property can flourish again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| I think there are situations, there are properties whose importance to an area of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| rise to such a level that maybe the government does need to step in and see what can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Yes, and I just want to reiterate what Commissioner Beeler has just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| We are not trying to bail anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| We're simply saying we should pursue a study in finding out what works best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:26| I mean, we're going over here, how long have we been, TVA building's been sitting empty for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| and so what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| We're talking about all the money that's going to be costing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| and we have to renovate every one of the offices over there in Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| None of them are fit to move an office in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| And so we're not talking about pennies with the TVA East Tower move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| So it's been empty 15 years, and all we're saying is we think we should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| as a county commissioner, I feel like we should check every avenue possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| and not have blinders on to say what will work or what won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| And we're not talking about moving all the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| We're saying let's give East Town Center a look at to see what can develop from a partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4638)|
| 1:17:27| and people wanting to make what's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| Thank you, Commissioner Carrington. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| I just want to say, because I represent the eastern portion of this city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| and I want to make sure as we look at this resolution, even from the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| the feasibility study is not just for Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| It is for the connectivity of that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| It expands beyond the boundaries of the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| So this isn't just a conversation about East Town Mall. It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| This is about the level of connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| and the nature of how we can build a better eastern portion of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| So the mall may be one component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| It is not the entire conversation for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| And I think if the friendly resolution that we spoke of in the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| is to have a feasibility study, to have a conversation with both the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| and have a public process to look at that entire eastern section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| because it needs to be all tied together, not just looking or focusing on this mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| The mall is not just the eastern side of that town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| There are large existing businesses that want to have a conversation centered around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| how they can have better connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| And I think that really is where we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| if you want to look at how we can redo this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| So I just need to make sure we say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| And I'll just say, speaking as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I know we're going to be going back to get this, Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| this restated just so when we get to a vote eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| everybody's going to need to know exactly what they're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| just because it's been a few minutes since we talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| Where I am on this one, my personal challenge on this one is that we've got the â€‘â€‘| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:31| we get a ton of incremental savings and efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| by sharing this building with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| anything from utilities to communications to shared services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| And the city's been really clear, at least on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| we've heard from multiple folks that there's no interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| in them vacating this particular building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| And some of the incremental savings and synergy that you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| from our coâ€‘location here would be lost with this move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| And also, unlike a move potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| and we talked about TVA a lot at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| but the TVA situation was where you had a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| that was not on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| It was already a government building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| So one of the reasons that I saw in favor of that, for me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| was you're talking government to government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| and you're netâ€‘net having an incremental gain to your tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| by moving government to another government building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| than truly freeing up another building to go back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| So that's where I am on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Now, would it be helpful to have a regional development program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| and an enterprise zone area looking at that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| But I guess where me personally, I respect everybody's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| but where I am personally on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| it's just for me it's a tough one to swallow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| just because of where I'm seeing incremental savings and efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| where we are right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| and the net incremental increase in tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| by truly getting something going back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| Because it would be difficult for us to move out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| and then you kind of sell half of this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| if you can't really get the city out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| It would be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| So that's my two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| Now, I'm working my way through the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| trying to recognize everybody in honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Commissioner Jay had spoken earlier, but he gave to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| But now Mayor Jacobs, I am recognizing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| I apologize for inserting myself in this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| That's okay. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Commissioner Carringer said that TVA has been abandoned for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| It's actually been completely vacant for less than one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| So I just want to point that out. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| Actually, I didn't hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| Commissioner Carringer said TVA has been vacant for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| It's actually been completely vacant for less than one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Now, working back through the list, back to Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| I'd like to call for the question. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| All right. Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| I'd like to be recognized. I haven't spoken on this topic yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| All right. Yeah, back toâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| I thought I had you earlier, butâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| That was just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| That was just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| So your point of order is that you hadn't been asked to speak on this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| So the chairâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| What I spoke up for earlier was a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| That was a point of order. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Okay. Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| That was, but you didn't speak on this subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| because I had you noted as speaking, but that was a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| You'll be recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| and then we're going to go and acknowledge the question has been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Then we're going to have to have a vote on the vote being taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| Well, I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| So we've had toâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| First of all, we've had the question called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| We need to have a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Soâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| Mr. Ballard, when the question is called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| do we need to do this roll call vote, or can that be a voice vote on the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| It can be a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| And what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Does it need to be a simple majority, orâ€”?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| We're going to have to have a vote on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| So the question has been called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| so we just need a simple majority, which we can do to move to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| When the question is called, it takes a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Well, he's called the question, so we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| So the question has been called, so the Chair will open a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| All in favor ofâ€”and a reminder of what we're having a vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| We're not having a vote on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| Mr. Biggs has called the question, which means that we first vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| whether we're going to have the vote, then we move to the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| and then if there's a substitute on that, that can be taken care of then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| So back to Commissioner Biggs' thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| All in favor of having the vote, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| This is for the call, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| This is the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5032)|

| 1:32:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| This is just a professional opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| of our own procurement department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| and really, to determine the status of a mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| not the feasibility of an area, but the status of a mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| This disinvestment, aside from a private entity of the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| just the general disinvestment from the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| for years in this entire area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| needs a greater conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| But yet we've just now decided that this is our priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| That's really unacceptable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| And I just need further direction on what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| Mr. Gill has posed a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| I will look to law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| I'm not sure what the question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| Is what we have done within the scope of what the county can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:11| Well, the only legal issue that I've heard, and you have to remember what the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:18| with somebody in taxes is, is they cannot enter into a contract to do business with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| That's what the resolution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| Whether or not they give you permission to come on their property would be up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| I don't know that that's a business contractual agreement whereby there's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| To what degree you want to do a study and to what policy level that's between administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| and commission, how you want to do an RFQ, usually that would be done by purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:52| The how-to was not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| The what was addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| So the elements of the RFQ, in other words, if the purchasing put out an RFQ, then they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5636)|
| 1:34:07| would look at, I think it was transportation, buses, environmental study, TDOT for general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| transportation, and then the roof and the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| And the potential, study potential, to me, if I'm reading it right, was the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| development potential of what could be done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| That was my interpretation of what was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| That's overall broad policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| The how-to, I'm not sure, was clear, but if you're talking about an RFQ, to me, you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| be asking purchasing to look at an RFQ to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| And then y'all would come back and vote on that as to see whether it's feasible financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Okay, so the Knox area transit already goes to Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| So then the conversation extended to TDOT, not to the city, and then to the private capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Does that encumber the county if the RFP is requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| We could pay for the assessment of buildings we don't have the permission to enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| Well, let's say, however, y'all do the RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| That's what, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| And what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| And what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| The Purchasing Department does fall under the Mayor's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| The Mayor and the Chair recognizes him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| For the record, I believe that this is a very unwise use of taxpayer money, and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| veto this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Going back to our order of lights, I acknowledge Commissioner Biggs, that I would come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| And I've got Biggs, Carringer, J. Smith in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| Just in general terms, the RFQ is kind of left so open about the transportation, environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| quality, and Internet and things of that nature, you can dial down the scope of work whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| we submit the RFQ for that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| That's why I worded it the way that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| Is that correct, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| You can define whoever it is that this board wants to send to work with purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| Purchasing would look at what the potential, I think you said study potential, I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| economic development potential for a third party to look at, and you want it included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| in that look for economic development, those elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| That's all that I understand at this point what this body has asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| All we were putting out is to say this area is in need, the entire area over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:10| We're not saying all government to go over there and buy all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| We're saying we need to take a look at it and see what we can do, and like we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| like a trade school to put in over there, and for private sector to at least, hey, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| we did the senior center for John's district, they went down, they scoped out the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:40| and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| That was private property, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| We did that before anything ever took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| There's no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| We are looking at what is going on in our city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| We're not even, I mean, we don't know, we're not even talking about the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| We're talking about what are the possibilities that we could do over there to seek it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5877)|
| 1:38:05| We're not saying anything has to be, you know, we're not talking about buying all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| and putting all county offices and all the city offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| You all are like jumping way ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Right now, it has been to propose to put the schools over there, and the schools have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:25| voted or whatever, and we can't just push them out of the AJ building, so it is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:33| to look at that area over there, the entire area, to give it a fair look and to do our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:44| due diligence in finding what's best for everybody in Knox County, whether it's for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| private companies coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| We're not talking about putting any price numbers or buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| We're just saying, do we not owe it to the Knox County taxpayers to look at this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| and all to see what the possibilities could be and what our entire Knox County, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| taxpayers would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| And that's all, I mean, we do it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| We go on to private property and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| So that's not something that we've never done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| So I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| How do you ever get any kind of business going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| Everything's private until the government buys it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| So all we're wanting to do is to be fair to the taxpayers and seek out everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| because I'm going to tell you, not one single person in my district has ever called me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| say that they are for what we're talking about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| That's been in discussion now for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| I'm not having one person in my district say that they're for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| So I owe it to my district to make sure I have searched and researched everything out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| there and to see what the possibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| This isn't against, has nothing to do about being against anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| It's about doing our work and making sure that we make the best decisions for Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:13| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Next, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| This is my final thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| I think we ought to at some point move on to the rest of the agenda here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| The job that you just described and the resolution that passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| these are the jobs of the KCDC in the city, the Development Corp in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| This is not the job of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| Purchasing that would put together this RFQ, RFP of some sort, is under the mayor's direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:47| And the mayor just sat here and said this is a colossal waste of Knox County taxpayers' resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| I don't imagine that the mayor is going to look to his department that he manages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| and say spend real time and money and effort on this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| So I think, again, I think it may be a Christmas miracle that Evelyn, Gil, and I are on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| But I think this is a big waste of time without a big conversation that has something to do with a real purview of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:20| So I'll leave it at that, and I think we ought to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| I do have three commissioners that have asked to chime in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| I want to recognize Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| This is the first time I have sat on a commission, and I usually don't talk a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| I usually wait to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| So I would like to go ahead and read what my substitute motion was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| I was going to make a substitute motion asking the county mayor and the city mayor through KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| to study the highest and best use for the area known as East Town Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| and how the government could assist in its redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:06| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| The proposal is an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:27| It's a request for a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| That does not mean that this commission has to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| Right now, zero money has been spent no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Anybody says it's waste taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| It's not a waste taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| Nothing has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| It has to come back to this 11-member body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| And there's nothing wrong with Commissioner Bigg's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| There's nothing wrong with Randy's amendment, which I wish he would have, don't wait so long the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:59| What will happen is that a request for a quote by procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:07| if the mayor is willing and purchasing is willing, you can sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| And commissioners can go and put their, see what they want inside that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| Then after all that's done, it's just a request for a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| And a lot of times, not a lot of times, sometimes you send out a request for quotes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| and you don't get any response, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| So it will be dead from that point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| If you do get a request for quotes, then it comes back to this commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| If it's a dollar or if it's $100,000, we've still got to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| And if we think that, and I think that it's way out of line, I will vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| If it's in line, it's not a waste of taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| We have to see what the RFQ, and we have the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| Can I ask for one point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| From the Purchasing Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| An RFQ is a request for qualifications, not a request for a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| Commissioner Gale, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Next, Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| I have just two comments, one kind of point of information and then one point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| Five years ago, when I started the process of finding a new senior center for the seniors in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| as I found a location, I would contact Buzz Buswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| In turn, Buzz would contact the owner or the authorized representative of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| He would also contact the Procurement Department, and we would go out and we would view the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| We'd go into every closet, every bathroom, every mechanical room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| One location, I was about ready to climb up on the roof just to look at the AC, and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| No, no, they'll take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| So in every location we've gone to, we had permission from the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| I don't think anybody assumes we're just going to start going around Knoxville Center Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| and doing investigative work without the permission of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| And then the point of clarification, sitting next to the law director, when the question was asked that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| whether we could enter into a contract with someone who has not paid their property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:31| he said, No, you cannot enter into a contract, but that does not preclude you from entering into any discussion stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:40| So you can negotiate with the owners of this property if you so wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| but you cannot enter into a formal contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| The resolution actually is talking about contracting to do business with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| You cannot enter into a contract to do business with Knox County if you owe taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| That's what the resolution says, and that's about all it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| So anything beyond that, I think you can do fair game with anybody you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| They just can't enter in to do business with Knox County, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Back to you, Commissioner Bussler. I'll say one final word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| Randy made a point there that we're doing a feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| We're seeing about how the buses run, and we do all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| and we get somebody to go out there and take a look at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| If he's any good at all that we hire to do this, they come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| hey, this property's not good for what you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| It's not good for this, but it's good for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| And then you can go to the IDB board and all like this and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| this is the property we have that could be, this is the best use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| And that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| We're not looking at right now what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| It may be something completely different than we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| So, Randy, it was a good idea, and I think this study can lead us in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| if we go ahead and start doing something now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| Commissioner Beeler, I think you're one of the few folks that hasn't weighed on this recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| I think I might have before the question, but I'll be extremely brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| So I'll recognize you, then I'll recognize Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| No, I just wanted to offer one comment that if indeed this is a fiscally irresponsible measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:32| the county mayor has gone on record before this body that he will veto it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| which is his right and responsibility as the chief fiscal officer of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| And my two cents worth on this is in real estate investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| we often have to complete a feasibility study if you're looking at building a hotel or any type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| I guess I would caution us, and however this goes down through the purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| I want to make sure and be on the record that we're not at the county taxpayer dollar funding a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| I know we're calling this an RFQ or RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| but I want to make sure that we're not going down the path of actually having the government pay for a feasibility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| which is something that is used primarily in the real estate development business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| So that's my final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| I recognize Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I think the difference in what you're saying is when you're taking buzz with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| we're looking at property to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| We're not looking to take contractors on that property to do work to give an assessment of a private-owned building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:46| That's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| I think my only question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| I've never heard where the money's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| I can tell you that Matt thinks this is going to cost anywhere between $250,000 and $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6534)|
| 1:49:02| So I need to know where we're going to get that appropriation from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| The resolution, I believe Mr. Biggs, Commissioner Biggs said the resolution said out-of-county commission funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:13| That's the first discussion he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| I think the reading of that was the first, was what I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| I don't think there's enough there to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| He answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| There's not enough money in the county commission budget to cover a $250,000 study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:40| We never pass a resolution without a fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| So I think the question is, how are we paying for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| I believe that will be discussed whenever we see the qualifications there, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| Would it not be then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| No, I think we normally do it ahead of time, and then we come back with the contracted amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| So you put the dollar amount you're going to pay them before you even see their qualifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| I think we normally have a budgeted amount that we would go with and then go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| I think we have an idea of what this study would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| It's going to be based off square footage of the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| I think when you get your price tag back, you're going to be surprised by the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| I mean, it's going to be at least a quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| That's what you feel, just like the $152 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| I think Matt Myers, the head of procurement, feels that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| I think Russ Watkins, who is CEO of Partner Development, feels that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| So I think we have some experts here that know what things cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| Just a quick question, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| If we have data that is already existing on that structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| could we not just check to see if that data is accurate and it would cost less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| I don't know if Matt would want to use the data of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| Oh, I thought we already looked into this for potentially buying it previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| We looked into leasing the property, and then last week when this idea came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| we took what Commissioner Bussler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| He wanted to move and put a price per square foot to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| It's an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| And we know that the city of Knoxville currently at St. Mary's is spending $187 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:32| We know jail space is considerably more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| So I think this study has nothing to do with moving government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| It has to do with seeing how we can help this developer sell this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| It's still going to come at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| And so I think the cost of the study is going to be six figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| We have both Commissioner Geale and you're light on Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| She's killed two birds with one stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| I'm good, because the city still has no rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| You are recognized, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| Mr. Chairman, we voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Can we move on with our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| I wish to express what's going to happen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| We have 15 minutes left and multiple items on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| We have a zoning meeting that is going to start at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| We will have an approximately 10-minute recess at around 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| Madam Chair, can you review for me what are the next few items on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| I think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| I think we're probably going to have some discussion on that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| I think now might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Well, there's people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| I know we have some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| We can go ahead and start this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| I'm really not sure if we're going to get to a conclusion before we have to start the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| So, if we have to get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| Point of order on the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| If you have a motion on the floor, you can't suspend the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| So, I mean, if they want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| I mean, we can offer them to stay until after the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| But if they want to speak and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| Right now, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Because it's also first reading and there's another public hearing and another vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| So, back to what Commissioner Anders had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| Ms. Cooley, I'm looking at you right now, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| As well as others who have spoken are expressed an interest on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| For an ordinance to become law or part of our charter, there are multiple steps that need to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| It needs to be read through and approved twice at different meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| And I'm saying this also for the folks who may be watching this meeting at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| So, anything that may happen tonight is not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| Additionally, one of the outcomes that we need to do at this meeting is to schedule a public hearing on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| Which will take place before the second reading of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| The law department, well, I shouldn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| But this is not a zoning ordinance, so it doesn't need a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| All right, let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| Ms. Cooley, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| And Madam Clerk, if you could go ahead and read this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| I just don't think we're going to get, we're not going to finish it before we have to go to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| This is on page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, amending Knox County Code, Chapter 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6864)|

| 1:54:59| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| Caroline Cooley, 903 Wingate Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| Hello, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| I'm glad I'm able to address this issue with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| I'm a retired physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| I practiced here in Knoxville for over 35 years in nephrology and internal medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| I have personally witnessed the decline in the public and the health of our citizens in this community and across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:30| A component of this decline is that we lack adequate built environment for people to move around other than in a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:41| A fundamental function of government is building a transportation system that serves all residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6941)|
| 1:55:49| not just those driving motor vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| Sidewalks are essential for safe and convenient mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| They should be built with a connected network so that people can get from one location to another without risking their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:07| There should be a network wherever there's housing, businesses, and other institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| They should be included in the project design plan with pedestrian and other nonmotorist safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| and convenience is a high priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| Where there are no sidewalks, there will be less walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| I noticed on the agenda workshop that it was stated there were not incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| significant crashes in the neighborhoods with 26-foot right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| That's because people don't walk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| They know it's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| They can feel it, and evidence has shown that, that people know when it's an unsafe environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:49| A person walking has a 50% chance of being killed if hit by a motor vehicle going 30 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:56| At 40 miles an hour, 90% of pedestrians will not survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7016)|
| 1:57:03| Communities with sidewalks are healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| There are lower rates of obesity in walkable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| Knox County and the state of Tennessee have higher obesity rates than the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:18| One-third of Knox County citizens is overweight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| One-third is obese, and only one-third is normal weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| And this is not just because of individual choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| It's because also the factors of them not being able to move any other way than in a motor vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7052)|
| 1:57:40| One-fifth of Knox County youth are overweight or obese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| They cannot walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| They cannot walk to friends' houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| They cannot get to the playground to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| So their physical activity levels are lower than recommended amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7073)|
| 1:58:02| Obesity and diabetes result in higher health costs and the development of chronic diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:11| And less physical activity in the United States has contributed to decreased life expectancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:18| And this has been just in the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| it has been shown that the middle-aged population is actually having a decreased life expectancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7101)|
| 1:58:31| Walking improves mental stress, loneliness, and improves social interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| It is not ethical to build a street that is inherently dangerous for the people who will use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:45| Sidewalks are a foundation of a healthy, safe, and happy neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| You have or will receive communication regarding this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| from neighborhood organizations and individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| This has not been a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| And I request that at least you postpone the vote on this ordinance to get some more public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| All right. Thank you, Ms. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| And if you've got notes with your speech you'd like to leave for the record, you're welcome to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| Her name was Ms. Caroline Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| She did say her, I can't remember what the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| 903 Wingate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| Ms. Cooley is at 903 Wingate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| All right. We are at what I would describe as a pretty good stopping point for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| So what I'd like to do is put the commission meeting into recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| We can come back and discuss that particular ordinance when we come back after the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| Well, so I'm going to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| We're going to take about a 10, maybe 12-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| We'll try to reconvene for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| It will be just a little bit after 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| So thank you, everyone, for your patience in being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part1?start=7206)|
