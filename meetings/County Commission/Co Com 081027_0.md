| 0:01:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Clerk, we'll have our first item, number 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| This is consideration of suspension, revocation of the beer permits for the following establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| 5A is Big D, 6501 Manorville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| Rathgill is our owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| This is first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Is there anybody here from the Big D who would, okay, if you'll come to the podium, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=141)|
| 0:02:36| Mr. Law Director, they were serving beer or selling beer to underage six-pack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=156)|
| 0:02:44| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Before we get to the individual podium, is this individual or this business, does it come under the Responsible Vendor Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| It does not, which then, of course, gives you greater power and authority than just a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| You can actually seek revocation if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| If you put a first offense in accordance with the Nock County Beer Laws, it's $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| Mr. Law Director, that is $500 or a choice of 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| They get the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| $500 is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Do I hear a motion, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| We have one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| We have five of these for first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| And I would just like to let those who are here know that this board has taken action to revoke licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| We did it last month and will not hesitate to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| So we're not going to revoke your license today, but I'm just saying that in the future, be very careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| because we take serving to underage very seriously and we do not hesitate to revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| So just a word of warning to those who will be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=230)|

| 0:04:11| I make a motion that we do a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=251)|

| 0:04:22| $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| And what Mr. Hammond said, we have revoked them in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| So just be careful of the people that you're workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=266)|

| 0:04:52| or suspend your license for 30 days, and they would give you some determination as to your choice on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=292)|

| 0:08:41| Sue Morton, I think you've already heard earlier, $500 fine, 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Do you have a preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=526)|

| 0:08:56| Yeah, I'd still like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| How did it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=537)|

| 0:08:59| Misread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| I mean, he looked at it, but he didn't realize that it was 88 instead of 87 on the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| But he's not there anymore either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=546)|

| 0:09:22| Mr. Minor, ensure, please, that these individuals who are fined know the time frame in which they have to pay that fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| Before they leave the building on the $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| No, I'm saying have they been briefed that as to the time frame in which to pay the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| Have they been so advised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| I haven't told them, but it's always been before they leave the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| The fine starts right when you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| It's my understanding that we actually give them seven days, but we'll need to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| Well, I guess I see Angie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=599)|

| 0:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Just ensure that those who are still here, within seven days, the fine has to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=606)|

| 0:10:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I'm here on a first offense, sale of beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| The board is giving you some leeway in that you can choose a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| Do you have a preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| A $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Motion for a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Mr. Norman, you might have a question for this lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Just wanted to know the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| The lady misread the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| She is no longer employed with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| On all these, don't there isn't there clearly a sign that says before this date, blah, blah, blah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| They evidently cannot see very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| They don't know their numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Maybe we need to get with the sheriff's department and make some bigger numbers or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| Do you tell your employees this is how much it costs you as a business owner, this is what it costs you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Any other discussion on this matter, 5E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| All in favor of the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Like sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Mr. Chair, I would like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| I understand there can be more than one offense before we go to automatic suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| How many offenses and does the fine increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| After the second fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| The second time they're up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Is the fine the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Is it $500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| The second fine is 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Section, second offense, excuse me, 60-day suspension, $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Third offense, 90-day suspension, $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Fourth offense, this is all in the 36-month period, six-month suspension, $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| Fifth offense is a consideration of revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| Now, mind you, we're talking about individuals who come under the Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| If they are not under the Responsible Vendor Act, then it defers to Tennessee statutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| which means you can actually revoke and you don't have to go through this graduated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| We used to do it in the third attempt, third trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| Mr. Law Director, I believe we've got a county ordinance that says how it's to be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| Does the state override our county ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| The state statute reads that no county may or the county is empowered to revoke someone who does not come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=771)|
| 0:13:00| under the Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| If the person comes under the Responsible Vendor Act, then we would carry on exactly as how ordinance relates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=781)|
| 0:13:09| But the preemptive authority is the state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| which reads that if you come under the Responsible Vendor Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| you do have to go through a graduated process of fines and then suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| If they're outside of that, which is why I asked in the beginning, if they're outside of the Responsible Vendor Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| in other words, they haven't done the certifications, haven't done the classes, then we're free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| this board is free to empower to revoke that license outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| They need not entertain fines or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| I know the last law director said that we would stay with their ordinance, you know, on the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| That's why I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=827)|
| 0:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Okay, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Any other questions for this lady?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=844)|

| 0:14:07| This is deferred applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| The first one is Ion Inc., a high school market and deli, 9443 High School Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| off-premises formerly high school market and deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=855)|
| 0:14:24| Good afternoon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Sir, last time you were here, it's my understanding that you were in the process of buying this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| And now has that sale been completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| The previous owner had a beer license, which will have to be surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Did he by any chance give that to you or is he present to surrender the previous license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| He's present and he's got the beer permit with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| And just, sir, for the record, I know we went through this last time, but just to have a clear record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| or any crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| As we already know that there is beer at this location before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| and there's an outstanding license that will be surrendered, is this for on or off-premises sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| Off-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| And now, presently, you do, in fact, own the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Does anybody else have an interest in the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| In other words, do you have a partner or anyone of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| And will you operate this or will you have a manager do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=922)|

| 0:21:13| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| You're operating a business there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| The store is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| So the only thing we're talking about here is if you had a fire tonight, you don't have that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1282)|
| 0:21:31| So if they sell beer where they don't sell beer, if they had a fire tonight, you've got to break in, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| If she's occupying it right now, she's doing that without a certificate of occupancy, which is a violation of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1297)|
| 0:21:49| How long has this box been ordered, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| We ordered like when he did the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| So he asked us to order, so after like a couple days after we ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| And that's actually we did it on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| It's coming from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| So it's going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| So how much time are we talking about already elapsed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| I don't know exactly when we did the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Last week sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| But in general terms, it doesn't take an enormous amount of time to get these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| Usually, like I say, at the most ten days from the time they order it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| Mr. Law Director, can we approve this pending installation of this box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| I had a question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| I took over one of the other stores on Westland Drive when they did the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| And they didn't ask for the Knox box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| And now this one I just took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| That was I took over like three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| That time I wasn't asked to have to have the Knox box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| And why on this tour I had to have the Knox box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Was the other store also in the county or was it within the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| It's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| I'd have to defer to the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| It's my understanding you said these are consistently enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| They are consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Does that mean that we haven't ever missed one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| Probably we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| It's a relatively new requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| It's a new requirement since the new international fire code was adopted last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| So can I say that every business in Knox County has one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| But as we come across them, we do require them to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Mr. Chairman, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| It has been stated and it is now on our record that this business may be operating improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| We need clarification of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Mr. Rosenberg, are they operating properly or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| No one from my office has been out to inspect this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| The fire marshal is having issues right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| There's no zoning issues right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| The building department and the fire prevention, whenever a permit is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| any time it's been closed for any extended period of time, we require a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| She did apply for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| She has had inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I think the building inspector released it and I had the one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| But until she passes a final inspection, we cannot issue the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| If they occupy a building without a certificate of occupancy, that is in violation of the adopted codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Now, the codes about whether you're speaking, you're talking about the building code or you're talking about the fire code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| The certificate of occupancy is required by both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Clearly, the safe issue would be or the fact that she's operating there now where I noticed that she's doing so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| and the fact that we have this locks back issue is troubling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| I would prefer, although there's no black letter law on this, that until such time as she comes into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| and she has a final CO, that the business shouldn't operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Whether or not we can do that from this board is questionable because this board is really restricted to the issuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| of a beer license and not the enforcement of the ancillary codes and other issues within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| Well, I'm not interested in closing the woman's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| But I just, since it is on the record, I wanted to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| So if this board doesn't have the authority to do it, then I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| We can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| On this permit to occupy a building, I asked for that nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1525)|
| 0:25:35| It's a safety factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| You know who's in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| And as far as I know, and I check pretty often, half the people in this town didn't get a permit to occupy a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1538)|
| 0:25:49| or better than half of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| I've asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| And the last time I was up there in the codes, Roy said that they was making them get permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| And they need to get a permit to occupy a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| That way, 911 center, the police department, fire department, everybody knows who's at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1567)|
| 0:26:16| It should be a county ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| I don't know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| I can't find it in the county ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| You want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| We had this discussion several years back with the beer board at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| The policy has been and is and has been that when we just have a change of ownership, the doors aren't closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1593)|
| 0:26:43| just a new owner coming in, we do not require them to get a permit because it just slows the process down tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| If the doors have closed and have been closed for any type of extended period of time, then we do require them to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1611)|
| 0:27:00| We in the fire bureau, I'm speaking for the fire marshal right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| do not feel it's necessary for everybody that walks through the door to get a permit if they've not done anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| If they're renovating the space or if they're occupying it after it's been closed for a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| and some of the features of the building may not be operating properly, then that's the time that we require them to have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| We do periodic inspections on all of these places, whether they come before the beer board or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| So, you know, it doesn't really make sense that if we've been out there two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| and then all of a sudden there's a change in ownership on the beer license for us to go out there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| And that's why we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Mr. Brewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| I think in light of this, I'd like to offer a substitute motion that we defer this one for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| to give her a chance to get all the things in order that she needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| I hear a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Can I state one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| It's not our intention to close this lady down, even though she is occupying it without the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| This is a relatively minor thing in the scheme of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| But we can't officially issue a certificate of occupancy until she's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Am I going to go out there and, you know, beat on the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| But it is something that, you know, until she's crossed all the I's and dotted all the I's and crossed all the T's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| we can't officially issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| It seems like we might be unduly penalizing her if we do defer this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| if in case what they're saying is that this Knox box will be in, certainly installed within seven to ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| No, it's not the Knox box that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| It's having the business operating without a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Well, she has to have the box before she can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Since she's complied, you know, so far with everything they've asked her for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| I don't see a reason to put it off for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| If it's seven, she can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Okay, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| That's what we normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| We will issue a letter once we've, if you all do it pending our approval, then if she gets it done in seven days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1758)|
| 0:29:27| and we go out and inspect her, we issue a letter to the clerk's office and she receives her beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| She doesn't have to wait the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Okay, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| I withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Do you have a second on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| And who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Was it Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| And you made with pending the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Okay, so that will answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Any discussion on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Ma'am, do you understand now what occurred here with all this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| So once you, the minute that box comes in, call the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| He'll come down, inspect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| You'll get the occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| The letter goes to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| You get your license issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| You're also operating illegally that we can't do anything about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| It's between you and whoever has jurisdiction over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| So you're taking your chances operating the next seven days or so until you get this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| Okay, we have one other item that we need to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Commissioner Norman, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| No, go ahead after we're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I just wanted to ask the sheriff's department something about all this rash of first offenses that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| So I'll ask that question after we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| If we can, if people will be checking your schedules, I'd like to meet as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| meet in the conference room up on the sixth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| And if we could, codes, if you can be there, UK and all the departments, fire marshal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| everybody that comes, we need to go over some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| UK, tell us some things that you're concerned about so commissioners can be thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| Mr. Chairman, the county ordinances we've got was in 91 or 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| We need to update them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| The laws are changing and we need to go over our codes and the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| Mr. Chairman, another attorney and I in my office, we have, in fact, accomplished that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| We have a complete rewrite updated until recently, the new 2008 changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| So when you have this meeting, we'll be ready to present to the board a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| we'd like to think a new and improved complete comprehensive overhaul of that which you currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| Now, you've only been here less than 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Commissioner Rapp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| And I'd like to see your meeting after the election and after the swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Yes, yes, it will be, yes, most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| And people, all of you all that we call on, if you will let me know what time you cannot be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| because I really value your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I want you all to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| We're going to learn from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Law Department, they want to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| But I want to work together as a group here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| And if you have some things that you think that need to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| I think it's very important that we try to work around your all schedule, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| So if, like, the third Friday of the month is out for you, just let us know and we'll try to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| And if you can't make it, have somebody there that can represent you and voice your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| And we'll be notifying you as to when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| But if you'll notify me as to, you know, what are bad days during the month of November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| we'll try to meet during November and we'll meet in this conference room on the sixth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Do you think this is something that we cannot do at the next board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| How?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Mr. Chairman, we could have lunch and meet at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| Yeah, well, that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| 1130, 1145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| How does that sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| We could just meet the day of our meeting and just have a luncheon or whatever in a small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| Be okay with you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| November 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Yeah, because we're going to meet early for November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| We'll meet a week early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| And have turkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Gobble, gobble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Will that give us enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| Yeah, that gives us time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Thirty minutes to go through and eat whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| That will give us a good, full, solid hour to discuss if we need to go into more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| Works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| If we can't get to a small assembly room, we could maybe all still get in the conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| What do you think, Tank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| That would be the next best place to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Or, you know, we could even meet here if we had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| You know how fast I talk, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| So, if that's a group, everybody, we'll just meet here at that time and be looking over the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Anything you want to tweak a little bit, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Even be talking to the law director beforehand, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| I just wanted to ask, since we had and we've still got all of the proprietors here that have testified today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2059)|
| 0:34:28| about these first offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| I wanted to ask somebody from the sheriff's department if, and I suspect that people can read numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| They know what the numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| This is somewhat, this is, something's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| So, commonly, what is, in your opinion, what is probably happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Is it somebody who's a young person who's selling the beer and they've got, you know, they're fudging for their buddies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| I mean, what's going on right here to have five of these back-to-back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| Is that a typical operation of somebody trying to get beer to somebody that's an underage person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2100)|
| 0:35:08| These citations were spread from April to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| Some of them are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| But mostly what we're finding is the clerk failure to check, closely check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2114)|
| 0:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Some of these have said, well, they misread the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I mean, how do you misread a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| And they've got a sign and it says, before this date, you cannot purchase alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| Well, so that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| I mean, they know the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| They know the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| They just, they're just not looking at the driver's license or the identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| Because our under 21 people take their own IDs, their driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| We don't try to fake them or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| And we have had at times from override the cash registers if they enter the correct date in the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| But mostly they're just not really paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| And a lot of times these smaller places that don't have a lot of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| they're just anxious to sell and they just don't look at the driver's license or their identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| Well, I'd like to emphasize again what Commissioner Hammond said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| and what Mr. Jarrett said about the Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And you don't have to have this progressive system of funds that this body can revoke license on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2181)|
| 0:36:29| So I'd just like to say that and appreciate you all's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Oh, you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Sir, step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| I'd like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Our regular commission meeting is going to be on the 17th of next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Oh, you wanted to have it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| We're going to meet at 1130 and go from 1130 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| State your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| My name is Virgil Carringer and I live at 315 Lupine in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| I think on the check in the ID card, I think most of them that said they got the wrong number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2232)|
| 0:37:25| that when they asked for an ID and they pulled it out and showed it to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| they're thinking, well, if they show me their ID, they're of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| And I think that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Because at our store, the lady said she checked it, but, you know, from a seven to nine, it don't even look close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2260)|
| 0:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| So I believe that is the real problem is getting them to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2271)|
| 0:38:00| Because we got a sign that big with numbers about three inches tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| If they was born before this date, they can't buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| And you change it every day, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| But she was a new girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| She wasn't young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| She was, I don't know, 30 maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| And she had been working a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| So basically they're looking at pictures first and skipping the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| Well, I'm not sure they even look at the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| When they pull the ID out, and I think in their mind that if they're showing me the ID, they're of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| And I could be wrong, but that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| I'll say where you're coming at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Mr. Carringer, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| So the point is whoever the seller is, it's just got to be emphasized that your business is in jeopardy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2335)|
| 0:39:04| as well as their job is in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| With that kind of warning, it seems like they, there would be especially a high degree of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| in terms of selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| And so as long as we get that across to every vendor in Knoxville, then we're going to have a lot less problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| And that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| And so the onus is on the owner of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| You all have to emphasize this to the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| We do very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| And with the threats and whatever makes them do the right thing if they do not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| Some people, you know, they could care less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| We don't hire them if we think they're going to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| You can't read somebody every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| And I know you're trying to do the best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| And the difficult thing is it's getting harder and harder to find good people to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| I'm sure you're finding that just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| And like you say, you can't really go back on them and garnish their wages or take it out of their check because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| there's no leave or you're going to have to let them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| So you're the one that's left with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| And you entrust people to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| But it's very, very hard sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Well, I thought this girl was, in fact, when Mr. Mining come out and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| is she still working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| And I said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| And he said, well, he suggested that she shouldn't be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| So when that happened, I let her go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| But it turned out, I'm not going to say any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2438)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Not much gets past Mr. Mining there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| I can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Yes, Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| I'd just like to say that we must keep in mind that it plainly states on these licenses under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| They don't really have to look at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| They'll just look at the license closely because it states under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Just to remind you, commissioners, before we adjourn that month of November and December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| we try to meet a week early on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| So we'll be meeting a little bit early in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| That's why we're going to have our 1130 meeting next time on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| If you're a commissioner and you want a flu shot, I think they're next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| And you commissioners must go first and see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| We'll adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| I've got CVS on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| I've had a problem with getting them certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| I've been for four months trying to get them certified, and I found that they'd misplaced their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2512)|
| 0:42:00| And I told them they'd have to come in and get a new license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2520)|
| 0:42:08| When the fellow come up to get the license, he wasn't certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| I asked the clerk's office to put them on the agenda for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| We need some help to get them to get their attention, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Just let me, tell me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I'll go down and sign them in for not having a, not being certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| Say that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| I can go down and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| I could sign them into the court or the billboard for failure to comply with the getting certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2560)|
| 0:42:52| What do you suggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2572)|
| 0:43:00| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2580)|
| 0:43:16| Yeah, the law department is going to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| So if you'll stay in touch with him, with that due process for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| I think one of the things that we need to go over when we have our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| because it's not quite clear about they have 30 days or how long they have to get certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| So we'll need to go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| U.K. has been telling them they have to, and it's good that they get certified before they get their beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| to come up here to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| But if they, if he's been trying to get them in for four months to get their certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| then we can sign them in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| If you all have anything you want to take before the law director's department before our meeting next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| just any changes so we can go through that and run it by them and let's get the discussions going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| So, Grant, thank you again for the maps that you gave us on this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| Anything else before the beer board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| To hear a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| First and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2658)|

| 0:47:06| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| I have two discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| The first discussion item is with our law director with regards to the outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| And the second discussion item is with regards to the reports we've been receiving about fees being waived by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| criminal and the Sessions Court judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| Okay, we'll take that at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| I have one, 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| I think all of us have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| Are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to add a discussion item also about the Veterans Day Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2857)|
| 0:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2868)|
| 0:48:05| I want to add everything that needs to be added, withdraw the things that need to be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| defer the things that need to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| Did you have something, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2895)|
| 0:48:24| Sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2904)|

| 0:48:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Resolution 914, is that still on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2911)|
| 0:48:41| I'd like to pull that off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| I had a call that the owner of that property is going to be here today and wanted a chance to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| and felt like he deserved at least that chance before we take a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| So if we just pull it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=2934)|

| 0:55:27| Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| Mr. Chairman, what this deals with is the three vacancies are vacancies created by former members of the Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3330)|
| 0:55:43| Commission who have since left office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| And when the Code Commission was reinstituted, three members are to be bodies of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| So it's up to commission to nominate the members that it would like to see serve on the Code Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3353)|
| 0:56:05| You hadn't asked any one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| Well, this is for a long time the Code Commission was defunct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| And the commission decided that it was a good idea and I agree to reinstitute the Code Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| What the Code Commission will do is prepare and see to it that the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| and the Knox County Code is published in a pamphlet form that would be available to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3390)|
| 0:56:38| and the members of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| And it would be updated annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| And, obviously, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| It's something that this commission should closely supervise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| And that's why it's important that three members of this body be involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| And so they will work closely in conjunction with my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| That's something that I would like to see happen sooner than later in terms of getting a publication together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| that contains both the charter and the ordinances updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| So if any members of the body would like to serve on the Code Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3431)|
| 0:57:20| we certainly appreciate the work and the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3440)|

| 0:58:55| the ladies in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| They're doing their governmental work today and looking over us and seeing what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| and how we run things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| Would you like to stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| I can't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| That's my boss on the left with the hat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3556)|

| 0:59:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| We have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| This is a very controversial subject in the second district, I suspect in the first as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| This area is a NIMBY and not in my backyard, but several are NIMBYs, not everything in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| And we're concerned that, you know, in effect we've created a de facto mission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| We've got to admit it to ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| And what we're really concerned about is that in the future we're looking beyond the confines of that area for a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| complete and thorough answer to our homeless situation and our permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| We all agree that housing first is a good model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| I think we believe on balance that historic preservation of Menville makes sense, even despite costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| because let's face it, there's not a private developer who currently wants to go into that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| What we're concerned about is the future and the burden on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| And we had a series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Commissioner Broyles and I had a sunshine meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| I think there was consensus at the meeting of something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| and I'm going to try it as an amendment to both the resolution and the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| And I'd like to propose the following amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Reallocation of these funds, $250,000, is contingent on the recipient's agreement not to seek additional government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3664)|
| 1:01:12| funds for any other permanent supportive housing projects within 1.7-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3672)|
| 1:01:21| I'm sorry, a two-mile radius of Menville and north of the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I think we can leave out that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| We think that that's a very reasonable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| It would block out many of the communities who are bearing a whole big chunk of the burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| And we'd like to see that as an amendment to this, both the contract and the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| I'll second that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| I need to add something to that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| I actually had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| I haven't had a chance to talk to Mark because we haven't sunshine a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| I had a meeting this morning with Jenny Weatherstone and some of the other people from the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| And I would like to amend the amendment to include two properties that are currently under review for permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3720)|
| 1:02:09| supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Neither one of them are in close proximity to the intersection of 5th and Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| which is where everything is being concentrated currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| So we would like to or I would like to amend the amendment to exclude those two properties that are currently being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| reviewed by the 10-year homelessness plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| They are within this two-mile radius, but they're already under review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| and they're far enough away from that intersection that I don't think anyone in this area will object to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| Where are those properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Yes, I'm John Waller from the 10-year plan office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| The properties we're currently looking at, we've looked at a property in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| and then looked at some properties off of Sutherland Avenue also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| One thing I'd like to point out about this two-mile radius is that it takes in portions of, I think, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3788)|
| 1:03:17| maybe four districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| No, three districts and four districts, and it doesn't include any one particular entire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3799)|
| 1:03:28| So we feel like this is a very fair way to kind of take the burden off the neighborhoods that are so close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3808)|
| 1:03:38| to this concentration of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| And also, we had a lot of input from people in this area who are very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3820)|
| 1:03:48| and quite frankly very skeptical that nothing else will be brought into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| And this is a way of reassuring them that we take their concerns seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| and that we do expect for the burden of this to be spread out and not concentrated in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3837)|
| 1:04:06| So we feel like this is a very fair way to handle this situation to both support the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| and also to support these neighborhoods who are bearing such an unfair burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| And I'd be happy to amend my motion to include the exceptions noted by Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| And do we have their specific locations or addresses handy or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| Yes, I'd like to get a little more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| I'd like to support the amendment, but generally South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| and it's not, you know, I need something a little more specific before I can get behind that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| Well, the north of the river thing will exclude this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| It will take care of the South Knoxville problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| And the other property on Sutherland, that would be outside the two miles anyhow, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| It depends where on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| It depends where on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Is it planned east or west of Concord?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| It's down there north of Forest Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Oh, in which case it's already outside the two-mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| We don't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| I mean, if these programs are already in review, under review, we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| So I think my original motion with just north of the Tennessee River and the two-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| the two things that Commissioner Broyles was talking about seem to be already outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| So I don't think there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| Commissioner Pinkston, you made the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| You okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| You okay with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Commissioner Saunders, you second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| I wasn't part of the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Oh, Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| I thought you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Oh, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| Original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| You have the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| He seconded the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Commissioner Pinkston, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| Yeah, I want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| So you're calling on me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| I didn't know whether you was calling on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| I'm in agreement with Mr. Harmon here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| I realize that you put these things normally where the property is cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| But we have a responsibility to treat every citizen of Knox County the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| Just because you're poor does not mean that you don't take pride in your community, your houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| It seems like the first, second, and ninth district are the places we're putting all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3980)|
| 1:06:29| And if you do go anywhere else, it's in the poor section of that side, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| but very few places to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| I would like to look for you to look at putting in at more affluent locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| even if we have to support helping the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| I think this is a problem that we've probably all created here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| but I think we all should have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| I think that I don't believe the second district wants all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| I know the ninth certainly doesn't and the first doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| So we need to look at putting these people all over Knox County instead of just in these three districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4018)|
| 1:07:08| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| I agree with everything both Commissioner Harmon and Pinkston said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| I guess I'd like to get a feel for what either the city or the county's departments that are running this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4039)|
| 1:07:27| responses to our concerns because, you know, it's okay to put something forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| that's not very specific about what you're going to do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| I mean, again, I agree with the Fifth Avenue Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| There's probably been a good fit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| But really, you know, if we had pinpricks for every facility that was under this two-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4063)|
| 1:07:52| I mean, I think we'd all be pretty shocked and surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| So I'd just like to get a feel and an understanding for where we're going next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| So if someone would like to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| Let me speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| John Lawler, 1504 Kennesaw Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| And, again, I'm the director of both Mayor Ragsdale and Mayor Haslam's 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4092)|
| 1:08:20| The critical piece to the success of the 10-year plan is this concept called permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| And many of you attended a lunch that we hosted when we talked about the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| and we talked about this strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| Our commitment from the 10-year plan office all along has been to spread this housing around Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| so that each neighborhood or each district, whether it's a commissioner's district or a councilman's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| will have its fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| We anticipate we will develop a we will and our strategic partner will develop approximately 400 units of permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| supportive housing over the 10-year duration of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| So it's we can't sit here and say we've got 10 sites picked out because the developer can only do these on a one-by-one basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4139)|
| 1:09:10| The developer acquires the appropriate funding for those developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| But our commitment all along has been and continues to be to spread these out throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| We do have a little bit of a problem with this idea of a 1.7-mile radius because that's approximately 10 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4161)|
| 1:09:31| These all need to be they have certain developmental characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| and they need to be spread out throughout the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| but close enough to the services that are critical to stabilizing the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| which will go into the housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| So our commitment is not to put another development in the area of the Fifth and Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4187)|
| 1:09:57| Our commitment is on a positive way to spread these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| So we want to be on record of saying we're going to spread these out throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| But it's really going to limit a lot of our options if we start establishing a parameter of 1.7 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| or whatever it is because the next community will want to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| And those kind of precedents scare us because we're going to run out of good developable sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| if the next commission district or whatever follows this precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| John, John, I appreciate your concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| but you have to understand the concern that the people have who are living in proximity to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| I don't think a two-mile radius is too much to ask, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| considering the number of not just homeless shelters and permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| but all of the halfway houses and the other low-income housing and everything else that's in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| Like Sam said, I think everybody would be shocked if we had a pen for everyone that's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| And I know that those aren't your concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| but this, for me, is what it's going to take for me to vote in favor, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| of spending this much money, frankly, on this kind of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| And like I said, there's a great deal of skepticism and, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| mistrust from the people who are in this area based on past actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| So, and some of that is misunderstanding and failure to communicate and all that, and I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| But this is something that these people who live in this area take very, very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| and are very much concerned about and very, quite frankly, skeptical about your intentions to spread them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| especially when you come in and say that this is going to limit you on where you put things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| Well, to us, that sounds like, well, they are planning to put something within this two-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| And that's, we can't, you know, we want to work with you and support you as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| but this is, I think, very important to the people who live in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| just to make sure that nothing else is developed in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| And I think your concerns are more than valid, especially in the Forth and Gill neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| and their proximity to CARM and Salvation Army and VMC and then this Menville development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| I understand that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| I think the little hesitancy we have is we hate to be limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| take a 12-square-mile area out of the available site selection that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| because this carries us into East Knoxville and even North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| and some sites that we might eventually look at and think this could be a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| So, again, you'll make the decision, and I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| I think we share the same interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| The interest is not to concentrate these things, and we're committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| But when you say that this excludes places that you might want to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| that leads me to think that there is going to be further concentration of services in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| If you would consider something two miles away from the Fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| and Broadway intersection a continuation of concentration, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| One of the reasons we made it two miles is because we're especially concerned about what's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| on the St. Mary's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| We want to make sure that permanent supportive housing does not go in to the St. Mary's building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| when it becomes unoccupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| That's very, very important to Oakwood-Lincoln Park and to Old North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| the neighborhoods that are bordering St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| That's a huge issue for those two neighborhoods who are very much affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| by what's going on at Broadway and Fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Those homeless people go through our neighborhoods and knock on doors and ask for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| And steal things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| Generally speaking, in this two-mile radius, order of magnitude, how many permanent supportive housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4431)|
| 1:14:00| whatever catchphrase you want to get, exist right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| Greater than 50 or less than 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| Or about 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Helen Ross McNabb probably has 20, 12 or so units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| No, I mean just separate facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| I don't mean beds or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Yeah, there is one over off of Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Because remember, it's very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| There are three on my street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| It's very easy to confuse different homeless service providers and what they do with permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4465)|
| 1:14:35| This is really a new concept that the tenure plan is bringing to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| but it's been proven in other communities to help chronically homeless individuals succeed in their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| Helen Ross McNabb has done one development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| They're contemplating three more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Menvilla will be the next one in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| There just aren't any right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| and that's why we're working feverishly to get these things developed and trying to identify the right sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| Well, this was a good-faith compromise that we put forward last night at our community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| that made people who were against this giving another quarter of a million dollars to the Menvilla project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| made them say, okay, we can accept that if we get some assurance from the tenure plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| And that's what this was, a compromise to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| So we're going to hold up our end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| We ask you to please hold up yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| Yeah, and I, you know, a little pain in the corner here because this positional bargaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| I don't know what to say to you other than we have a commitment not to concentrate it in that Fifth and Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| You know, we would like the latitude to be able to choose beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| We want the commitment in writing, sort of a trust but verify kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| I mean, because the community has been burnt too much before, and that's why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| I believe you're a man of your word, but, you know, we're a government of laws, not of men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| and this is a law that we think makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Commissioner Breed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| I had a question really for the law director, if anyone from that department is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| You know, we put these stipulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| I know Commissioner Pinkston did this on that autism house over there on the other side that he would approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| but it had to always be for autism only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| And sometimes I know Commissioner Leuthold has said, well, we'll approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| but they can't approve the sale, but they can never have a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| And I was wondering what, you know, does this legally, does it legally have any binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| even if we agree with what the commissioners from the second district say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| Can another commission come back later when we're not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| And, I mean, does this have the force of law behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| I mean, because this is a resolution and not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| Well, Commissioner Briggs, my resolution, my amendment was to put it in both the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| and the resolution, which I believe will give it stronger force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| I guess what my question is, can a commission come back eight years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| or six years from now when most of us aren't here and say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| we want to build something in there closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| You know, these folks come back because that's a ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| And I'm just asking, how much force does that actually have legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4649)|
| 1:17:40| Any action by this commission, whatever this commission decides is good policy today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4660)|
| 1:17:50| another commission years from now can change that policy by a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4670)|
| 1:18:02| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| I'll yield to you if you'd like to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| I was just going to ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Could we amend this ordinance to where it takes two-thirds of any other commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4694)|
| 1:18:24| If you pass a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| Are you talking about an ordinance or a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| If it's a resolution that he has, but if it's recalled that it takes two-thirds of a commission to recall it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4711)|
| 1:18:39| Would you go along with that, Mr. Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| If we can do it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| I think you would have to, right now, under the rules of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| there are only certain types of resolutions that require a two-thirds majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| So you would have to amend your own rules to specify this particular subject to require a two-thirds majority down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4736)|
| 1:19:09| on the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| You know, in six or eight years, we may have this far enough under control that it's not such an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| I spoke out of turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| John Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| Do you know where the next one's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| Our biggest concern right now is being able to acquire the necessary funding sources to do the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| That's the biggest hurdle, and it's a chicken and an egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Have you identified any other locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| No, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| We previously applied for tax credits on the old Flinnegan School site in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| and that site is still of interest to us, though we have no funding source for that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| Now, when we had our luncheon together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| you had mentioned that the practicality of possibly having this at the far reaches of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4810)|
| 1:20:18| whether it's out far in West Farragut or up north in Halls or out to Midway Road or all the way down Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4818)|
| 1:20:29| they didn't make it very practical to have them there because of the transportation issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| and the costs involved with that and you didn't have the services out necessarily in those outlying areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4835)|
| 1:20:45| So I guess my problem with supporting it, and I would like to support the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| but also, on the other hand, I don't want to hamstring the people that are trying to do good works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4852)|
| 1:21:05| And I'm not sure that I could support necessarily a two-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| I mean, once you go from one side of the circle to the other, you could be, I mean, you could be almost three miles apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4870)|
| 1:21:21| You literally could be four miles apart if you go from one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| The diameter would be four miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| So would one mile, I'm trying to compromise here, would a one-mile radius satisfy the commissioners in the second district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4887)|
| 1:21:41| Because if you take a look at, I guess this is the map that we're working off of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| if you're looking at the one-mile radius from West 5th and Broadway, you're past 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4908)|
| 1:22:00| You're out past Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4920)|
| 1:22:11| Like I said, our biggest concern in making it two miles was the future of St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| and what's going to go into that when they are no longer occupying that building because it's been floated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4936)|
| 1:22:24| that low-income housing would be great there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| And I can tell you that the people in Oakwood-Lincoln Park and Old North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| who have been investing a great deal of money in those neighborhoods and in those homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| that would bring down our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| That would increase the transients on our streets who knock on our doors at 2 o'clock in the morning and ask for money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| and who make us feel like we can't let our children play in the front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| Does the St. Mary's, doesn't that fall within the one mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Or is that outside of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| St. Mary's is about 1.7 miles out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| 1.7, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| So I guess you wouldn't want to amend it to one mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| No, unless we also included St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| You know, I'd be okay with one mile if we also included St. Mary's Hospital in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| Well, if you could do that, I could support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| I don't know that I can necessarily support it because I think once you start drawing two-mile circles, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=4998)|
| 1:23:26| in radius, which is four miles from one end to the other, I could find that within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5006)|
| 1:23:34| depending on how those are placed, I could see within about three of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5014)|
| 1:23:41| we're wanting to transport these folks probably further than to where the services are located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5021)|
| 1:23:50| that it becomes a bit impractical for these folks to try to help some of the least unfortunate people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5030)|
| 1:23:59| Well, that's called a concentration of services, and that's what we're trying to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| I guess, well, I'm talking about the services of what they would receive, not necessarily where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Well, hopefully, once they get into permanent supportive housing, they're not going to need to come in for a lot of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| I mean, the people like the most persistently mentally ill will probably go into Menville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| because they're going to need daily care for medications, for meals, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| Hopefully, a lot of these people will be able to transition out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| Well, I don't believe that that's what they're targeting because that was a question I asked at the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| I asked the question, how many of these folks in the other areas of the country that have tried this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| how many of these folks have transitioned out of this housing into something more independent living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5086)|
| 1:24:55| And what this targeted is not those that will transport or transfer into a more independent living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5095)|
| 1:25:04| So I'm just trying to be more practical about where we can start putting these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5104)|
| 1:25:14| We have the man promising that they're going to look at dispersing them as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| but within trying to locate these, finding something that's suitable, no matter where in the county first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5121)|
| 1:25:30| and then whether or not it works in Giddington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| Well, maybe we need to look at increasing our public transportation in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| That might be a good solution to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| I also think I understand where John's coming from, but you also have to understand the years that the neighborhoods have been dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5140)|
| 1:25:48| You need to have John answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| John, would you like to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| Commissioner Lutho, you make a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| And, again, I hate to be redundant for some of you because we've had individual conversations about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| But the individuals that are placed in permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| the profile of these individuals requires them to receive services during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| They will not receive those services at Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| They may go to Helen Ross McNabb and do outpatient services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| They may go to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Services will not be provided inside the apartment units themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| The case managers attached to each of these individuals will be facilitating the activity of getting them to the appropriate services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5187)|
| 1:26:35| so that they will remain stable and succeed in their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| It's a very important point to make that you can't just put one of these anywhere because you have to have available public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5200)|
| 1:26:48| so that they can get to the right service points in order to get the services needed so they can succeed in the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| So I appreciate you making that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| So I would love to support you on one hand, but I also want to make sure that this is a successful program on the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5218)|
| 1:27:05| and I'm trying to find a balance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Well, I'm okay with a one-mile radius as long as we also include St. Mary's, because that was the rationale for going two miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| was that we would include St. Mary's in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| So as long as St. Mary's is included, I'm okay with one mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| As long as we include St. Mary's within this program, is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| If you'll make that, then I can vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| So we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| I'm happy to reword as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| Reallocation of these funds, $250,000, is contingent on the recipient's agreement not to seek additional government funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| for other permanent supportive housing projects within a one-mile radius of Menville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| or on the former St. Mary's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| That I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Mr. Lawler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Just a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| We've already voted on, I believe, the $200,000 for Helen Ross McNabb to get there, or we're going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| How many units are we looking for in Knox County to, in the ten-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| I mean, we've still got, in the district that they're referring to, we still have no accountability in some of the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5290)|
| 1:28:20| As long as we have no accountability, our numbers are going to be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| And when are we going to start, number one, putting accountability on the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| and number two, how many units do you need in your ten-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| Two good questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| I'm glad to say that I do disagree with you on the accountability piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| The ten-year plan is built around accountability and defined results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| As of four weeks ago, CARM has opened a day shelter that we have created as the front door for every individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5323)|
| 1:28:51| that's moving from homelessness towards housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Every organization, Salvation Army, VMC, Helen Ross McNabb, has a role in having an individual referred to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5336)|
| 1:29:05| to keep moving them towards housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| We will, now that the continuum of moving people to housing has been set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| we will work to continue to define what accountability looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| But the ten-year plan, the reason we're excited about it, it's built around accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| and it's built against the tendency we've had in the past to allow people to stay in their homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5365)|
| 1:29:33| So accountability is core to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| Yeah, but how many units are you wanting to try to get in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| That was your second question, and it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| We think right now there are 600 to 800 chronically homeless individuals in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| Again, these are the individuals who are disabled, who have been homeless for more than a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| or had four significant bouts of homelessness over a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| These are very sick individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| There's 600 to 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| We think we'll develop 400 new permanent supportive housing units in conjunction with the ten-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| and then house the others in existing affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| What you say there's 600 to 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| Now, when you say disabled, are we talking about alcohol dependent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| What are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| Because being in law enforcement, I've seen a little bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| There's some that choose to be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| And if you feed the bears, they're going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| I completely agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| And so I think it's very important that, I mean, other counties ship their people to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5433)|
| 1:30:41| I know that for a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| And I think we need to stop making it so accessible to and inviting so that we can get the people that are really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5443)|
| 1:30:52| truly, chronically homeless off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| Now, until we stop feeding the bears, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| we're not going to be able to tackle the problem that the second district has at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| I completely agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| And the direction of the plan completely agrees with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| And our commitment is to, first of all, establish the principle that homelessness is not an acceptable condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| for anyone in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| And, secondly, every person that is in homelessness, if they have the ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| our expectation is they're moving out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| If they don't have that ability, that's why we have the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| and the case management approach of giving them assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| and giving them the path to get out of their homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| We are all about, if you have the ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| it is unacceptable for you to remain homeless in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| Mr. Andrews, those are good comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| I want to say this to the public and whatnot out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| You know, tonight Bill Williams is going to talk about children, wanting to adopt children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| And I think we as Knoxvilleans might want to look in the faith-based community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| might look at trying to adopt some of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| We don't even need to be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| Some of us would take it upon ourselves to adopt some of these adults and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| One thing that I was looking at, we're looking at this big circle here, and it is a big area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| And I understand, Commissioner Bores, what you're saying about your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| Would it be helpful if you all got together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| and you went through and told the communities that you wanted to stay away from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| the Forth and Gill areas and the St. Mary's, to try to, I mean, there's areas that you want to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| I'm just trying to find a medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| We already got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| We just felt like this was the most fair way to do it instead of signaling, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| Specific property, except for St. Mary's signaling, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Certain neighborhoods, just to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| We felt it was more fair to just do a whole circle rather than specifically saying this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| or that neighborhood because we're going to leave out a neighborhood that's going to, you know, object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| And this just seemed the most fair way to do it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| Ms. Bores, I think you've been more than fair with that two-mile limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| Now, Helen Ross McNabb is wanting to put one of these places on Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| He's talking about Flanagan School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| That's probably a mile as a crow flies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| They have looked in South Knoxville, moved from one location to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| It seems to me like the only people that are protected are the affluent people when it comes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| I'm not trying to start class action warfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| But I think, Mr. Lawler, you've been all over South Knoxville hunting places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| How far, how many places do you look at in Squalia Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| It's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| The very owner of the first property, we've looked at two properties in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| which was on the verge of being condemned by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| And then the owner closed it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| He also owns properties in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| And I couldn't even buy a parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| And so my efforts to buy something from him in Sequoia Hills were also futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| So we have approached him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| And I can assure you that we understand the power of locating one of these things in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5654)|
| 1:34:22| because everyone's assumption is your assumption, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| that they're going to go to these traditional areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| And our commitment is not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| So our development partner has got his eyes open for things that could work in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| You've moved from Parkway Hotel probably a half a block up to Flanagan School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| The Helen Ross McNabb Center moved from Colonial Village to Baker Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5681)|
| 1:34:48| It just seems to me like that if people are poor, you know they have no political clout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| and that's where you want to put these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| I'm going to stay with the two-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| I'm not saying we don't need this, these things, and I'm for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| But Commissioner Brad Anders told you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| They're sending people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| I notice that every time they interview some of these people on the street, they're not from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| but they say we've come to Knoxville because they know they'll help us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| We need to take care of our own and quit expanding it to other counties and other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| and that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| Now, if these people are arrested at these places, are they going to be put out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| Each individual will have a lease and they will be paying rent because being disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| they'll qualify for benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| So every lease will have criteria written into it of what you can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| It's going to be like any other apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| If you violate a law, I would guess the lease would say that you would end up being evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| But the landlord will determine that through the lease structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| Now, let me ask you another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| We're talking about transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| What are all these CAC buses and KCD buses doing running up and down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| Who do they deliver to these places for the services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| That is, those buses are a valid form of transportation, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| Why are we talking about public transportation then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| They could move 20 miles out in the country if you've got this transportation for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| Well, again, that transportation cannot be just at our disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| If we locate one of these 20 miles out of the community, it isn't designed to run there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| If the system was changed so it could be, that would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| And let me just say one thing to what Mr. Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| He talked about the faith-based community's role in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| An important component of the plan was to energize the faith-based community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| and get them involved in the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| We have set up a way that small groups from the faith-based community can be linked into relationships with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| that go into permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| So we see that as a long-term, very valuable strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| And I'm glad he brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| You're talking about working with your developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Who is the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| There's a nonprofit organization in town called Southeast Housing Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| It is a component of Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| David Arning, sitting right behind me, is their lead person from that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5838)|
| 1:37:25| Mr. Arning, what's the closest you have one of these places to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| We don't have one yet, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| I need your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| David Arning, 521 English Village Way, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| I would guess a couple of miles, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| But you won't go along with two miles then for everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| My concern with the two-mile radius is what Mr. Lawler mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| I think when we had conversations with Commissioners Harmon and Broyles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| the idea was to focus on the Fifth and Broadway area because of the services that are located there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| And we initially had talked, I think, about a wedge kind of area that addressed those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| And I think the two-mile circular radius is encompassing completely different neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| and areas and even some industrial areas that really don't necessarily affect residential neighborhoods at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5894)|
| 1:38:22| Mr. Lawler, how close do you have one to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| Well, again, what Mr. Arning said, we're in the beginning process of developing these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| There are Helen Ross McNabb did one four or five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| but we have as yet to do a permanent supportive housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| So I'd have to say that there are none close to me because we don't have one out there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5921)|
| 1:38:50| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| I'm hearing the term used, Commissioner Lutho used, the fact that these places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| these areas that, you know, Halls, Farragut, Powler is not, you know, just to call out a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| that somehow the people can't get services from those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| In 2008, we're talking about people not being able to get a van ride or some type of way to get down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5953)|
| 1:39:23| because I think also what I'm hearing you say is as long as Cherokee health services is located where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5963)|
| 1:39:30| and Helen Ross McNabb is located where it is, we're going to concentrate these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| I think the bottom line of what you said is that, is that as long as those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| those facilities that provide those services are where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| we're going to keep building facilities close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| And if that's not the case, then this shouldn't, this two miles shouldn't matter to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| It really shouldn't matter to you if that's not your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| I often hear you say, we're going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| We're going to, you know, we're going to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| You know, that and a quarter would get me a cup of coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| We need some hard answers from your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| We need to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| We will agree to this one because this isn't in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| This chronic homelessness is one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| We got KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| That's another piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| We got Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| That's another piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| We need to look at our community, okay, as a whole and say, where do we best put this new car that's coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6029)|
| 1:40:38| How do we best integrate this into our neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| So you all focus on one and Old North Knoxville or Dangers Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| We got one organization that's, oh, they're making a lot of noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| So we're going to have to appease them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| That shouldn't be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| We should be looking at Knox County as a community and planning from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6054)|
| 1:41:01| And to say that Farragut doesn't have the services or we can't put one in Farragut, we can't put one in Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6061)|
| 1:41:09| you know, then we're stuck in this two-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| So just come up to us and say, we're going to concentrate them right here for these reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6073)|
| 1:41:19| What's your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| And I think I've been real clear to say today just the opposite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| We are not going to concentrate these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| We're going to spread these out throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| I want to be real clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| There are developmental characteristics associated with this where we have to have adequate public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| because as Commissioner Leuthold said, these individuals need services provided in order to succeed in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6098)|
| 1:41:45| How about we find some money for VMC to get a couple of vans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| To say we can't get them to Cherokee, that can't be the reason for not siting a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| That can't be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| That just boggles my mind to say that, well, it's ten miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| We just can't get them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| We're talking about once or twice a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Helen Ross McNabb, I served on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| That's a great organization, great organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| But to say that for those twice a week visits that we can't get them from point A to point B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6135)|
| 1:42:23| so we just have to X out all of these areas, can't be the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6143)|
| 1:42:30| Again, if there's a will, there's a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| I mean, if there's enough money to acquire the vans and stuff, you can make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| Again, our commitment is I'm hearing what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| I'm not ignoring what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| What I want you to hear me say is our commitment is to spread these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| We don't do that in a way that guarantees them as great a likelihood of success as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| But I hear what you're saying, and our commitment is to spread them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| Commissioner Brove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| Then this shouldn't be a problem then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| This two-mile radius then should not be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| And I will take it on myself to get money somehow for VMC to have vans to do transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| I will take that on as my mission to help you guys with the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| But this is just, I'm sorry, but this, you know, I had a really good meeting this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| and now I'm hearing something totally different than what I understood this morning to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| So I'm sorry, but we're skeptical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| We are really skeptical because we've heard this kind of thing before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| and it's not being carried out the way that we have been told it was going to be carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| An oral commitment is worth the paper it's written on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| And that's what we're getting only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| We need better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| And honestly, Sam is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| There is a way to handle transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| There's a way to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| I appreciate your commitment in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| So we definitely will look forward to working with you on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| I mean, I believe in the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| I believe in what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| And one of the reasons, and I wanted the other commissioners to hear this, is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| one homeless person costs us $37,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| Once we get that homeless person into permanent supportive housing, that cost drops to about $12,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| Over the long haul, this is going to save us a tremendous, this is going to save our taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| of which I want lots and lots and lots of money every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| This is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| And I do believe that the ten-year plan is built on accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| I was talking to Jenny Weatherstone this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| It's 128 people since January 1st of 2007 to September 30th of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| and they have accountability built into their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| So I firmly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| And we are talking about, we talked this morning about maybe capping the number of shelter beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| to discourage people from coming from other cities and counties from sending us their homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| or them choosing to come here if they know that we only have a finite number of beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| they're less likely to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| So there's a lot of ways to attack this issue, and I want to look at all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| But this is really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| If you want our support, this is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6319)|
| 1:45:28| Are you through, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| I just wanted to say these are, you know, you don't think of an affluent community as a struggling community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| but the folks in the Forth and Gill area are struggling to carve out a community in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| And over the last decade or so, they've made a tremendous amount of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| I don't want to vote for anything that would threaten the progress there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| They took a neighborhood that people were running from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| People were running to the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| They were, you know, getting out of the inner city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| And these folks went back and said, we're going to rebuild the community here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6367)|
| 1:46:16| I don't want to do anything that would threaten the prosperity of those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| And so I plan on voting with the commissioners of the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| I think they were elected by the folks in those areas, and they know what's best for those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6385)|
| 1:46:33| And I just don't want to do anything that would cause these neighborhoods that are just a prime example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| of how you can turn a neighborhood around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| I don't want anything to happen that would make them fall back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| So I'm going to vote with the commissioners of the second district on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| And like Commissioner Pinkston, I think the two-mile radius is quite reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| Thank you, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| A couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Point number one, John, I'm very supportive of what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Having worked with Salvation Army, CARM, Volunteer Ministries, and so forth, there's a need here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| And what you're proposing, I think, is a good thing for the long-range needs of what we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6429)|
| 1:47:16| So I'm very supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| The second thing that I would like to mention is that I don't want to give anyone the impression that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| homeless people in West Knoxville, West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| If you pull off of Cedar Bluff Road, not so much now that it's getting colder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| but if you pull off Cedar Bluff Road or Lovell Road or Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| you will see a variety of homeless people who are there asking for money, going up to cars, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| I know we've gotten phone calls from the greenway behind Turkey Creek that people have started using that as a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| to, I guess, live until they can find something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| There is a wooded area across from Knoxville Catholic High School at the corner of Fox Lonas and Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| It's a wooded area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| We know that people have put tents up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| People live there during the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| As it's getting colder, they'll be moving downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| Also, there's a vacant home right there on Walker Springs, about a mile from where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| where we know homeless people have gone in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| And so they've created some issues with some of the neighbors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| So West Knoxville also has an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| And the notion that perhaps we couldn't put one of these facilities in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| I don't want to give that impression either because we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| And it could perhaps help some of the issues that we're having there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| I guess my third point is I like the idea of the two-mile radius, and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| Even though we were to pass that here today, let's say that you were to identify some property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| you would need to come back to us to modify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| I like that idea because then it would be upon you folks to go to the folks in that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| or wherever it would be located to present your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| And if you presented a good case and said, hey, this is viable property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| you've met with the homeowners and they agree, then you can come back to us and it can be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| And so I'm going to go along with the folks there in the 2nd District because I understand where you're coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| and the need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| I also understand their need and what they feel they need to protect their communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| and the integrity of their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| So I'm going to go along with the two-mile radius because I like the idea of if you do find something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| you would need to come back, talk with them, talk with the neighborhoods to get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6554)|
| 1:49:20| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| Mr. McKenzie, I don't think I said you can't put one of these in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| I just said that it did make the transportation costs would become greater and more difficult at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6568)|
| 1:49:37| Commissioner Hammond is correct in what he says, that there are homeless folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| in all parts of this county and services are needed throughout the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6582)|
| 1:49:50| Mr. Lawler there had said that at the luncheon that they preferred to have these closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6590)|
| 1:49:57| to where these folks would need the services, at least where those services are located at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6597)|
| 1:50:04| And that's all I was trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| And I hope I didn't make you think that we couldn't have one of these out in West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6607)|
| 1:50:15| because there very well could be a need for one in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| So, you know, I guess my question is are we still at the two-mile radius as far as what the amended resolution is right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6619)|
| 1:50:35| or did it go to the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| I didn't respond directly to Commissioner Pinkston, but I will in the affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| I believe, based on what we've heard of lack of responsiveness to a reasonable compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| that my resolution should read to amend the contract and resolution to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| reallocation of these funds, 250,000, is contingent upon the recipient's agreement not to seek additional government funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| for any other permanent supportive housing projects within a two-mile radius of MinnVilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| I just want to know what was on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| I just want to say one thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Commissioner Hammond, I know you have homeless people down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| We have them walking the streets in South Knoxville, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| But what we're talking about, there's nothing government subsidized down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| We all have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| We've got them all in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| I think the first district, I mean, the second district has probably more than anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| But these people, you answered one question, that he said, if they can get up here in the wintertime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6690)|
| 1:51:38| they can get up here for the services if there's one down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6698)|
| 1:51:47| Eric, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Eric Hoagland, Director of Community Development, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| I had just wanted to kind of point something out for clarity's purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6713)|
| 1:51:58| This contract is with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| So, which is going to enter a sub-recipient agreement with VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| So, whatever happens here today, we'll make sure that the city has with their sub-recipient agreement with VMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6726)|
| 1:52:17| whatever radius or whatever stipulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| But I just wanted to make sure that you all were aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Let's go for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| Just a quick point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| I thought Commissioner Harmon's amendment was a mile radius and the St. Mary's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| Are we back to two miles now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| We're back to two miles and not just the finger out to St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| We have a motion on the floor with an amendment to a mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| Do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Does that include the one that got deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| Helen asked me now if it got deferred, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| I couldn't remember if you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| No, that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| So this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Well, with the exception of those two that are already being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| So those two would go and then any further would be excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| The point that Mr. Hammond made that, you know, if they find a good location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| they can always come back to commission and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| And we're not saying that we wouldn't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| But I think that's a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Do you have something, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| I think we've taken a significant amount of time and we've not really talked about Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| I think I have a right to speak because I represent the highest concentration of people that are incarcerated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| And it's all on my shoulders because I'm the only commissioner in the 8th District, the senior commissioner to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| What I see us talking about is not about a good site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| We're not talking about Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| We're talking about taking the possibility of good sites inside a significant area off the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6848)|
| 1:54:19| and not being good sites going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| I think what we really need to be talking about is Menvilla, whether it's good or bad, vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| And next month, if they come with another site and it's across the street, it's either good or bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| and we vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| So I'm not in favor of taking any sites off the county map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6877)|
| 1:54:47| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Well, my response to that would be it would save everybody a lot of time and trouble if they just don't even look in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6889)|
| 1:54:57| So and as far as Menvilla goes, I support that as a historic restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6897)|
| 1:55:04| and I support that as a 57-unit permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| I think that's a good use of that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| and I think that that will be an important location for the people who are just not at all able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| people who still need daily intervention and care need to be within walking distance of VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6918)|
| 1:55:25| And I think that that's a good location, and I think that's an excellent use of these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6925)|
| 1:55:34| We have a motion on the floor with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| I think everyone's clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6942)|
| 1:55:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| And I have to ask once again if everyone would speak into the mics, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| Motion carries 15-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6964)|
| 1:56:16| 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| Approving a purchase agreement in the amount of $6 million with Hillcrest Healthcare Communities, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| for real property located at 5321 and 5325 Beverly Park Circle, 6801 Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6985)|
| 1:56:33| which includes 2820 Lake, it should be Lake Brook Boulevard, and 1758 Hillwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| Intergovernmental voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| Recommendation 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| Finance voted 9-1 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| I'm going to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7012)|
| 1:56:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| I would like to go over the terms of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| If someone could come to the microphone to discuss this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7028)|
| 1:57:31| Well, it looks like we've got a lot of folks to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| My first point is I received information that Hillcrest has provided $6 million worth of improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| to the Hillcrest facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Could you briefly explain what those $6 million in improvements were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| Yes, Carolyn Pointer, the president and CEO of Hillcrest, has those details for you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7066)|
| 1:57:55| Carolyn Pointer, 1978 Cherokee Bluff Drive, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| I'm the CEO at Hillcrest Healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| I have an itemized listing, a few copies of that, if you'd like to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| They range from everything from upgraded sprinkler systems, new roofs, compressors, doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7088)|
| 1:58:20| all in conjunction with regulatory fire building code issues, windows, a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7100)|
| 1:58:31| Commissioner, I'd be happy to provide you an itemized list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| I guess my question is I want to get an idea of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| But also, Knox County owns those facilities, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| The facilities and the properties, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| Why did you not come to Knox County and say, Knox County, we've got to make these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| You pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| Well, I've been in this job since last Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| So prior to that, I can't speak to unless my board member, Bill Mason, could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7132)|
| 1:58:59| Well, I think it's noble of you that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| It's my point is the fact that, you know, you actually saved us some money because you could have come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| and said, hey, we've got to make these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| And if they were deemed, you know, necessary or whatever, Knox County would have had to have paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| And the $6 million are records from the past eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| So prior to the eight years, there were additional improvements that I can't itemize for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| So, Bill, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| The sale price is $6 million, but it's owner financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| So the interest will also be coming to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| And the amount of that is 10 point, is it 10.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| 10.2, isn't that right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| 10.2 in payments back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| With the $6 million accounting for our improvements, that equates to the 16.2 appraised value from May of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7186)|
| 1:59:56| Why does Knox County not need, I guess, Mr. Arms, this would be for you or whomever would like to ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7196)|
| 2:00:03| Why does Knox County not need to be in the nursing home business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| Why are we asking Hillcrest just to, in other words, we're selling to Hillcrest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| Well, I think we were in the nursing home business 50 years ago by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| I think more and more it's good for government to ask why are we in certain businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| This is simply facilities we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| We do not have any say-so on who is on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| We do not have any say-so on who the board selects as a CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| We receive $1 a year in lease payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| So I guess the question we're asking is why are we in this business when they're actually the managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| and operator of the facility and all we have is basically a zero revenue stream and associated liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7244)|
| 2:00:55| And like I mentioned earlier, I think if there was ever a suit, and we certainly don't believe that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| We know that we have a good operator in Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| But if there was ever a severe injury or a fire-related death or something in one of these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| I think we all know who would end up being sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| Knox County would be on the end of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| So I think when we sit down with Hillcrest, we just looked at a win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| We know that historically Hillcrest has done an outstanding job in running this center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7283)|
| 2:01:30| They're serving a constituent of Knox County through this service that other nursing homes are not providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7290)|
| 2:01:39| I think we mentioned that they're in the 70 to 75% range of Medicaid patients versus, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7299)|
| 2:01:47| the state average is less than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| So they're serving a targeted audience that no one else is serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| And they had reached a point where simply when they went to the bank, the bank said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| how can we loan you money without any equity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| And I think what we've seen over the last 90 days in this U.S. economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| the banks would be asking that question much more seriously than they did in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| So by letting them own their own facility, it gives them leverage the next time they do need improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| So that's why when we sat down and when we talked, it just seemed like a win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7337)|
| 2:02:22| The $10.2 million, that money is going to go into our general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| It will go into whatever fund this commission wants it to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| I'm all for putting it in the bank, not earmark it for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| With that, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we approve the Hillcrest agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| Ms. Poynter or Mr. Mason, I'm asking basically the same question I asked Monday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| eight days ago or seven days ago about the why is this a good deal for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| Just looking at some of the numbers, and I read some of the, saw some of the inter-government meeting on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7378)|
| 2:03:07| If it's, and these are somewhat academic questions, but also real questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7387)|
| 2:03:12| If it's appraised at $16 million, why sell it for six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| That's what I've been asked by people, constituents and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| I know this is not as black and white as the State Street lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7399)|
| 2:03:26| which hopefully goes on the auction block tomorrow, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| if it were appraised at $16, we sure wouldn't be wanting to sell it for six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| I know there's subsidies involved here and liabilities and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| But just give me, if you could, your opinion on why, if it's appraised at $16, we should sell it for less than a third of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7416)|
| 2:03:45| Or about a little over a third of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| I think that the most important contribution that Hillcrest makes to this community is to serve a high percentage of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7428)|
| 2:03:56| Medicaid senior resident population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7436)|
| 2:04:02| It's a fact that the reimbursement rates for Medicaid by the government don't provide enough funds to operate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7442)|
| 2:04:15| program and we need a certain mix of Medicare and private pay patients at the facility to have a financially sound operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7455)|
| 2:04:30| In the negotiation to set the $6 million, that was the amount of money that we came to as an amount that we could pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7470)|
| 2:04:42| and continue to serve a significant portion of the Medicaid population within this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7482)|
| 2:04:52| So basically the difference in appraised value and what you would be paying over the term of the loan is the uncompensated care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7492)|
| 2:05:01| that Hillcrest would be giving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| To put a number to that, Commissioner Souse, the average nursing home in Tennessee serves about a 48% Medicaid population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7505)|
| 2:05:19| The amount of the Medicaid population that Hillcrest serves runs 70 or more percent historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7519)|
| 2:05:32| Taking account of the numbers for Medicare, private pay versus Medicaid reimbursements amounts to about a $9 million per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7532)|
| 2:05:44| difference in Hillcrest's operating revenue over what our operating revenue would be if we served the average number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7544)|
| 2:05:56| Medicaid seniors in our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| You receive federal and state money also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| Let me get Carolyn to help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| All of our revenue is fee billing to either Medicare, Medicaid, a commercial insurance, or a private account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7570)|
| 2:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| So some would come from for-profit insurance companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| and some would come from government agencies, be they federal or state or whatever, Medicaid, Medicare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| We average about a 3% to 5% commercial insurance population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| The rest is Medicare, Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| And generally, our private pay resident is the one who's paying cash assets, is paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7595)|
| 2:06:41| spending down their assets to become a Medicaid resident, which generally happens within 18 to 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7601)|
| 2:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| So you said no more than 5% comes from private insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| Currently, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| Would this facility go on the tax roll if title was transferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| It would stay a non-tax-paying revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| Bill, could I get your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| My name is William Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| My address is 3560 Tlahee Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| Yes, Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| You keep talking about the county being sued because we own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| We own the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| Own the buildings and the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7646)|
| 2:07:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| And I'm saying that's one liability we want to rid ourselves of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| That wasn't the reason we approached them for a sort of mutual approach about the selling of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7652)|
| 2:07:39| You approached them about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| We did approach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| Now, the $300,000 is maximum we can be sued for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| Is that not correct by state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| I'm just going to ask our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| On each case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| What's the maximum amount we could be sued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| Well, Knox County is subject to limitation under the Governmental Tort Liability Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| The maximum is $300,000 per event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| Per event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| So what you're saying, in other words, is we need to get rid of this because we're liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| No, I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| We need to get rid of our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| Maybe we need to get rid of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| We're responsible for all of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| The same thing could happen in these parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| It could happen out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| Someone could get killed or seriously injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| I don't look at that as a legitimate excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| Could I make one point, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| I think we're historically and our citizens expect us to operate a school system and libraries and parks and now senior centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7718)|
| 2:08:47| I don't think that's something traditionally counties operate, nursing home or nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| And when we sat down with Hillcrest, basically this was a financial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7733)|
| 2:08:59| Hillcrest is faced just like anyone else with needing more capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| and needing ongoing maintenance of a building that they're having trouble finding the money to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7744)|
| 2:09:11| And like I said, when they went to the bank, the bank was saying, where is your equity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| Why are we loaning you money to upgrade a building that you don't even own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| So this was basically a win-win for Hillcrest and Knox County, we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| because as we said, Hillcrest is serving a constituent need that no one else in the nursing home industry is serving in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7765)|
| 2:09:36| You know, it says right here, Hillcrest Medical Nursing Institute is a non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| non-stock Tennessee corporation chartered for the purpose of operating a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7781)|
| 2:09:47| It is operated under the direction of a licensed administrator and is governed by a board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| Capital outlay funds are furnished by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| Land and buildings are owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| Now, the reason we entered this agreement was to take care of the indigent care people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7799)|
| 2:10:06| Now, they're going to cut back on these Medicaid and Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| That's going to put a bigger burden on us taking care of these people than it is funding this out here without rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7809)|
| 2:10:16| They're a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| If they need money, they can come up here and ask for it, and we give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| We need to look at the burden of Knox County to help the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| Now, I think that these seniors out here where we have a lot of them that are drawing maybe $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7824)|
| 2:10:31| $1,100 a month social security, their pension is gone if they had a $300 or $400 pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| if it was invested in the stock market, that's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| I think we need to take care of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| They've worked and paid their taxes all their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| They haven't been a drain on Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| But yet, by Hillcrest's own admission, they're going to cut back on these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7846)|
| 2:10:53| I believe they're going to build cottages out there, houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| That's going to be for the rich people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| These people need to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| It's never demanded anything off of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| Plus, it's going to put a bigger burden on our health department than what it would be if they stayed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7864)|
| 2:11:10| Now, I don't understand why, them being a non-profit, that they did not come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7870)|
| 2:11:17| and ask for any money when we have our budgets if they're in such dire need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| You're talking about the $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| That's spread out over 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| Starts out 1% interest for the first year, two, three, and it ends up at $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7888)|
| 2:11:36| Now, this $6 million, I think Knox County ends up spending about $2.5 million a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7896)|
| 2:11:43| roughly, when you figure our budget is $641 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| That's no operating money at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| We can be putting a much bigger drain on the taxpayer by getting out of this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| I find it very funny that Knox County approached them about buying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| and if they're in such dire financial straits, why they didn't come and ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| I just don't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| Another thing, Mr. Law Director, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| Can we sell that property without taking bids on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7931)|
| 2:12:18| The property, the way the resolution is drafted, is to declare this surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7938)|
| 2:12:25| And I think under the language of the contract and the resolution is drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7945)|
| 2:12:32| if it's approved by this body, it can be sold without taking bids on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| because of the nature of the action that will be taken by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| saying that this particular property, because of its use, is declared in conformity with the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7962)|
| 2:12:52| impractical to take bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| Well, you know, I looked at this contract here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| There's no safeguards in it whatsoever for Knox County or the Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7978)|
| 2:13:06| We give them a building here and grounds that are worth $16 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7986)|
| 2:13:12| which I believe is worth quite a bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| That's the property assessor's appraisal, and I believe it's worth quite a bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=7994)|
| 2:13:21| I don't know why I'd like to see the itemized statement on these upgrades, but, you know, for 47 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| $6 million isn't a whole lot to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| For 47 years, a dollar a year, that's $47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| Mr. Anders, thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| There's no safeguards in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| If we sell it to these people, there's nothing to take care of our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| They can turn around and sell this tomorrow if they want to surrender their charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8028)|
| 2:13:54| and this could go to somebody could come right in and pick up a $10 million deal, equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8034)|
| 2:14:02| that the taxpayers just rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| Another thing is we're talking about putting this money in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| If you figured out, forget the first four years of just the interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| you're talking about $300,000 a year with all it would be for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| That's one-third of a penny on the tax rolls, one-third of a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8057)|
| 2:14:23| We'd be better off, I don't believe in raising taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| but we'd be better off raising the taxes and let them come up and ask for money for us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8065)|
| 2:14:30| They can turn around and sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| Another thing is, you holler, we've got the first mortgage on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| Whoever has the second mortgage has the right to pay off, to protect their interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| to pay off the first mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| They can go to the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| They could borrow $10 million on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| That makes that piece of property out there, do the investment on it, makes it worth $26 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| They could forfeit on it and somebody come up and pick up a $26 million piece of property for $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8093)|
| 2:15:01| There's no safeguards in here, what, forever, for the taxpayers, nothing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| You're going to be putting a burden on the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| There's just --I don't understand why we approached them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| It hasn't cost us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| But you're on a mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| They've done these last eight years of upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| It hasn't come from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| It saved the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| There's no way about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| Mr. Poynter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| Could I address one thing, Mr. Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| Yeah, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| Actually, it was a joint meeting where Hillcrest said, we've got more capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8132)|
| 2:15:39| There's ways, you know, they were talking to Knox County in terms of, can you help us financially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| And that's when we said, well, one way, because they presented the case, every time we go to the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| we can't get a loan, we don't own our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| And that's when we come up with this scenario of selling the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| You know, for instance, right now, they need a new water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| They need a new water tower immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| That's over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| And we've looked at several engineering estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| As a matter of fact, we applied for an ARC grant that would only cover a small portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| But I think they have capital upgrades just like any other health facility on an ongoing basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| just like I think it was three years ago the state passed a law about sprinkler systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| So I guess what we were thinking, they are constantly faced with new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| ongoing capital and maintenance, capital upgrades and maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| And basically, if they were doing those on their own nickel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| it would cost eventually more money for the constituents they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| So it wasn't us calling up the phone and picking up the phone and saying, do you want to buy Hillcrest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8204)|
| 2:16:51| It was Hillcrest sitting down with us saying, we want you to know the dilemma we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8211)|
| 2:16:56| We're faced with more needs for capital upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| As a matter of fact, they asked us if we would give them over a million dollars to buy a new water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8219)|
| 2:17:07| And the irony of it is there's several nonprofits that have come to Knox County recently saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| will you take over our facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| We're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| Will you take over our buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| So I think and some of our nonprofit museums and homes who are saying we can't financially afford the capital upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8238)|
| 2:17:28| we will basically give you our buildings if you will take them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| Museums, did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| Nonprofit entities that run museums and houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| You think that's more important than taking care of our elderly people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| No, I'm giving you that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| In a museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| Everywhere our nonprofits are in today's economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| every one of our nonprofits are stretched thin on operating costs and have little or no money for capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8270)|
| 2:17:58| Now, I think taking care of Hillcrest is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| And one reason I think we go into this with good faith, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| there's board members like Bill Mason who does every bit of this work absolutely free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| He's here as a citizen supporting our cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| When you're dealing with people like that day in and day out who put their heart and soul into a board of directorship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| for a good cause, we feel like we can trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| A lot of this is a trust relationship, and I think later on you may address some ways to codify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8304)|
| 2:18:30| or permanently make the long-term agreement on how they'll manage this facility and put it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8310)|
| 2:18:37| I think that might be a very smart thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| But I can tell you this, working with this board of directors, we feel a high level of trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| and confidence because they're there as citizen volunteers giving a lot of their time trying to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8324)|
| 2:18:50| Who appoints these board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8330)|
| 2:18:56| The Hillcrest Board elects its successors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| Did not the county commission used to have to approve them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| Not during my time, but I don't know the history of that commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| Did the grand jury used to check these facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| Sorry, I don't know the answer to that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| Does anyone here know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| Beg your pardon, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| When did Knox County ever operate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| It was established in 1961.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| And that's the only thing Knox County did was buy the property and build the buildings for them, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8375)|
| 2:19:41| Knox County was given the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| It was, but we built the buildings on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| We've never run the facility Knox County had, according to what I just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| And this is Hillcrest information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| Name and address, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| What I wanted to address briefly was under the Not-for-Profit Corporation Act of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8400)|
| 2:20:07| under which Hillcrest is chartered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| before they can transfer property not in the ordinary course of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| dissolve with real property, or merge with a for-profit corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| they have to give notice to the attorney general of the state and the local attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| who represents the interests of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| And he intervened, can intervene, and does intervene regularly in proceedings involving not-for-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8429)|
| 2:20:37| where there are allegations that property is being transferred without proper consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| There have been several very significant cases lately over in Middle Tennessee involving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8443)|
| 2:20:50| are you familiar with that one, some property at Fisk University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| There is also a foundation that has alleged the property should go to Mississippi and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8456)|
| 2:21:03| But there are adequate protections under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| Mr. Lockett and I have discussed, if you all want some sort of deed restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8466)|
| 2:21:13| that this property is not to be conveyed to somebody for $10 million who is a for-profit corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8473)|
| 2:21:21| which it could not be anyway under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| I think we could work some language out like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8484)|
| 2:21:31| Of course, subject to the pleasure of the commission, if they decide that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| That was something you and I talked about before the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| I think the issue we discussed went to that subject and perhaps also language that would include that a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8498)|
| 2:21:52| the mission of Hillcrest would continue in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| and that is that it would serve the indigent community in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| and that the charges for services would somehow reflect the same thing on an ongoing basis as has been charged in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8523)|
| 2:22:16| I think what Commissioner Pinkston, and this is a valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| and I'm not quarreling with his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| I'll go ahead, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| I like to quarrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| Is that you all don't sell this property to Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| and then they turn around and sell it to somebody who's not in the mission of providing health care services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| or nursing home services to the poor part of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8556)|
| 2:22:43| And we agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| And we are more than willing, I think I'm speaking on behalf of the board and the director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| more than willing to work with Knox County on a way that we can allay those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| I just want to point out your first line of defense is the state not-for-profit corporation act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8577)|
| 2:23:05| and the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| But there are certainly other ways to protect Knox County's interest and the concerns that have been expressed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8586)|
| 2:23:13| We're happy to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| But this commission has no way to protect them, Arthur, is what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| What I'm concerned about, I talked to Ms. Poynter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| I'm concerned, and you have to realize the reason they leased this building so cheap was to take care of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| that need health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8608)|
| 2:23:31| I've asked her, she said 70 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| I've asked them if they would go with 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| I haven't gotten a reply back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| She said the board would be here today to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| Let me see if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| I'm trying to give a little here, but I've got to take care of the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8624)|
| 2:23:48| And I agree with you on what your duty is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| And let Ms. Poynter, she has discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| Yes, I'm happy to speak to that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| We have served and today are serving 70 percent of our residents today are Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8639)|
| 2:24:09| I have a new report based on 2008 data from the American Health Care Association that says nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8649)|
| 2:24:18| nursing homes are being reimbursed 93 percent for every dollar of actual allowable costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8658)|
| 2:24:25| Obviously, with that math, I can't do 100 percent Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| I won't be in business, nor any of your Medicades won't be taken care of in that scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| That's the unfortunate truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| To the point about me setting charges, we do not set our charges for Medicaid or for Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| For Medicaid, our charges, our reimbursement is based on last year's cost report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| handed down 15 months from now after a lot of analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| My rates are set 15 months in retrospect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| And generally, I lose money on every Medicaid I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| Therefore, and I'm certain Dr. Briggs could speak to this from the health care world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| everyone is charged with managing a case mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| Our commitment is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| We will, and we have said in writing, we will, and our board has authorized, Commissioner Pinkston, for me to say to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8716)|
| 2:25:23| we will take care of the highest level of Medicaid folks that we absolutely can and stay in viable business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8723)|
| 2:25:33| And that's my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| To lock into 62 percent if my Medicaid reimbursement changed drastically over the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8735)|
| 2:25:42| because I think that the last proposal you gave me was 62 percent for the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| which, frankly, if reimbursement rates stay the same, I could live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| I just don't know, nor will I know, until 15 months after the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| and then they're made retroactively effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| Well, in no way at all have we asked you to regulate your charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8761)|
| 2:26:05| That's none of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| I was addressing Mr. Lockett's point about us setting charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| And we don't set our charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| That's my point on the Medicaid and Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| It's all handed to us based on historical cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8776)|
| 2:26:21| So we don't just pick a number and start charging a new number every fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| But you gave us a figure here of what these other nursing homes charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| They're at 93 percent or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| What was it you said about other nursing homes, the way they operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| The state average, according to the Tennessee Association for Homes and Services for the Aged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| the state trade organization, 48 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| The average nursing home in Tennessee serves 48 percent Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| How many of those are paid for profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| I don't know the specific answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| There are very few not-for-profit corporations in the nursing home business in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8816)|
| 2:27:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| So these others are making a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| We're not up here to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| We want to serve the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| It's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| And I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| But I can't do it if I can't at least meet my operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| Well, but it looks, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| But the very first article I read in the paper, you're cutting back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| You're building these assisted living places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| And that sounds like it's for the rich people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| Well, it does sound like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| And there are some companies across the nation who have chosen to focus on the private pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| I can give you an example that in a recent proposal to the Bureau of TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| in line with available grant money through the new Long-Term Care Community Choices Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8862)|
| 2:27:49| we put a proposal in to build the first Medicaid greenhouse that we would love to operate if we could obtain land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8869)|
| 2:27:57| and money to build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| So we have proposed to the Bureau of TennCare that we do need to take care of the Medicaid population in the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8880)|
| 2:28:07| with the same equal services as our private pay folks deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| We are trying to get into more of a private room model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| We are trying to do things, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| or to be able to give equivalent dignity and opportunity to the Medicaid people that our private pay folks get in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8898)|
| 2:28:28| facilities currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| That's what the Long-Term Care Community Choices Act is about that we have supported from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8910)|
| 2:28:35| Some of our not-for-profit counterpart, I mean our for-profit counterparts, opposed that legislation initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| And we've been on board with that because we do believe this population deserves the same type of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| the same choice of health care service in long-term care as every private pay member or commercial insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8926)|
| 2:28:53| Ms. Poynter, I don't want you to think I'm trying to be hard on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| I talk loud and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| I stress my points pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| At your Monday and Finance Committee meeting, I was told that the terms on this, the 35 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8942)|
| 2:29:12| that was the only way you could afford to pay for it, the $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| The interest, as low as it was, it had to be that low for you to make the only way you could pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8957)|
| 2:29:26| How are you going to go out and borrow money and pay that debt back if you don't put these other people out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8966)|
| 2:29:36| and start bringing citizens in and charging them more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8976)|
| 2:29:39| Would you explain that to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| I'm not very good in math, but I don't know how you can do without putting them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8980)|
| 2:29:46| and having somebody in there pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| Let me say that we do not have an immediate plan to borrow money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| We have applied for grant money through the Bureau of TennCare for long-term care reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8991)|
| 2:29:56| We have applied for some local foundation grants to try to help us supplement what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=8996)|
| 2:30:04| We have been very astutely managing our expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| trying to make sure that we do not take away from the frontline caregiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| We have streamlined many administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| We have tried to do a number of things, Commissioner Pinkston, to not have to go borrow money right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| The reality is if we do want to make improvements, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9022)|
| 2:30:27| converting every or certain rooms at Hillcrest South, for example, to private rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9027)|
| 2:30:34| to more of a suite environment as an example, which is what I think you and I, any of us around the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| if we end up going to a nursing home, that's what we're going to want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| That's what we're going to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| Rather than a roommate who you don't know that's forced upon you, a shower room down the hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9044)|
| 2:30:52| the institutional setting that we currently have, unfortunately, has been that way in long-term care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| To be able to drive away from that, that will require some renovations to these existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| The only way to do that is either a private capital campaign, which would obviously be our first choice, or to borrow money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9065)|
| 2:31:12| It's not on the docket today, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| We're trying to stabilize and do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| and make sure that our cash flow is strong at this point in time, and that's our first priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9077)|
| 2:31:23| The others will come later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| To tell you the truth, we haven't been able to do a long-range plan because we have had nothing on which to base it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9084)|
| 2:31:31| Did you apply for a grant for the million-dollar water tower you need immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| The mayor's office helped do that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9098)|
| 2:31:39| Then you may get that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9099)|
| 2:31:40| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| There would be no reason to sell it to you because you need that money, darn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| What I am actually concerned about is the way we are going to be treating some of our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9105)|
| 2:31:52| that have sacrificed all their life for health to help other people out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9112)|
| 2:31:58| and now they're going to be out in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| Here we are talking about building homes for the homeless, and there's a lot of good homeless people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9120)|
| 2:32:08| I could become homeless tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9128)|
| 2:32:09| Anybody could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| A lot of these people are coming in from out of state, and we're going to spend money to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| but yet we're going to throw our good, honest citizens out where they don't have anything here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9135)|
| 2:32:22| We're not throwing anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| You're not going to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| That's the same as throwing them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9146)|
| 2:32:27| And remember the other comment I made to you earlier was I have about 40 empty beds today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| If I had 40 Medicaid referrals today, I'd take all 40 of them because a Medicaid patient in my bed is more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9152)|
| 2:32:39| than zero patient in my bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| I'd be happy to take 40 of those patients today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| The referrals aren't there today or they would be full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| We're at 90 percent occupancy today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| So to your point, I'm not throwing anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| We've committed to not throw anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| But we do have to stay in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| Well, I just think it's our duty to protect the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| and Lord knows I'm against taxes, but I'd rather help you a little bit is turn this over to you completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9183)|
| 2:33:11| because I don't see any way in the world you can pay for what you're telling me without putting the good people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9191)|
| 2:33:17| And it doesn't make any sense for me, and you know yourself, Knox County approached you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9197)|
| 2:33:24| approached Hillcrest, I'm talking about you, Hillcrest, about buying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9204)|
| 2:33:29| You didn't come to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| We're putting these people out, and it's worked good for 47 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| Why would we want to change it now and gamble on it not helping the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9216)|
| 2:33:42| It's not benefiting Knox County in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| We're giving up $10 million to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| We're going into the finance business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9228)|
| 2:33:50| John, step up here just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| Mr. Pinkston, we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| This is about this Hillcrest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| I've got the floor and I'll talk all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9237)|
| 2:34:00| Mr. Pinkston, Robert Rutherford, I can give you five minutes to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9240)|
| 2:34:08| Mr. Troyer, is this the first time Knox County has ever gone into the financial business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| The county has a few notes receivable outstanding for some utility districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9255)|
| 2:34:21| who did some utility improvements back in the 90s, I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| and the county was the mortgage holder for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9266)|
| 2:34:30| And continues to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| I believe they paid us for that when the state came through with the money, though, didn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| There's still some outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| There may be, but I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| And so it's a community purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| You know, from a financial perspective, one, the nursing home business is a community purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9281)|
| 2:34:45| We want to make sure that these people are served, continue to be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| They've made the pledge that everyone will continue to be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| If the commission takes no action, the county will receive a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9291)|
| 2:34:56| If the commission takes action, the county will receive $6 million plus $4 million interest over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9296)|
| 2:35:02| From a financial perspective, that's important and that helps the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| So I think it's a good proposal, and I would advocate that the county vote affirmatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9307)|
| 2:35:14| I'm going to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| I don't know how to help the county because we're not recognizing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| Mr. Chairman, you can have the floor back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Originally, I was all for this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| I'm a conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9328)|
| 2:35:30| I believe in privatization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| But with the points that have been brought up here today, I'm wavering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9333)|
| 2:35:40| You know, this is a great asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| These properties are a great asset, and they don't belong to me, and they don't belong to Mr. Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9342)|
| 2:35:48| and they don't belong to anybody in the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| They belong to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| We are about to experience a wave of retirees like this country has never seen before with the retirement of the baby boomers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9353)|
| 2:36:03| And there's a lot of working poor out there who haven't had the money to invest like my parents have invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9363)|
| 2:36:11| They haven't been able to buy property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| They haven't been able to buy stocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| And they don't have the money to pay for a private facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| And a county-owned facility with a county commission owning, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| having some leverage with a company like yours, a nonprofit like yours, has a lot of power to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9388)|
| 2:36:36| we want you to keep 60, 70 percent, you know, Medicare patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| Once we make this deal, I don't see that we have that leverage any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| And if you're not willing to give us in writing that you'll always accept at least 62 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9407)|
| 2:36:55| I think that was a reasonable number that Paul came up with, 62 percent that are Medicare patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9415)|
| 2:37:03| then I can't support this because right now the stockholders of this government, the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9423)|
| 2:37:12| there's a lot of them out there that are working poor that do not have the retirement to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9432)|
| 2:37:19| And I cannot, with a clear conscience, stand up here and sell their asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9439)|
| 2:37:25| the nursing homes that they own that belong to them, that's a place that they can go when they're in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9445)|
| 2:37:33| I can't have a clear conscience and sell those without some sort of a guarantee that those folks are going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9453)|
| 2:37:43| And I also believe that this is a bargain basement price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| and I'm willing to go along with the price if we can get some assurance that the working poor are going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9467)|
| 2:37:56| But without some sort of a guarantee, I don't intend to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9476)|
| 2:38:02| And I think that everyone should really pray hard before they vote to sell off the taxpayers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9482)|
| 2:38:10| one of the only places that the taxpayers that do not have private retirement funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9490)|
| 2:38:17| one of the only places that those folks can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| I'd like to address the commissioner's, some of the commissioner's points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| First of all, the county does not own the licenses for the beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| Hillcrest owns the licenses for the beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| The county is not allowed to be in the business of nursing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| Are we the landlords?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| We own the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| They own the license for the beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| And you don't think that gives us some leverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| Some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| And you'd like for us to sell that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| At a bargain basement price, because I've heard estimates that these properties may be as worth as much as $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| which, again, I'm all for, you know, selling them at the bargain basement price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| if we get a guarantee that our working poor will be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| Hillcrest has been in the business for many, many years and has shown a very, very strong service record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| If the county were to put a selling price at $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| then they would be much less able to provide those services for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| You would tie their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| I think this agreement will help the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| This agreement will help Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| And I think you should vote yes today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9568)|
| 2:39:31| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| I think Mr. Pinkston brings up some very valuable points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| I've got a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| Mine has more to do with the terms and the amount of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9583)|
| 2:39:50| And I'm looking here at the promissory note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9590)|
| 2:39:54| I was under the understanding that we were going to own or finance all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9594)|
| 2:39:59| but this here says that we're only going to amortize $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9599)|
| 2:40:04| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| Can someone talk to me about the terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| There are three pieces of property, one at the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9609)|
| 2:40:13| Okay, this may just be the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| So it's going to be 100 percent financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9618)|
| 2:40:19| So we're going to finance all $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| At one percent interest only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9622)|
| 2:40:24| One percent interest only the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| The first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9626)|
| 2:40:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9627)|
| 2:40:28| So that would be, we'll get $60,000 the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| Correct, $5,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| And then the second year goes up to two percent, so we'll receive a total of $120,000 and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9634)|
| 2:40:45| I don't have necessarily a problem with selling the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9645)|
| 2:40:52| I would like to try to have some built-in safeguards that Paul has alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9652)|
| 2:41:02| Mr. Law Director, is there a way we could put in some deed restrictions that say they have to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9662)|
| 2:41:15| take Medicare, Medicaid patients, not maybe necessarily a certain percent, but that it remain a non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9675)|
| 2:41:31| healthcare facility and that they are to maintain maybe a majority of their patients be Medicare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9691)|
| 2:41:46| We can, in conjunction with Hillcrest's attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9706)|
| 2:41:51| sit down and come up with language that would, I think, do what the sense of what I'm hearing is that Hillcrest has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9711)|
| 2:42:04| always served the indigent community in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| And they are telling us today that that's their mission and they want to continue in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9728)|
| 2:42:16| And I see that concerns have been expressed by commissioners that we not sell the property and then that abruptly change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9736)|
| 2:42:27| I think what we'll have to do, though, is in line with what was stated earlier, there are some hard economic realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9747)|
| 2:42:40| I think we all want, if I understand what's being said, want Hillcrest to continue operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9760)|
| 2:42:47| and be able to serve the indigent community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| But the only way they can do that is to continue operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| So I think the language, and again, is something that can be done to answer your question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9774)|
| 2:43:03| incorporate deed restrictions that would run with the land that would ensure that if this land is sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9783)|
| 2:43:17| that it will continue to be used for the purposes that it has been used for in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9797)|
| 2:43:24| Now, in terms of how to accomplish that, it's going to have to be structured in such a way that we would balance both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9804)|
| 2:43:36| concerns that I'm hearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| This commission's concern that as many of the patient population as possible be indigent patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9818)|
| 2:43:48| balanced against the business reality that they've got to be able to pay their operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9828)|
| 2:43:55| And so that's something that is not going to remain constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| It's subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| So the language would have to allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9841)|
