| 0:08:52| Chief Wolfie May, the gentleman that left, you talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Did he understand what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| So he knows to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| I told him that he would be receiving a letter in the mail, and I would be back to post the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I knew you had chatted, and I really wasn't sure where he was at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| He understood that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| We have a topic that we need to discuss and possibly bring back next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| and it's in reference to Okie Joe's Sports Bar at 226 Andrew Johnson Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=570)|
| 0:09:41| I passed out a flyer to each of you that came from the codes office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=581)|
| 0:09:51| and I guess we need to discuss what we're going to try to line up for next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| Can you give us a little bit of background of what may have occurred that brought this to your attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| I guess it would be best to probably hear from the codes department on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| I can speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| And the fireman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=613)|
| 0:10:26| On November 26th, there was a fire at this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| The situation was there was an apartment upstairs, which was not supposed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| That was a stipulation for their certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| Someone had been staying up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| A heater they had going in this apartment caught a basket of clothes on fire, and that's where it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=645)|
| 0:10:54| Following up on the incident, they have constructed a deck, a substantial-sized deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=654)|
| 0:11:02| It's as large or larger than the bar itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Out the back, the rear exit door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| When you step through the rear exit door, you're on this deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| and it goes to a gate that is chained and padlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| And this is a solid wood gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| You know, it's not this high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| It's this high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| We have revoked our CLC and sent it to codes office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| Codes has revoked their certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| At this point, they cannot legally occupy that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| And they did build the deck without a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| In fact, they did it right after our inspection and the approval for their beer license back in July or June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| I think it was, I don't have the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| It was approved, but it was towards the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| Right after that, they started construction and did it without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| Mr. Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Have you all followed up to make sure nobody's occupying the building since you've written the revoked OCO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| I believe they are occupying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| They are occupying it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| What is your remedy for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Well, our remedy is we can go up and cite them to court, which would be probably a $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=741)|
| 0:12:30| I think taking the beer permit would probably be an easier remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| Mr. Law Director, can we suspend their beer permit pending them appearing before us next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=756)|
| 0:12:45| I think they have a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| They don't have a right to not have a CO and a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| Right, but they have a right to due process before we revoke or suspend their license under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| So you could schedule them to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| How can they occupy, sell beer without a CO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| They can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| So why can't we suspend their license and require them to appear to get it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| Because the law says failure to comply with any of the above causes, which is a CO, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| that they are to appear before you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| and show cause why they shouldn't have a suspension or revocation and why they should not be fined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| which implies that in the reality they have due process before you can suspend, revoke, or fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=808)|
| 0:13:39| And if they don't have a CO, nobody should be in the building, so even with a license they can't sell anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| I understand it's a catch-22, but I have to advise you what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| They have a right to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| I think what your statement would be, the fire marshal could take care of that legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| You all could notice them and bring them in the next day, next beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| and make them show cause as to why you should not do one of the following things in accordance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=841)|
| 0:14:09| I would, Travis, if you don't mind, go out, and if they are occupying the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| and obviously I'm not your boss, but I would like for you to go out and check that as soon as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| and if they are occupying the building, write them a citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| and also I'd like to call them before and padlock it if it's within the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| and also have the commissioner or the chair send them a letter telling them to appear before the next beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| to face a suspension or revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=876)|
| 0:14:44| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Did this deck they added on, did it substantially increase their occupancy by more than half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| It's doubled the occupant load of the facility, not the building, but the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| and the conundrum with that is the rear exit from the bar, it is a required exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| The occupant load is over 50, so the doors are required to swing out with panic hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| So the deck outside is going to have an occupant load in excess of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| They're required to have two exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| There's only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| They can't go back through the bar because the door can't swing both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| There's a panic device on both sides of the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| So there's a, I don't know how they're going to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| It seems to me with that substantial amount of increase of occupancy that it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| I don't see why we cannot close them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| They're breaking the law or endangering people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| I mean, it's not like they added on 10 seats out back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| I agree with you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| My understanding, though, they have no certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| They cannot be occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| So they shouldn't be in the building anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| and I believe if they have the jurisdiction to remove them from the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| or assign them to be removed, and then that would fall under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| is it in the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| It's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| It's one of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| It would be J.J. to try to enforce the occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| Coach could also deal with a CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| I mean, we have remedies to get them out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| I'm just speaking to the beer permit as to the process we have to do for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| and they really shouldn't have people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| They probably have no insurance to cover them under that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| I mean, it's a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| They can't have insurance with no CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| So that's a bad situation if they have people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Are they trying to do business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Are they operating business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| They are doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| I can only advise you what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| I'm not going to tell you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Chief, are you able to go down and if they don't have a CO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| can you pull their beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Is that a violation of policy at all or any law that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Travis, if you'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| I think that on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| If you can pull the microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| I think on my part, if you suspend the license, I can go and pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| But I don't think I can pull it on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| I'd like to go back and ask Travis to go to the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| if they are occupying this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| And I'd also like for the chairman to send them a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| and ask them to come before beer board to face revocation or suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| And if they don't have a CO, I think we take it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| John, do you want to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Mr. Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| So based on all the testimony, we could not, as the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| suspend their license when they violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| When they got their license, they knew what the parameters were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| and they've now done things that are not in conjunction with that license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| But, you know, if something happens in the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| and there are citizens that get injured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| this is not going to be a good thing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| Well, Commissioner, that would be true if we were a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| but this is a judicial board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| And it has to be properly brought before under the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| they have a right to due process, to tell their side of the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| to provide a defense for you all to rule, to take a property right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| which is their license, away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| And unfortunately, unless you all want to have a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| for that one case or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| the remedy would be for them to get them out of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| under some other legal action rather than this beer board is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| The beer board is stuck with either a license or no license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| and it requires due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Can he padlock the place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Can he padlock the business since they're in violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| My fire marshal knows more about that than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| I'm not sure how far he can go in codes on occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| They'd have to address that a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| I'm not sure how far you can go other than citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| I know for taxes we can padlock, but I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| I believe Codes Department can make it inhabitable and lock it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| Is this something that we could change by ordinance to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| if you lose your certificate of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| you immediately have to suspend, give us the authority to suspend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| I think it's a state statute that requires the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| No, this is a, yeah, you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| This is your own ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| It's your ordinance that requires you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| Look at subsection P, Poppins, above Q, where you've highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| It doesn't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| A violation of the law has occurred on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| I guess below it says it requires the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| All of these things above requires due process is what it's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| I wish it said what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| If there's no way to lock this thing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I don't mind coming back for a special meeting before New Year's Eve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| because that's where their problems are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| I hate to call a beer board meeting for that alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| but there's going to be issues there on New Year's Eve if they're not able to lock it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| I think Codes should be able to lock that building up, because it's not inhabitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| Commissioner Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Two things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| I was reading that to where you have to have that due process to take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| Now, if we call and say you need to appear here next beer board meeting and they don't show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| can we take action then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Number two, if they can lock the doors out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| can they not put something up across the entrance's way since it's not inhabitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| say this building is not to be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| And if they tear the tape down or whatever you want to put up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| can that be kind of policed by the Sheriff's Department to make sure that they're not in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| just to drive by to show that it has been put up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| And is that applicable in this instance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| If you give them an opportunity for due process and they fail to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| they have waived their due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| and you all can act because they failed to demonstrate why it shouldn't be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| As to tearing down tape and all that, that will probably fall under 39| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| and be probably criminal trespass or something along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| But you could have it up there where you don't have to get out of the car and look in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| You show that it has been put up there and it has not been crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| That would be up to people like the officer there to look and decide how they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| it's their discretion as to what they would want to do under that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Can we be made aware of what process, what they do when they go out there for codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| so that if we do need to see that we need to come back before New Year's Eve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| Can you ask that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Yeah, I just want to make sure that if for some reason codes goes out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| and it does not close the building down, that we be made aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| So maybe if we need to take some other action before New Year's Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| I mean, beer is what's, that's the enticement to get everybody to come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| If they weren't selling it, there's not going to be anybody there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| So I'd just like to be informed as to how the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| how it's going when codes does go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Sandra, can I let you know when you get out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Let the chairman know and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| If you do a special call meeting, is that under the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| is there a required time amount that must be met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| Ten days, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| And if we're talking ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| It'd have to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| It'd have to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| And I don't know if you would have enough time if we're talking ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Is it ten days on a special call meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Because it's ten days on a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Or is it 72 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| That's my question of making sure that they are aware of what that due process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| The worst case under commission rules would be five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| A special call meeting, I think, is 42 hours if it's an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| That's because you call this an emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| It would be up to the discretion of your chairman here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| I would leave it to the codes and the fire marshal as to what remedies you ended up being able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| And then I would recommend that you then notify the chairman as to the effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| And this board can give him the discretion to call a special call meeting with 48 hours notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| But the problem is you've got to have, depends when it is, you need three days for the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| And so you're looking at five days any way you cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| What if it's an emergency meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| You still have to give adequate notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| And generally it's in a paper of general circulation, which the new Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| if you call them today, it will be day after tomorrow before they put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Then you have 48 hours after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| So you're into a four- to five-day swing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| I'm just saying logics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| But the other thing is, you know, you can be, the only thing is if there's any violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| they could contest in court, overrule your decision, and you'd have to rehear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| What if we call a meeting and then we can cancel it at the last moment if we want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| We go ahead and set a meeting up and we do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And if we need to cancel, we cancel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| How many of you are out of town between New Year's and Christmas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| I'm in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| I think people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| You may not even have a quorum between now and Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Well, that's what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| That automatically would cancel the meeting if I can't get a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| I'd come in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| There's like four right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Who's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| I'll leave on Friday, but I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| It's Friday the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| To me, it's day to day whether I'm here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| We're all that way, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Physically or mentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1564)|
| 0:26:14| I think we should leave it up to these guys to see what they can do to shut the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| If you can get the doors shut, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| If you can't, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| And we'll try to take some kind of action as fast as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| because I don't like the liability side of this with us having knowledge that there's this violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| and citizens out there that may be subject to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| I think that's something that we need to really be on top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| and do something about as fast as we can if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1597)|
| 0:26:47| So would the motion be to look at the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| We're not going to need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| So would the motion be reflective of codes first to look at their due process through codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1615)|
| 0:27:05| Or are we looking at a motion period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| That's what I'm a little unsure on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| If you wanted to take an action in alignment with Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| you are on notice that there is a legal violation testified before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| You can call a special call meeting for a given date that can meet the criteria probably by Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| and give them notice to be here on that date, time, place, certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| And even if you wanted to have Chief May deliver the notice to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| to be ensured that they are properly served and the proper time to appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| giving them adequate time to appear and put together their case as to why their license should not be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| So that's entirely possible for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| This board could set it up where it could happen sometime next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| It's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| But if you want to give the departments an opportunity to close it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| that is separate and apart from what this board does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| When was it that you first went out and discovered that this was all going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1706)|
| 0:28:34| The 27th was on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Monday is when we followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Can you use your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| The 27th was on a Friday, I believe, and we followed up the following Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| Of November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| And so nothing else as far as you've been back out there, so nobody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| They had been served with a notice, yes, a violation notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| And you didn't hear anything from them or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| When were they served with the notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1742)|
| 0:29:11| I don't have that file with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| It was later that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| It was the following week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| So the first week of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| It wasn't the Monday when we went because we went back out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| and I want to say it was probably Wednesday or Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| So has anybody been back by to see if they are still operating and open today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| Not today, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| When was the last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| They were operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| When you went to that first part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Was that hand delivered to them or posted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| So they're very much aware of it, and they've not contacted you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| They talked to me that first day, and I spoke with the owner on the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| and I went up Monday with a site visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| No one was on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| We didn't get to speak with anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| That's why we went back with the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| But we did leave a note on the door for them to call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| and I spoke with them and told them they needed to acquire a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| and that they were in violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| and that they were not supposed to be occupying the upstairs lot of the apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Mentioned the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| So they have been notified, and, yes, they are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| What was their response to you, anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Well, they said they'd get a permit and talk to their architect engineer for submittal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| but I have not heard a word since that phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| So the upstairs occupancy, if they move somebody out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| they're no longer in violation there, but they still need to get a permit for the deck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Yeah, it's created an egress issue for the bar itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| And I guess their operation hours are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| The hours they operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Someone is usually there by 3 o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| I suggest that we just go ahead and call a special call meeting for Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| and we can take care of the problem Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| We probably won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Not enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| We have to have five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| That's Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Oh, it ain't no Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| My log record is Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| My log record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| It ain't going to be for Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| This is for one individual person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| This is a 48-hour notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| I was thinking of a general notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| This person here could be notified within 48 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| because they're not the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| and we don't need a general notice for the public to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| because they're coming like a court to be summoned to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| to give cause why they should not have a revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| And I think 48 hours under the Supreme Court gives people adequate notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| as to what they need to do and to make arrangements to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| So I believe it's defensible to do a 48-hour notice in a judicial hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| I was talking about a legislative hearing, which is two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| I've got my questions for Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| So you said you gave him notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| What's that notice say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| What I believe it says is they need to acquire a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| What's your follow-up date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| I think it was a 10-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| So it's been longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| It's typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| It's been longer than that, so you haven't went back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| You have not went back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| I have not, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Well, we were hoping we could remedy it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Why did you not follow up on your 10-day notice on a business that's operating illegally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| We can't remedy it without a subpoena or them coming to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| You going out and giving them a citation would give us reason to get them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| and had we been notified prior to that, we could have had them here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| Well, I will do that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So when we have a problem that they're in violation of code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| when you went out and saw that violation, did you call the codes department, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| and gave all that information out of what needed to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| Okay, from that point, where did the information go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| Did it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Where would you send the next information to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| If they're not doing what you told them to do, where would you go to next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| Well, if they didn't do what I told them to do, my remedy would be a court citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| That's basically all I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| So when they do a violation of code, which in this case is an extreme violation of code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| you give them a court citation, but that doesn't stop them from going back into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| It does not stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| So in this instance, where would you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| How would he operate to get them to abide by what he told them to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| Where would he need to go after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| He goes to the court and the court says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| we're going to rule out rent on 10 days or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| What happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| I mean, there's got to be some way that we can remedy this situation quicker than what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| And maybe we ought to look at this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| If somebody's violating, we may never have a case like this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| but if we do, how can we remedy it in a speedy way to protect the public like we're supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2092)|
| 0:35:01| So if he files the application where I'm here right now, if he files that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| shouldn't he know what he's doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| I'm here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| If he files that, shouldn't he maybe let us know so we can bring him up here to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| Would that be a situation that we would ask them to do from now on out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Because we could send them a note and say, you need to be at the next billboard meeting if we have enough time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| You said only 48 hours since it doesn't affect the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| If it occurs in the regular notice where Sandra makes the agenda and sends it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| and we have notice ahead of that, then we can notice them to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| The problem with this one is we didn't have notice to put them on the agenda for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| And right now I'm not sure that we have a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| I know we have a notice, but has anybody been cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Do we have a violation under the code to allow us to even summons them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Well, they don't have a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| It's been revoked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| It has been revoked, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| So we just need to get that information up here if we need to work on it in a quick form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| For some reason we need to get that up here so we can take the actions that we could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| And I know you're limited in what you can do, but we really need to do that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| If anything like this happens, I don't think we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| But if it does, we'll have some sort of remedy to take care of it on a speedy notion to get this over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2195)|
| 0:36:43| Yes, did you want to testify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| May I speak into this real quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Sean Payne, Knox County Building Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| We did, Mr. Lilly, Chief Building Official Randy Lilly did write a letter on December 14th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| revoking their certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Just speaking into some of the issues you all brought up and recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| in my 13 years of working with the Building Codes Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| I have never seen our office go in padlock and chain of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| I've never seen that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| I don't know if there are legal aspects, but I always compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| My only experience with the law is speeding tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| So I always compare it to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| If a state trooper pulled me over and gave me a speeding ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| is he going to tow my vehicle away to make sure I don't speed anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| It depends on how fast you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| True, or if you have a rap sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| But even then, if he has a rap sheet, does the liability fall back on that officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| I guess it's a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Does the liability fall back on that officer if I were to get in a wreck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| and kill somebody after he gave me a speeding ticket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| It's apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| There's a judicial immunity related to police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| The real issue that's before this board is all this other stuff is peripheral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| The real issue is, is there a violation whereby this board can summon these people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| to show cause as to why their license should not be revoked, suspended, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| If there is, then this board can, through the chief there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| can send a quick notice for a 48-hour return for them to come and show cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| as to why their license should not be revoked, suspended, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| If we don't have a violation, this board has no jurisdiction over these other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| That would be somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2307)|
| 0:38:36| Speaking into that as well, I believe the violation, we have already notified them by letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| Travis's extensive letter of the fire and Mr. Lilly's letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| notifying them that their certificate of occupancy has been revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| So I don't think we would go back and give them a notice of violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| when they already received a letter from the chief building official of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| that they no longer have a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Is that equivalent to a notice of violation under your . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| I think it's more extreme, yes, sir, the fact that we have revoked their CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| So this board then has a violation to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| That was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Then after that, the board can do whatever its pleasure is as it relates to the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| And if we've done that, is there a specific time limit that they have to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| Is it 10 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| At that point, they got the revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Do they have a time frame they must respond to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| Because then we can't do an emergency meeting if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| Well, if they have a notice of violation, that violation and cure of that violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| is separate and apart for them coming before you to give cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| If they come before you with 48 hours' notice and summons to give cause as to why their license should not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| then they give their argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| You weigh the evidence at that time and you go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| But they have a different process to cure the back porch and the swinging door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| the second door you need or whatever those issues are that is only one of the reasons why you would bring them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2407)|
| 0:40:17| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Mr. Law Director, do you mind if we look tomorrow morning and see if there is precedent in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| where a county has filed an injunction based on the revocation of a CO to see if we can get an emergency injunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2424)|
| 0:40:33| from a judge to suspend their license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| That may be a route we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| To lock the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Well, to suspend their beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Suspending their beer license is really what we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| I think that's incumbent upon us as a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| But there may be an emergency injunction history of precedent that's been set that we might need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| if you don't mind to research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| You know, back on Commissioner Gill's time frame, if they don't have a CO, they have no time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| They shouldn't be occupying the building and we should be enforcing that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| Every day should be a citation from somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Just to read into the record on this, I hate to pile on on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| I've been trying to listen, but it's a black and white issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| Now that we've verified in the realm of we're all angry because we're hearing about all these property code violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| but the real $10 issue is that they no longer have a CO, and according to our provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2486)|
| 0:41:35| the permittee shall not be in violation of any health, building, or fire regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| What we deal with is the beer code, and we have a violation of a building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| which is clearly laid out in our laws that we're governing as a body, as a legislative or as a judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2507)|
| 0:41:55| So anything we do has to be in this context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Now, we're all angry as heck because of this other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| And my take is also what makes this egregious is the fact that they intentionally misled our permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| by this construction process based on what we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| We don't know for a fact, but we've been led to believe that the construction of the deck happened immediately after getting their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| Now, that sounds believable, but we just have to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| and it appears since we do have evidence that this violation has been issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| in my opinion, we have the ability to rule on the beer license just based on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2547)|
| 0:42:39| Okay, so we need to set a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| Does Friday work for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| What time Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| I guess the room is probably available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Yeah, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| Excuse me, Commissioners, that's the Friday before Christmas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| and it has been as long as I've been here that the mayor tends to send out an e-mail early in the day to go home early that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2582)|
| 0:43:10| Not all of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| The building code's office stays open, but that is something that normally happens the day before Christmas break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| We just need a quorum and a law director that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| We can't do it Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| If you could give them notice, Chief, by early in the morning sometime tomorrow or today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| then we could do it Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| Forty-eight hours' notice so they can make arrangements to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Who's going to do the notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Who's going to top it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| What about Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| Friday afternoon or Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| If it gets served tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| So now when this is served and we talk to him Thursday, if these are still issues going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| then can Wolfie go pick up the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| Once you all make a judicial decision after he has had an opportunity to show cause as to why not you should make that decision against him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| then whatever you all decide is immediate, and Wolfie can do whatever you order him to do at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| Either nothing or suspend or revoke or whatever it is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| So do you want to go home early that day, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| The earlier the better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| It doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| This room is available for May 2 on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Does Thursday work best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Do you think we'd be able to get notice out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| Because there may be some people that take Friday off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Thursday at 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Do we need to vote on that or do we just call the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Do I have a motion to set this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| This is Thursday at 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Selfishly speaking, would it be possible to move it to 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| I've got a meeting right before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Happy New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Can I get a substitute motion then or amendment to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I'll amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| 1 to 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| 1 to 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| 1 to 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Will that be enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| 30 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| 1 to 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| 1 to 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Can you use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| We're talking about 1.30 to 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| We'll be doing that at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| That only takes us an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| What goes on at 2.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| I've got another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Well, the heck with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| It's just the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| It's the law of the society, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| There's a committee behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Or they can still have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| There's a committee behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Or they can still have a meeting after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Or they can surrender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| They can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| If you've got a quorum, you can do it at 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| I just may be late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| So, if it operationally, if it works better to do it at 1, I just may be a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| But we'll still have quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| If they surrender it, what will be the process of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Cancel it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| No amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| No amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2775)|

| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| I'm going to call this meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| I can barely hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment and let Brad recognize some employees in the parks and recs department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| Knox County Sports Park received an award from the World Sports League named it the sports complex of the year in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2958)|
| 0:49:29| which is a very prestigious honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| And Brad wanted to take a moment to recognize the men that work there to keep this park running so efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure we recognized before the holidays got through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| Mayor, if you want to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| And Doug, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| Like Randy said, the sports complex on Oak Ridge Highway, which is smack in the middle of the 6th District, is busy every weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=2989)|
| 0:50:02| During the softball season, it's seven days a week, and during the travel ball season, it's four or five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| And so it's always well maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| It's always well kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| And so I wanted to take a minute and recognize the team that makes that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| And I'll just kind of read a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| The World Sports League is a national organization that hosts thousands of adult slow pitch softball tournaments across 34 states each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| The sports park located at 8050 Oak Ridge Highway features baseball, softball fields, and one field just for baseball and some practice facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3026)|
| 0:50:35| Each year, we recognize a complex of the year whose staff has gone above and beyond, and we've always had a great partnership with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| There's 39 complexes up in the state of Tennessee last year, and this one was picked the best in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| So, Doug, I don't have the names of the guys here, but if Doug wants to come and kind of speak to it a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3049)|
| 0:50:57| I just wanted to recognize these guys for the work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Did y'all bring your award that you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| So, Doug, if you'd say a word or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3063)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| It's just my pleasure to recognize these fellows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| They're like a lot of the folks in Parks and Recreation and county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| They do a great job day in and day out, and I would say the parksters are kind of the front yard of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| and they do a great job making our front yard look beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| So this is a great award at a state level, and we're running for a national award, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| So I'd just like to recognize each one of these guys, and the mayor said y'all got to keep your comments down to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| A piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| But if y'all would come on up here, I'd love to see them just get in front of the mic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| and just introduce themselves and be recognized that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3103)|

| 0:52:15| They really put a good name out for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| It's the things these guys do that we don't hear about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| and this just happens to be one of those times that we hear something about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3142)|

| 0:53:05| I did want to add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| These guys, a few years ago, we infiltrated their park and put a senior center there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| and they've been very great neighbors to our senior center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| and they compliment you guys consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=3193)|

| 1:20:14| We've received, at this point, about $13 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| that's come through. There have been buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| in critical infrastructure grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| where there are federally identified sites within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4820)|

| 1:20:24| risk sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| We have the grant funds based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| SHGP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| It's regional. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| started out local, then it went to a regional basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Now, it's a regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| I'll give you all a breakdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| on what we have in this set of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| Basically, this contract is for $349,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| The District 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4842)|

| 1:20:46| We've submitted our request to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| District 2 Homeland Security approves these for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| all the local counties in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| District 2 Homeland Security, which is comprised of 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| What they've approved in this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| of $349,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| $124,000 of that is for equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| There's a federally authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| equipment list that they have to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| They can select...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| All the first responder agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| prioritize what their requests are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| and then they submit it to District 2 Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| and it's worked out and voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| based on that. We have eight agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| that are funded through this $124,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| out of the $349,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| that includes two law enforcement agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| that are within the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| two fire, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| rural, metro, and KFD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| emergency management, KEMA. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| volunteer rescue, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| two volunteer fire departments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| It's a multidisciplinary approach to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| and when we get together on this, what it does, it helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| people, it breaks down the barriers so these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| agencies work together, and that goes more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| into the training forum where the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| are training together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Basically, we have active shooters where we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| have multidisciplinary teams that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| are there. Basically, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| the profile on the equipment side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| The specifics on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| these agencies, they're provided funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| for authorized equipment for hazmat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| EOD, and rescue equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Then you go back to the communications piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| There are mobile repeaters on this equipment list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| that's been authorized and will be purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Interoper communications is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| to be a piece of this, and that is like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| very big budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Sometimes the volunteer rescue squads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| can't get to the funding for that, and it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| important because if you have an incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| you have to have multiple type teams and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| agencies respond to that, and sometimes if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| can't talk to each other, it hurts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| the effectiveness of the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| There's been a big focus through interoper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| communications through these grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| The other component on your worksheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| there is the District 2 Homeland Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| training. Back in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| we went to the regional component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| It was decided then that sometimes when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| budgets get cut in government, one of the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| things to go is the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| The recommendation was back in 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| to have a regional training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| I think about 2,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| people are trained annually through our regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| training program. It's multidisciplinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| It's FIRE, EMS, EMA. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| one training. It just depends on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| the training subcommittee from the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| prioritizes to move forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| We take that recommendation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| training subcommittee. It goes to the state team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| as SAA. They approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| and we go back and we have management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| funds. We have a team in place on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| training program that delivers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| throughout the year. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| basically the profile and breakdown of the 349.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| It's been a very, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| good thing. We work with the 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| The CCTA grant, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| is the Complex Coordinated Terrorist Attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| that's going to have a little bit different approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| This is more equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| and training. The CCTA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| is going to go into a gaps analysis for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| 16 counties. It's brand new on the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| level. Basically, they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| look at where, identify within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| what their gaps are. Then there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| will be training that will come into play on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| Then there will be conferences that come toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| the third year at the end of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| It's a little bit different approach where that's going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| into more of the plans and the policy side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| of the counties and also to help people have better response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I don't know if anyone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| any questions or if I missed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| That's the breakdown on this 349.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Probably more information than you wanted to have on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| You have the sheets there that gives the breakdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5044)|

| 1:26:06| they wanted to add some clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| language to identify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| charter in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Do you have anything else you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| That was the only reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| because we were dealing with insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| and bonds and the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| addressed it and the state law addressed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| and we really wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| enhance our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5184)|

| 1:26:30| to trace back how it worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| and when we did it. It was just an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| administrative thing. I thought it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| better if we strengthened our part of it for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5196)|

| 1:27:28| amendment that you strike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| number two of renumbering the school's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5250)|

| 1:27:34| the agendas. I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| has any value and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| the other rule changes do but this one has no value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| and it serves no purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| I think you would also have to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5262)|

| 1:28:22| I would like to discuss. How are we going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| individual sentences and what's before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| Are we going to have motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| per item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5314)|

| 1:28:38| to have to have everything in one motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| be specific in what I want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| or what I would offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| is on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5326)|

| 1:29:10| Further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5350)|

| 1:29:26| organizations parts protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| by Supreme Court rulings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5368)|

| 1:29:32| to associate politically with whom I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| wish. Now there are other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| that govern us that are like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| sunshine and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| what we discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5382)|

| 1:29:46| So I believe those rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| apply and that last sentence is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| infringement upon my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5390)|

| 1:30:04| sometimes we sunshine these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5404)|

| 1:30:12| media. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| if you look at the two forms that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| we send out, one is an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5416)|

| 1:30:20| agenda. Just because two commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| show up there, they do not have the right to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| business or anything other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5424)|

| 1:30:28| that has the intent of a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| meeting. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| when you show up there, you have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| agenda. You have to turn in minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| Just because you show up at an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| that's been published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| doesn't mean you can start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| to talk about county business and call that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| sunshine. If you are, you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| be turning in minutes for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| But unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| I had asked that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| be broke down into several different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| but that was not what the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| has not brought that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| So it's really not on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| floor right now, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| ask the rules committee to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| You are the commission. You can amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| as you please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| They are your rules. But you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| a committee to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| this and research and study it for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| and bring it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| The motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| could be any amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| to these rules as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Commissioner Andrews did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| In addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| It's up to you all how you want to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| Okay, so you're saying we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| have the ability to make a further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| amendment at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| So I'll open up discussion to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| How does everyone feel about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| what Commissioner Wright is suggesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| Striking that sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| I will include that in my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| If Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Commissioner Wright would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| Terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| Include that sentence, be deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| If that will cure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| What Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Wright said, reading this, it seems as if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| the intent was really just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| save some time and almost do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| with one notification of the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| to set it and forget it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| in terms of notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| of reoccurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| parties or events or things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| that commissioners may show up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| I go to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| civic club, kind of like a rotary, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Civitan club. This strikes me as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| other than the word political organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| strikes me as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| when it was originally written, the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| was to turn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| one notification to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| the office, a list of all the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| that you might be showing up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| that were related to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| where there was a chance encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| with another county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| And I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| we've all ran into each other at the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| at a football game or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| and I don't feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| if I run into a commissioner at a basketball game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| that I'm going to have to turn in minutes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| hey, go Vols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| But if I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| have a lunch to talk about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| that's important and relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| that needs to be clear, that that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| So this might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| maybe it makes it a little bit vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| and that may be one of the unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| is often, and I'm guilty of this, I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| sometimes I need to turn in a notice if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| going to go to an event that I think other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| commissioners may or may not show up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| It's a chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| Ms. Shaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| I just want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| for sure exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| what we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| I serve on numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| board organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| and we have a lot of fundraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| and most of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| our non-profit boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| send out to all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| commissioners asking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| if they would like to buy a ticket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| So are we seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| that every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| one of us goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| or decides we're going to go to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| to send out a notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| it's not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| well defined, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| When we all get invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| to go somewhere, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| don't feel the need that I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| have a public notice sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| saying Michelle Carringer is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| attend the East Tennessee Epilepsy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Foundation's Mardi Gras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| I'm not discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| county commission, it's about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| And everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| we go, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| there's a time limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| we're supposed to notice that and sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| we don't know until the day before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| that someone's having something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| and there may be other commissioners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| So as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| county business is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| not being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| not a notice. If we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| to discuss county business, then we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| to make sure that there is a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| notice put out and it specifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| what we're going to be discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| The easy rule is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| this. You've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| invited to attend somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Do you have the authority to invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| someone else? If you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| then the public does not have a right to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| If I have a birthday party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| and I invite Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Schoonmaker to come and I invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| John to come and we're having a birthday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| party, they don't have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| to invite somebody else to the birthday party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| I'm having. But if you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| gathering together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| specifically discuss county business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| then you have to notice it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| specificity, give the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| ample time to attend and know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| what it is you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| When you're going to all of these charity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| events or you go to all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| Christmas parties that you all may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| invited to different ones and you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| happen to show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| those are not necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| to be publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| In the past, the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| under the Fantzler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| ruling did things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| in an extreme abundance of caution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| issues related to what had happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| in the past. But as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| as the law is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| if you call a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| specific meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| to talk about county business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| then you have to have a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| amount of notice and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| you have to be specific with what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| you're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| But these general parties and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| things, I think what they were doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| is to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| Is it Rotary Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| I'm a member of the Civitan Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| It's on Fridays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| A lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| commissioners like to give notices to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| things they're doing, where they're going to be in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| some of their constituents want to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| or maybe they're going to be there at the same club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| and they've got something they want to talk to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| So the commissioners also use those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| but they generally don't invite the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| to attend. They just say, I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| at this club this time, I'm going to this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| I'm going to have this party, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| give an award at Ted Russell Ford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| I'm going to be at so and so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| That is just to let the public know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| where you're going to be in case they want to come by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| and see you. But if you're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| business and you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| have more than one of you there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| then you shall give notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| and the press and the public shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| have a right to attend. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| really what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| So we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| have this worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| If we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| somewhere, we do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| to send out that public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| The only public notice that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| have to put out is if we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| going to meet with another commissioner and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| about any commission business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| and we have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| that detailed what we're going to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| in that public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| So however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| I think if you strike that, it's going to pretty much say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Thank you. Commissioner Meisner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| I think a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| of us, and I'm pointing the finger at myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| tend to react out of an abundance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| caution to make sure that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| not violating the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| As an example, I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| at a meeting about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I don't know, six months ago, I wanted an ice cream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| cone after we'd had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| I think either audit or a pension meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| And I'd mentioned offhand that I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| go get an ice cream and John Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| overheard me and he said, I want an ice cream cone too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| And I said, well, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| we need to make sure that there's at least ten feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| between us when we walk down Gay Street to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| to the ice cream place, just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| frankly, we didn't want to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| the perception in the eyes of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| And I know this is kind of funny, but this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| real conversation. We did not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| to create a perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| that he and I were walking out of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| county building to have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| unauthorized meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| And another thing related to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| issue is, I truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| a lot of the public, this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| very sensitive issue, rightfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| so, but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| think that the public even really knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| the specificity of this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| versus notification. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| almost wonder if on our commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| website, there could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| a link or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| summary, not just as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| a reminder for commissioners, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| as a reminder for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| just to say a reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| on county sunshine law, our notification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| just for the benefit of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| public, it also allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| us to say, we're going to an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| or if somebody said, hey, you guys didn't sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| that, well actually, reference this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| it's on our county commission website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| there's a link to it regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| Fansler decision, but in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| layman's English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| some summary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| the key points on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| it'll serve as a reminder for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| us and future commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| and it will also be something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| we can reference, and by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| thank you for bringing up the fact that there are notifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| where we do want to notify folks that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| going to events and things like that to show that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| we're doing our job, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| good, I never really thought of the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| of, you know, sometimes I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| I was sending notices out just to CYA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| but this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| and I'm glad we're bringing this up, because this could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| a good way to fix it, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| I know we've got the motion at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| but in the future, I may want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| to work with, maybe we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| craft some sort of document that summarizes this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| up with a link to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| legalese, but in common sense language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| that we can then maybe post a link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| to our commission website just to use as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| reference for the public and a reminder to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| of us. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| issue with, I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| issue with Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| that no consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| to the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| for moving schools to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| back of the agenda and having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| general government and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| an education calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| There is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| air quality, risk management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| procurement, park and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6090)|

| 1:41:40| probably other offices out there that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| twice a month and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| they have to sit through a consent calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| that we have, all we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| are going to do is vote yes. We cannot vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| no. So yes, there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| consequence to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| these employees out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| that are in county government that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| to sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Mr. Oaks, Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| they're here every time. I've never seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| one of them get up and leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| before the commission meeting was over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| I applaud you. I think that is fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| that you come and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| stay. But to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| that there's no consequences, I look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| consequences sitting out here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| That these people are sitting out here now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| and they deserve the same respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| that a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| employee should have. And there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| wrong, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| a school consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| and a general government consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Now, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| the last strike and the last sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| But as the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| the motion goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| I'm going to have to vote no. And that means I'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| voting down the whole rules committee that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| And I don't want to do that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| I still think that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| government employees out here should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| the same right and the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| I'm not going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| right, I'm going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| I'm lost for a word. They should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| able to come and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| their agenda heard first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Then we'll go through the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Now, if we could vote for the school agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| and change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| something that, you know, this bill's not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| to be paid, that would be a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| But we can't do that. All we're doing is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| approving a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| And that's all that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| I was approached about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| That's what I was asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| And I agree with it 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| To the people that had asked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| to do this, I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| with you 100% and it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| that way. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Mr. Bentley, I'd like to point out that the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| employees are also county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| These Knox County employees deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| the same as those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| I wanted to ask the law director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| like with city council and some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| when things are on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| they can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| read, they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| say R-17-12-802| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| and they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| have to read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| caption there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| something that county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| have on consent for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| clerks just to read that and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| read the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| No, you're really reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| in for the record and you want to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| a record because you're a legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| whereby people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| can challenge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| What the city does, I can't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| that was being brought up and no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| knew about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| I wanted to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| if that was even an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6300)|
| 1:45:16| Commissioner Daly, I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| your hard work on the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| but you could make a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| motion for what you believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6322)|
| 1:45:34| I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| I'm going to vote either up or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| down on this motion. I don't think the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| should have been. I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| with Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| on the last sentence but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| it's not hurting anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| but helping the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| county government departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| which is many, many departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| It helps them so I'm not going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| a substitute motion. I'm going to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| vote as it stands. I'll just vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| and I'll have to vote no on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| Commissioner Daly, I'd also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| like to thank you for the hard work you did put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| There are many good things that have come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| the rules committee so far this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And these were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| recommendations from the rules commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| to the full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| Yes, and I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| four to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| Seeing no lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| Before you make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| Commissioner Daly. Just make sure that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| not any other adjustments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| someone feels it needs to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| Mr. Wright had one. I don't know if anybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| I was hoping we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| have this discussion last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Monday but it didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| We had the same exact discussion last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| I gave a comment about the schools just like last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| I'm talking about Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| He had a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| We could have had that struck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| it was brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| and I serve on the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| The one thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| to bring it to full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| this has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| brought up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| No one has addressed me that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| have an issue with how we run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Whether we have schools first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| or county business or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| In discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| it in rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| if some of the commissioners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| had people bring this up to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| they wanted us to change it, then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| our responsibility to bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| before commission, the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| to let the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| vote on that and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| voice their opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| on if they've had anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| complain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| about it or want us to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I haven't had anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| address this issue with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| I'm really interested in is there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| commissioners that have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| this brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| before them that we change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Before I make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| a clear vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| I'd really like to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| from all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| I'm just wondering if we'd be better served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| since the commission seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| somewhat divided on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| to ask the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| if we could send this back and let them consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| opinions given here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| and give everybody a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| come to the next rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| meeting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| voice their opinions rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| vote on something that seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| there's kind of muddled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| opinions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Chairman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| I serve on the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| Evelyn serves on the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| And Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| Boesler is our chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| I mean, Mr. Daly is our chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| Charlie, you were last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| This seems like yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| But anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| yeah, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| that would be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| if we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| to do a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| then I would be glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| to make the substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| have another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| rules committee, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| after the first of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| before we make any hasty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| because there seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| a lot of discussion. So I want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| when we move something that it's for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| the good of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| And our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| commission can agree as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| possible on it. So I will make that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| substitute motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| bring this agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| item back up at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| next rules committee and that we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| send it out for all commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| that want to have a voice about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| this to attend our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Yeah, I find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| it really doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| how these rules are written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| I just see no value in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| change for the sake of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| if we send it back to rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| it will be the fourth time that we've openly discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| everybody's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| First was the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Then we talked about it in a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=6654)|

| 1:59:12| A losing side or a winning side can bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7152)|

| 1:59:34| What he's looking at is there's somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| can bring this back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| This can be brought up any time after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| The prevailing side means who can bring it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| before this meeting adjourns again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| And since nobody prevailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| I would presume anyone can bring it up again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| before you adjourn to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7188)|

| 1:59:52| anybody can bring it up into the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| They can call another Rules Committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| as the chairman and do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| But right now, the current rules are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| and the current rules are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7202)|

| 2:00:10| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7210)|

| 2:00:20| hear this again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| and then I'll have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| It takes two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7226)|

| 2:00:34| Two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7234)|

| 2:03:33| This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7413)|

| 2:03:57| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| Last week we discussed about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| DUI litter pickup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| and I did get in contact with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| Lieutenant Governor's office and they requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| that we do a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| asking that the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7453)|

| 2:04:17| litter pickup for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| Tennessee as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| of the DUI sentencing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| Tennessee Code Annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| And I ask that we support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| unanimously and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| we get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| hopefully we can get the litter crew back out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| picking up trash on the sides of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| We're losing a lot of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| We're losing a lot of man hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Hopefully my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| will make this unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| I'm wholeheartedly for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| Mr. Law Director, what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| in their current opt-in and all of our judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| have opted out. Is that the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| setup? The current law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| talks about community service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| and under the DUI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| and this particular activity is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| not community service as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| deem it. So we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| it's not an opt-in or opt-out. It just means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| community service. They can either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| order it to be done or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| and the legislatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| in our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| asked for something also to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| Knox County, we asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| them and they wanted us to approve something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| to help them get this approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| as part of the definition of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| service or allow it to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| Commissioner Wright? Yes, expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| on that. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| on that just a moment. It's not a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| of the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| sentence so that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| those that are in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| plead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| guilty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| then the judge doesn't even have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| it on the table to give this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| So that's the reason we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| need to unanimously support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| this so that our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| can get us back on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| road to picking up trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| Thank you. I have done some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| Dayston County does have a litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| pickup crew. They charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| $132 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7577)|

| 2:06:21| going out and pick up litter. Ours is only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| $42.60, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| The reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| that there is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| a litter crew, DUI litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| crew, today is that the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| was passed that the mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| 24 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| litter pickup was taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| away. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| yes, a judge can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| sentence someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| to do that, but it will never get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| far. That's why you do not see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| judges. It's either a plea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| bargained out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| beforehand and nobody's going to plea bargain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| for 24 hours extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| of picking up trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| And if it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| yes, the DA can ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| penalties like litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| pickup, but that usually does not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| And I don't think it's happened in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| year and a half since this law has been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=7633)|
