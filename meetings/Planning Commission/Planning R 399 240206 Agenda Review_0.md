| 0:02:37| to keep you all updated on that progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| The Information Services team has stayed pretty busy over the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| They are continuing to support the City of Knoxville's, the development of their housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| It's tentatively to be unveiled this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Our staff support includes a performance metrics dashboard, a narrative story map, and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| data collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| The Information Services team has also completed a five-year contract supporting planning work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| of the Knox County Schools, by managing their enrollment projections model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| We've had an operating agreement in place since 2006 with the schools, and informal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| support for many years prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| So we will be meeting with district staff this week to discuss continuation of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| collaboration efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| And finally, it's work program and budget season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| So we have been in the process of meeting with a number of departments in the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| county in advance of meetings with city council and county commission over the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| And that's all the updates I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| We'll go ahead and jump into the review of agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| The first one we have is item number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| These are updates to our proposed amendments to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| Andrea has been working on these over the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| The proposed amendments are really intended to align with changes in Tennessee Code annotated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| and provide additional clarification in a number of sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Staff has also done a great job of consulting with our partners in the city and county and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| reaching out to surveyors throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| So I'm going to turn it over to Andrea and she'll give you a high level overview of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| edits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| Amy took away some of my initial thunder here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Yes, we're requesting the Planning Commission consider amendments to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| As Amy mentioned, these are to capture changes to the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| The current version was adopted in March of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| We've been working on these changes for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| We've held meetings with city staff, including representatives from the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| as well as the plans review and inspections department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| We also involved Knox County Engineering and Public Works, some staff from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| Both jurisdictions had the opportunity for their law department to provide comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| Planning staff also collaborated with multiple utility districts, including representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| from Knoxville Utilities Board, West Knox Utilities District, Northeast Knox, First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| Utility Districts, and Hallsdale-Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| The staff memo that was provided lists all the amendments by section in list two, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| then the first list has some of the more substantial changes, and I'll go over a few of those with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| Item one was a change in state law, allowing planning staff to approve subdivision plats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| with no more than 25 lots if a concept plan was previously approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| Consequently, Planning Commission approval is now required for plats with 26 or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| lots or plats with a variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Based on this change, all phases or units of an approved concept plan, no matter the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| number of lots being created, will require final plat approval by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:37| The next item I wanted to point out was item number three, which is also relative to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| state law pertaining to natural gas transmission pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| This law went into effect in July of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| It requires developers to contact the operator of a natural gas transmission pipeline when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| development is planned within 660 feet of the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| The law applies to both new and non-residential development, and based on this, language was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| added to the subdivision regulations to provide a note that must be included on final plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=430)|
| 0:07:23| Item number five is in reference to corrected plats, replats, and resubdivision plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| There has occasionally been confusion regarding the appropriate plat title for different types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| of minor subdivision plats, and so we've modified the regulations to provide language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| attempting to clarify the appropriate plat title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| Corrected plats fix an error discovered on the plat after recording, such as a misspelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| street name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| This section was not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| However, new subsections were added to address replats and resubdivision plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| Plats record new information on a previously recorded plat, provided the ownership, size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| and dimensions of the lots have not changed, whereas a resubdivision plat creates new lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| by combining or adjusting lot lines between existing recorded lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| Item number nine refers to mapping and engineering information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| There are several sections in the subdivision regulations that were modified to capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| A few examples of the changes include no longer requiring a tie to the city's survey control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| system, providing different criteria to identify owners of adjacent property on a plat for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| property that has been previously platted versus property that was never platted, requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| the bearings and distances on the plat to be labeled in a clockwise direction, and including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| the instrument number assigned by the Knox County Register of Deeds for all recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| easements and homeowners association documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| Item 10 addresses another state law change regarding developments near established sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| shooting ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| This law applies to subdivisions located in whole or in part within 1,000 feet of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| shooting range, and a new section was added to the regulations providing a specific note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:36| that's required on the plat prior to recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=576)|
| 0:09:46| Item 13 is also related to a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| The existing regulations were found to be more stringent than the state law based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| the state's definition of a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Therefore, the section on exempt plats was changed to better comply with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| We have included a note suggesting the surveyors, a suggested note that the surveyors can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| when recording the plat, and we had removed the certification stamp that was listed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| the regulations currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| We are also encouraging due diligence to ensure an exempt plat is not potentially creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| a substandard lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| Item 14 is related to shared permanent access easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| A few modifications were made to this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| These easements may now serve attached dwelling units in Knox County so long as the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| serves no more than 10 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| The language regarding the maintenance agreement for the easement was also updated to now explicitly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| require all property owners to be included in the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Additionally, the final plat must show all lots using the access easement up to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=664)|

| 0:11:13| So our recommendation to the Planning Commission is to approve the amendments to the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| regulations as identified in the track changes document that was part of the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| We are proposing an effective date of April 1st, and this will provide time for surveyors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| and staff to become acquainted with the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| Am I correct that this is the ordinance, this is the area where in cases that we hear frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| there are benefits and amenities that are described in subdivisions, and we've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| lot of conversation in the Planning Commission about what that really means, the common areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:12:04| what those benefits and amenities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| Is this the correct spot for that to be addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| We wouldn't recommend that that be addressed at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| We would recommend that that's something that would be tackled if the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| is updated and we get to work on a new code, which would also include additional updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| So the intent of these updates was really some cleanup and make sure that we were complying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Also, there's some zones like the planned residential zone speaks to some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| that you touched on as well, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| So the UDO would be the place where that would be more adequately addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| That's staff's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| I don't know if Steve, he's nodding his head, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:13:02| Does the city, so the city shares the same subdivision regulations with the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| There are some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| When you read through the subdivision regulations, though, you'll be able to see some differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| in how each of them approach things, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| And, like if you're to, if a piece of property is going to be divided into, what, more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=795)|
| 0:13:26| two lots, do they need to have subdivision regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| Or how do they decide, how do you determine whether someone needs to go into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:39| Any subdivision of land would need to comply with the regulations that have been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| So, even if they're divided into two lots, they would have to have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Maybe a dumb question, but just curious, like procedurally, so these changes came from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| state initially, and what's the city's engagement kind of, as those changes are being drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| like with the state group, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| It wasn't that the state proposed any changes, they just adopted new laws that were not captured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| in the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| So, we wanted to comply and have our regulations align more closely with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| And what was their engagement with like that state lawmaking, like previously, or was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| kind of a law that we're just reacting to, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| I'm just curious if there's inclusion kind of in the upstream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Right, it's more reactionary to the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=873)|

| 0:14:40| Okay, now we are going to move on to item number 34, which is 2EE24SB, and also, Inclusory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Turn it over to Samuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=889)|
| 0:15:06| Hi, everyone, I apologize in advance if my presentation is disrupted by my coughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=906)|
| 0:15:25| So the first item is item 34, this request is to rezone the 75-acre property on Roberts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| Road from A to the PR up to a three-dueling unit barricade with a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| from AG to the LDR classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| The property is located approximately 1,800 feet north of the intersection of Roberts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| Road and Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| This falls within the rural area designation of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| The area is predominantly zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| The subject property is adjacent to a subdivision zoned PR up to three-dueling unit barricade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| The other PR zoned property was rezoned in 1996, but it's not developed to its capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| of up to four-dueling unit barricade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| For both of these PR zoned properties, planning staff had recommended a density of one-dueling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| unit barricade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| The land use classification of the northwest county sector plan is agricultural, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| permits consideration of PR zoning up to one-dueling unit barricade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| All surrounding parcels also have the AG classification, including the two nearby properties with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=999)|

| 0:16:49| It is to be noted that the southern property was approved for a sector plan amendment from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| AG and RR to LDR in 2002, though planning staff had recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1014)|
| 0:17:02| With public input, this was reclassified as AG in the 2015 sector plan update, indicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| the ongoing intention for this land use to remain agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| The subject property includes some prime farmlands and locally important soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| Most of the surrounding properties are farmlands and rural residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| On the west side of the property is a TVA power station, there is a medical center nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| and a gas station at the intersection of Roberts Road and Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1053)|

| 0:17:45| Staff recommends a denial of the LDR classification lease because this would be out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| with the surrounding area, which has the AG classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1070)|
| 0:18:00| The LDR classification is not compatible with the growth policy plan's rural area designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| Staff also recommends approving the PR zone up to one-dueling unit barricade since this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| would be consistent with the rural character of the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| This would be a minor extension of the zone, the recommended density of one-dueling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| barricade is consistent with the AG classification of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| The sector plan reports that many residents choose to live here for the rural setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| and it recommends a balance between future development and protecting the qualities inherent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| If a sector plan amendment were to be approved, staff recommends approval of the RR classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| instead of the LDR classification since this would be supported by the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| That being said, the sector plan recommends a density of one-dueling unit barricade for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| the RR classification as well, so an amendment to the RR classification will not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| grant any higher density than the present AG classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1152)|

| 0:23:26| The request is to rezone from RN1 to RN6 and to amend the land use plans from low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1406)|

| 0:24:11| Zoning is a similar picture to the land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| This RN1 zone property is mostly surrounded by RN1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| It does have a small sliver of hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Immediately to the east is a neighborhood commercial zone parcel with a small automotive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1463)|

| 0:24:28| There is RN3 zoning nearby across Delrose, and further southeast there is RN5 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| and RB zoning in the county, which permits up to 12 dwelling units per acre by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:45| This lot is entirely forested that you can see in the 1953 aerial in the left corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1485)|

| 0:25:12| Next to them is where KCDC is currently constructing the Riverside at Holston apartments, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| will add another 96 units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| So we are recommending approval of RN4 rather than RN6 zoning and medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| rather than medium density residential slash office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Medium density residential is reflective of changing conditions in the area with the multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| development occurring further east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| The subject property is in closer proximity than that development to numerous amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| for residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| This includes a six minute drive from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| It's next to an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| It has access to sidewalks that actually connect all the way to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| It accesses classified streets on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| It's next to community facilities like the golf course and the botanical gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| At the botanical gardens, the East Knox Greenway is due to be extended east and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| It's walking distance from a bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| There are public improvements to Brooks Avenue planned to occur that would improve pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| and cycling amenities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| We are not recommending MDRO and RN6 because it's too intensive for the predominantly single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| family surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| With RN4 zoning, a townhouse or a low rise multifamily development would likely have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| to come through this body for special use review where we could evaluate its impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| on surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| So we think RN4 balances housing demand and amenities of this area with considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| for the residential character of the Town Hall East neighborhood where this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1618)|
| 0:27:07| What would be the total number of maximum dwelling units between RN6 and RN4 if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:16| run those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| I can do that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| I know that with RN4, if it was townhomes, and this is not considering off-street parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:28| and different landscaping requirements and all of that, the minimum lot standards would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| allow up to 430 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| And then with the maximum lot size for multifamily in RN4, which is 40,000 square feet, you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:48| have to subdivide it quite a bit, but you could get 647 multifamily units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| And then RN6, I can get back to you on those calculations maybe later in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:28:03| I guess I'm the end of it, aren't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Darn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Can you run that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| So with multifamily, it's 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| I'll let Samuel do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Thank you, Samuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Here's the total lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| I was doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Do you want to move on to the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| So this is item 27, 1D24RZ and 1B24SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| This rezoning and plan amendment case is for a 56 1⁄2 acre property on Ebenezer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| just south of its intersection with Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| 10 Mile Creek runs near its western side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| The request is to rezone approximately 24 acres in the northwest portion to OB, Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| Medical and Related Services, and the approximately 32.5 acres in the southeast portion would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| be rezoned to planned residential with a density of up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| The land use classifications that are requested already exists on this property, but will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| be shifted to different locations to align with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| And the hillside and stream protection areas would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Currently this property has planned commercial zoning along Ebenezer, PR zoning along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| southern side, and RAE, which is exclusive residential zoning, in the northeast corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| The requested OB zoning would be a minor extension from the office complex to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| The requested PR zoning would be a minor extension of several PR zones to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| and east, which range in intensity from single family to multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| The proposed PR zoning stretches to Ebenezer Road, granting direct access to that classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| So you can see in the right-hand corner where the different zones are requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| You can't see that very well, but the lined portion is where they're requesting PR, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| the hatched portion is where they're requesting OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| So you can see it kind of aligns with the existing zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| The proposed land use amendment does not change what classifications exist, as I said, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| it does shift them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| So you can see in the upper right-hand corner, a little portion of O zoning, or I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| O land use classification would be extended further northeast, and then there's a section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| of low-density residential that's requested for the southern portion that faces Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1834)|
| 0:30:44| So the requested zoning aligns with the existing land use pattern, which has office and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| uses to the northwest and west, and residential uses to the south and east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| So it's consistent with this kind of transitional location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| The black and white aerial image in the corner here, sorry, these are not that easy to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| but when you compare it to the current aerial, you can see how this property has become a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| bit of an outlier with its agricultural land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| There's been numerous developments over the past 15 years, both commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| It's also noteworthy that you can kind of, I'll use my laser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| There are stub-outs that connect to this property in several locations that abut other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| residential subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| I think a primary concern expressed by surrounding residents is not wanting those access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| to their neighborhood to be utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| A future development plan would not necessarily utilize them, but having that option does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| support improved connectivity, which is consistent with development policies in the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| to not have isolated pockets of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| We are recommending approval as requested because they are minor extensions that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| It's also consistent with changing conditions, such as this roadway improvement that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| can see that occurred in 2018, which added lanes and provided a signal at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1933)|

| 0:32:36| Happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I do have that RN-6 calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| I've got a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| In looking at some of the other PR cases that we have, then this might be a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| Director Brooks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| With regards to step-outs that exist, can we make a condition on the PR that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| to connect before a concept plan is presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| That is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:17| Oftentimes, a lot of work that the developer does to bring forth a plan that may not connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| could be beneficial to make them go through with the work to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I cannot think of anything that would prevent you all from making that condition of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| when there's already...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Well, I mean, you do it on a regular basis to create step-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| We'd want to consult with our colleagues in engineering as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Then, sort of the flip to that same question is, when we are approving a PR that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| isn't connecting yet to an existing subdivision, can we condition a step-out with the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| of PR prior to the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| So, say, approve PR up to five units per acre with a step-out connection to parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| number X next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| You can do conditional zoning in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| For a step-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I can't think of any specific examples where that has taken place in the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| I don't know if any other staff, in particular Mr. Reynolds, might...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| I remember a condition of zoning that prohibited connection to a step-out, because there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:44| a desire to not connect, and that was part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| So, you can definitely do it the opposite direction, as well, if you can prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| I guess that was going to be one of my comments, because we don't really know what the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| has planned up there, and I believe there's some opposition from the neighbors next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| If it's a different concept or a different use, I mean, it's still in-plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| but there's a wide variety of uses in there that they may not want a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| I mean, I see it's laid out for that option, but there may be some resistance from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| neighbors to have any sort of connection, so I would just throw that out there for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| I mean, I can see that maybe one...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| I mean, I think there are three step-outs on this particular property, and if we only...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| Let's say they only use one, that could have a potential negative effect, as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2141)|
| 0:35:50| using three, because you've funneled all the flow to there and the primary entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| So how do we look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Well, we definitely try to find the properties or the step-outs that are feasible to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:07| to, because it may not be feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| The one thing, I believe this property, I haven't looked at it in great detail, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| I think it lays pretty well, so those are all probably able to be connected to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2173)|
| 0:36:21| It really is a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| Look at the road system, how much traffic might be going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Is this property going to have its own access to the external street, whereas the step-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| connections really do provide that additional emergency access and such, so you may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| need...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Like, for instance, the development that has, to the south, has two step-outs that are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| To be connected to both of them really doesn't provide any significant connectivity between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:56| the developments, but maybe one to the south and one to the east makes most sense, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| a safety standpoint, and also just general traffic dispersion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| But yeah, this is really case-by-case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Mike, I think from an engineering perspective, the step-out to the south, the long road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:21| we would at least, if they don't make that connection, ask for a turnaround there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| That's too far for a fire truck or emergency vehicle to back out of there, so if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| do that connection, they would need to provide a turnaround on their side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| for that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| And so, what Steve's talking about is, fire trucks are only supposed to back up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| 150 feet, so if you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| In this case, we have this dead-end stub road, so if those stub roads do not continue, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| needs to be a cul-de-sac, some other turnaround provided in this development for that turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| Is that step-out to the north accessible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| Because it sort of appeared to dead-end into a different property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| Could you use your laser pointer to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| You're talking about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| That one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| I think the access...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| The step-out points are here, here...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Right, those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| And here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| There's almost four, but not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Yeah, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| This is sort of a general question, but it's one that I think, because of Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:38| Shelsha's comment, I just want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| And that's about our charge as a commission to be looking for those connectivity options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:52| in terms of planning and thinking ahead and trying to do the right thing for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| writ large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| I feel like it is in our guidance as commissioners to do that, but I guess I'm asking for help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2339)|
| 0:39:10| in pointing to where that guidance comes from and if I'm misconstruing that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| My comment would be, I think we put some weight on the will of the community and see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| their desire is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| That's not the only thing that we consider, but if this becomes, let's say, a cut-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| it could be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| A step-out could be a negative as much as often they're a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| And I think we just need to analyze those case-by-case as Mike described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| I hear your point very much about if you put all the movement in this one, that could overburden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| that area as opposed to dispersing it or finding the right spots for connectivity based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:40:03| upon the land and development, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| But I guess what I'm struggling with and just kind of putting it out there is the tendency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| for large plans, like a general plan or plans that are speaking to general development wishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2413)|
| 0:40:23| to talk about, we want connectivity, we want things to be easier, we want sidewalks, et| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| And then when we get down to the granular, like a very specific development, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| have different voices and they may be the exact same voices that want that in theory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| or want that when they're thinking about it, but then they kind of get nervous when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| see it right in their map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| So I guess I'm just pointing that out that while we need to definitely listen to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| community, we've kind of got the same community saying two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| And how do we as a body need to consider that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| I think it's been a consistent challenge over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| I don't think it's unique to this body or this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I mean, I think those tensions exist in many, many different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| I will point out that in our subdivision regulations, and I know staff has pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| this out for past cases, is that there is a very short line, but it does talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| street connectivity and interconnected street system as an important component of sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| neighborhood development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| So it is, to your point, it is included in all of our documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| And in the current subregs online, it kind of breaks up that section by accident or puts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| a big space in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| So there's a whole section below there talking about purpose of interconnected street systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| and why they're important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| We've got a case that we're not talking about today, but it's the Twin Oak Landing next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| to Gibbs, all three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| And it's right next to a subdivision that if it had been granted or been required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| have a connectivity, then that entire subdivision would be able to walk to school through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| one that we're about to prove that has a very nice walkway to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| Instead they have to drive about a mile or so around everything to get to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| So that's why I was asking about, can we require it with the zoning so that we just start getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| these concept plans that can help build that connectivity in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| And I just want to point out on that one in particular, there is a sidewalk connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| between all those subdivisions that will get down to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| That was something that was able to get incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| So even though there's not a street connection, there will be a sidewall connection that connects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| all of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| Maybe just another philosophical question, but how do we also think about the desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| potentially of existing neighborhoods versus you're going to have hundreds of people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| are going to live here in five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Are we charged with thinking about the potential desires of that group or the existing residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:15| who surround it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Do they get to have an outspoken say because they're there first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| And so I don't know if there's a clear answer to that, but that's something I wrestle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| In this rezoning case, I do reference development policy in the general plan to avoid creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| small isolated pockets of residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| And another point in the general plan is an emphasis on more interconnecting streets and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| fewer cul-de-sacs to minimize travel and reduce air pollution, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| So there is support in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| So we'll move on to the last one that we have identified on our agenda, number 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:44:01| I'll be brief on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| This is a rezoning for a 1.85 acre parcel on Ellis Town Road near the intersection with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Ellis Town Road terminates to the southeast at Holston River and Legg Creek forms the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| rear of this lot as it heads towards Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| The request is to rezone from agricultural to RA, low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| This lot is surrounded by agricultural zoning, though there is a large area of PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| with a density up to four dwelling units an acre to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| The industrial zoning to the southwest is where the Poplar View Landfill is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| and there is some commercial zoning along Rutledge Pike as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| The land use classification for the parcel in the area to the north is low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| light industrial on the other side of Legg Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| Although this area is zoned agricultural, most lots along this section of Ellis Town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| Road are single family residential with lots approximating about an acre in size consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| with the agricultural area regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| This is a wooded neighborhood with farmland to the north, although a residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| plan was approved by Planning Commission in 2005 to create a subdivision out of that farmland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| but it was never constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| We're recommending approval of planned residential up to 1.5 dwelling unit per acre rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| RA because it's responsive to environmental conditions, including steep slopes on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| property and the creek running along the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| The density would allow one additional unit, which is in character with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| residential lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| I'm only presenting on this case because the recommendation differs from the request, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| the applicant has stated that they accept the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2743)|
| 0:45:52| And going back to the RN-6 density, thank you Samuel for doing the calcs, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| 647 townhomes and 1,848 multifamily units in RN-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:46:08| That compares to, so 647 townhomes with RN-6, 430 with RN-4, 1,848 multifamily units with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2768)|
| 0:46:19| RN-6, and 647 with RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| But again, that's not taking into account all the other conditions that affect the intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| of that cliff, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Are there any other items that may be of interest to the Commission you'd like to bring forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| Do you have anything else, Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| You're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240206-agenda-review?start=2809)|
