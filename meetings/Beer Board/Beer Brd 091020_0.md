| 0:04:12| been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| So do we want to move it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| end of the agenda or do we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| to just postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=256)|

| 0:04:20| Mrs. Peele's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| Do you want to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| question smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| The the owner has not been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| for fingerprints or background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| checks at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=270)|
| 0:04:30| So it seems to me that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| I'm trying to recall when that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| was postponed from the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Exactly what the discussion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| but there was some rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| for this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| Well I don't know much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| I can't add much but we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| been told verbally that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| want to withdraw this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Well I guess that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I was trying to remember that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| have not heard from from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=303)|
| 0:05:03| So I guess the most prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| thing to do would the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| check in the packet dates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| last July and I know that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| first time they came before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| but at least we know that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| when that's when they opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| when they were in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| of opening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| So that I think that dates back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| to the original and his intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| may not be to incorporate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| into his business plan but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| are open and they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| successfully working and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| apparently there's no one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| Yeah I withdraw the motion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| then make a substitute motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| postpone it for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| scheduled beer board meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| we can maybe try to find out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| little bit more between now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Would it is it ever appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| for us to contact the owner and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| We'll be glad to indicate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| council has asked for a formal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Yes if that's his intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=370)|
| 0:06:10| We didn't call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=370)|

| 0:06:14| you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| I think can we amend your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| to say that they are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=378)|

| 0:22:00| Henderson Willis, 7121 Bull Run Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration, the LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| and it's a certificate of zoning from MPC, building inspector approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| fire inspector approval, health department approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| task program certification, and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Well, I may embarrass myself again, but I'm going to ask you where you're locating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| It's right beside Greens Military on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| And this is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| You have not been through the task program yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| I have been, and this is my copy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| And you brought the certificate to see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Can you show it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| I'm going to eyeball it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1370)|
| 0:23:01| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| And I have another question for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| What is your planned opening date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Currently we do not have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Our landlord is talking to the current tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| They're trying to work out a deal for the current tenant's back rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| so we're really not sure whether or not we're going to get the building or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| So we wanted to proceed with this, get this in line in case we were able to take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| over the building and move on in as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| So we currently do not have an opening date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| We're just trying to get everything in line in case that happens so we can proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| And you still have all these inspections that will be required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| We will do that prior to opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| I'd be open for comment or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| You have a great deal to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| Approximately when do you think you're going to try to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Well, our goal actually was to open tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| But within the last week, we have found out that the landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| or actually the liaison for the landlord has gotten in contact with the current tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| and they've started negotiations with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| So we've been kind of, you know, in limbo since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| So you're saying his lease has not been completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| The lease has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| It was on a month-to-month-to-month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| But he has not met his obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| So now they're in negotiations on trying to get that back online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| So we're kind of up in the air, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| Is the current tenant still operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| They're selling beer tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Are legal counsel making corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| But we can't issue two permits at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| And what do you know about his?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Well, one would replace the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| but before he can get a permit, the other one has to be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| Well, one has to be terminated, but we've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Yeah, I mean, it can't be formalized until it's terminated, but we could vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| So that would come within the pending documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Scope of that, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Well, I realize you're in a difficult situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1527)|
| 0:25:36| Well, if you give him one, the other one goes away, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Not until they turn it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Not until they have surrendered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| We have been in that situation before, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| where somebody doesn't want to turn it in, they want to keep operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| I don't think Ms. Martin would issue their permit until that one has been turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| So the people that are operating, I'm familiar with the Rainbow Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| I don't eat raw fish there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| I know where you're located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| So I'm thinking, the permit holder now, has he been located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1570)|
| 0:26:21| By the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| And is he actually running the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| To my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Responsible for the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| We're not purchasing anything from the current tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| This is just a new venture upon ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| So to be honest with you, I'm not really for sure what's going on with the current tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| I can't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| Well, let's throw it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| We'll float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| We'll just float it out there and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| I'll move approval pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| which also includes, hopefully, the surrender of the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| but certainly some certification of the surrender of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Mr. Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Yeah, I wanted to ask Ms. Martin or Ms. Day about the things that are missing are the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| The inspections, corporate documents, sales tax registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| And the certificate of zoning, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| The certificate of zoning, is that something that somebody in an office up on the fourth floor just has to look up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| So that's a pretty simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| They provide a certified state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| And all the health department, fire, those are actual inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| So at some level, he's going to have to take ownership of the property, schedule an inspection, get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| And that's the problem until he is given the keys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| and can actually use the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| He can't get those inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| So that's the reason I make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Give you that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| As far as the other paperwork, we do have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| My business partner is under the weather today and was unable to fax those to Ms. Wanda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| but we do have that other paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| That'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I guess we can see if we get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| If we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| We've already got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Ms. Mark, did I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| Yeah, there is an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| The 501 Arthur Street Market in Delhi, which has come before you several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| is back on the agenda for some continuation of time so they can complete their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| And we've extended this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Oh, I'm sorry, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| We've extended this twice, correct, for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| You know, the first time this came before us, and this is Mike Elliott, the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| and 501 Arthur is a restaurant, actually, in my neighborhood in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| And when it first came before us, there was some confusion about something about it being in a historic district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| which is not relevant at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| What is relevant is that the owners before Mike Elliott had an off-premise beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1766)|
| 0:29:35| and he wants to serve on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| So there needs to be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| In between these two 30-day extensions, I jumped in and tried to figure out how to help Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1784)|
| 0:29:53| and we went and talked to Mark Donaldson, and, indeed, that's the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| I did also want to say this before I ask you what I want to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| This is a very important little restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| In my community, Mechanicsville, we are actually struggling with a lot of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| The last city council meeting we had, there was a big meeting at Clinton Chapel about the kind of upsurge of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1817)|
| 0:30:31| Several days before that city council meeting, behind my street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| there was somebody who unloaded 15 rounds of 9-millimeter in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| And so there is a lot of struggle in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| And this restaurant is a bright light in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Hires from the community, people come to the restaurant from outside the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| and are looking at our homes to buy, so nothing but good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| We have community meetings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| So did you want to add anything, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| I was reminded today when you stopped by the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| I had some friends stop in from Colorado who had been around my previous restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| and it reminded me of where I started with there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| And not that you would be aware of it or it makes much of a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| but the restaurants I've opened are on par with anything in the world, and that's not an exaggeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1883)|
| 0:31:32| And to come before you, you know, I saw this building where I am, and it's an exceptional building now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| When I bought it, it was not an exceptional building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| And this is an empowerment zone, and it was one of their goals was to change this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| And some of these buildings were important, and this is one they considered very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| And I think I've done it better than I think anyone else would have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| And part of being successful in the restaurant business, in my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| is to be able to provide all the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| And for me, I would like to have a full liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| When I came before you first, though, we talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| and there was a lot of confusion on your part as far as what your options were and what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| And we're talking about a beer license in a place that had served beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| but it got talked about and tossed around jokingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| And this is my livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| This is how I make my living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| And, Joe Bailey, I appreciate you in particular, because I've never met you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| But at each meeting, you stood up and you said, what can we do for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| And we didn't come up with satisfactory answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| We went to the legal counsel and said what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| And he said we could postpone it or we can reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| And that is not the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| You also had another option, and you could bring it before the counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| and make a resolution to waive that $1,000 fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| It's something that you would not want to do to set a precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| But at the same time, this has been three years of restoration in a very difficult area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| When I started, everyone said you can't do that in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| You can't open the best restaurant in Knoxville in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| People will not come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| And that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| The Sentinel has already substantiated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| All the articles have been written, and they've all been very, very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Yeah, and so it's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| So the question is, I think what we need is another postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| but I also wanted to ask this counsel your feelings or your interest or agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| If I introduced a resolution to waive the $1,000 fee, which he does not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| is that something that you could agree to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| In my mind, there's some legitimacy around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| because it further increases the viability of the enterprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| in a community that really needs this enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| And I don't necessarily feel like it's going to open the floodgates for such practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| So may I hear some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Could I interject one more thing that happened simultaneous to the beer board debacle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| I had asked for a business expansion loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| I talked to community development about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| and they encouraged me to go for something that would have solved a lot of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| And they sent me through two months of a lot of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| getting architectural drawings and a lot of things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| And then I went before their board, and the decision makers weren't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| and they told me I didn't qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| And that, for a small businessman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| I don't have time to be running around, you know, getting architectural drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| and doing a lot of monkey business and to have somebody tell me I don't even qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| when they had plenty of options to show me along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Well, that was frustrating, and, you know, I'm sorry that that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| So back to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Dr. Mayerbecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| I think this is a use on review fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Yeah, I mean, I think we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I would definitely support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I also think that, in a funny way, that the way we do fees like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| discourage people from doing innovative projects like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| I mean, it's a very – structurally, it's not a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| But, yeah, short-term, that makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| Councilman Rawley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| I'd like to thank Councilman Woodhull for doing the research on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| and working with this business center to try to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| I think I could support that resolution, particularly if –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| and despite, I apologize for your recent disappointment with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Department of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| I'm sorry that that happened on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| But perhaps in working with Ms. Rojara, there could be some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| incorporated into that as to the empowerment zone designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| and how this building was singled out in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| In the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Yeah, in the resolution and the importance of this particular structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| as singled out in that study of this fragile area, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| and why it was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| And I've been to your restaurant and had the tomato soup, and it's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| I think my wife was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| I'll just go ahead and comment because I'm glad to see you before us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| I really appreciate, Councilman Woodhull, the work you've done in regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| And I was aware of your interest and passion for making this work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| When you were here before and you referred to it as the debacle, I felt it was too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| And I guess I didn't, you know, blow the trumpet like Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| But I was very frustrated because I felt that we were not actually dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| with the situation that we were dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| I thought that we were trying to be too difficult about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| which I saw to be a very positive thing for that area, that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| And I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| And it costs money to have patience when you're trying to do what you've been trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| So I personally just morally, because of the way that was handled that evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2245)|
| 0:37:33| I definitely would support that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| And I think it's absolutely incumbent upon us when we have erred to make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| And I hate to say it, but probably our legal counsel will shoot me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| but I felt very strongly the night that we erred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| And I appreciate your understanding that sometimes that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| I haven't been to your restaurant yet, but it sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| But let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| I clearly remember the overlay issue that we had before in different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| If we get to the point where the proposed resolution comes on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| and passes, you know, part of the reason, I assume, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| you want to sell beer and sell liquor is to make it more attractive to patrons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| and hopefully help your bottom line out as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| I mean, is it something where you'd consider, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| if everything works out to make payments towards that waived fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| I mean, I don't mean to be crass or anything, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| I'm just trying to think of, you know, is it possible, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| Of course it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Just my thoughts on it a little bit is if that would have been decided six months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| or whenever I began, but this is about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| I mean, it's a struggle to make, you know, a business run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| especially when we're in the midst of an economic downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| When I opened up, it was about the bottom of the barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| And everything, you know, it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| And for me, to be able to open a bottle of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| and have it be worth about an hour's worth of work for me prepping meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| I mean, it's an important aspect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| It's not I don't want to be a bar, that's not what I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Could I make payments toward it in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Of course I could because I plan on being successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| Would I rather not at this point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Yes, I would rather not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| But if that's the way you guys put it to me, I'll do whatever you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| I guess just my general concern, and I don't mean I'm talking about future people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| in somewhat similar circumstances where, I mean, this might come out wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| and I'm trying to be polite, don't get me wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| but if we do have a large influx of people, you know, looking for waivers with excuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2404)|
| 0:40:12| or with reasons that are adequate or maybe not as adequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| and then all of a sudden, you know, there are implications to bottom lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| for different city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| I'm not saying you have to agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| That's just kind of where I'm coming from, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| No, I understand completely what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| But I would hope that you don't get put in this situation again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| that I hope that you're able to handle the situations of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| Because really the big problem here is there was just so much confusion from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| that I don't think really should have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Somehow this should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| We should have known the answer to these questions the very first time I came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Yeah, but we're resolving it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Well, I don't know all the details, but from what I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| and from what I've heard so far, I will definitely support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| I will say that the use on review fee goes to the MPC, and there is a funding issue there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| and we're going to hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| It goes beyond just offsetting a fee here and there, which we basically almost never do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| But, you know, we need to keep in mind how we're going to fund the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| which I think they can make an argument that they're underfunded as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| But having said that, this is an extraordinary situation, and I will support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2491)|
| 0:41:40| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| I, too, will support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| I've been to his place more than once, and I know he has put a lot of resources into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2504)|
| 0:41:52| Not only has he done that with his restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| he has restored one of the most historic houses in Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| where a counselor who was a principal of Austin High School for over 30 years lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| And any time a famous black person like Booker T. Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| or anybody came to this town who couldn't stay in a hotel stayed in that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| So I don't think you got the best from us the first time you were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| and I would certainly hope that we can remedy that situation with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| Councilman Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| I would surely echo those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Thank you, Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| My concern is that that needs to be done immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| because some of us who are a part of that decision will not be on this council long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2565)|
| 0:42:54| and I would love to see that rectified prior to our dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| I'll move as quickly as we can move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| May I say one more thing, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| As I look at Mechanicsville, this is one of the very, very few places in Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2589)|
| 0:43:18| that would be able to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| There are churches on almost every corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| There are 15 churches in Mechanicsville proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| and it is very difficult to find a place beyond 300 feet of a church to get a beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2608)|
| 0:43:36| and he certainly has a good spot where he can do it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| I guess the first order of business is I move for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| It's actually an extension of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Extension of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| You need to say how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I can still forward the resolution at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Briefly, before we recess, if someone from the Metropolitan Drug Commission would like to come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| I believe our Executive Director, Katherine Brunson, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Each of the beer board members was provided this evening a packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| and this is similar or exactly what we give to our vendors when they receive a new beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| and you can see the buttons here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I noticed those lovely buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Ms. Brunson, would you like to tell us more about this packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| Just very briefly, what you're getting is what Ms. Day provides to the new permit holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| and what we've tried to assemble is just, with restaurant input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| some materials that might help them in reducing underage sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| that might help them with tips on checking IDs and just preventing those sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| I believe at the last meeting you all had requested some information around strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| and tips that we could provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| and we wanted you to know that this is what we provide very gratefully with our support from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| The materials run about $17 a bag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| so I will ask that when you are done looking at them, if you would not like to hang them in your closet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| if you would pass those to Ms. Day so that she could provide those to future new permit holders in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| I will add, if you have a new permit holder in your district that you would like to personally deliver this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| in addition, I'm sure they can always use more buttons and more of the stickers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| there's a couple things I would like to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| One is this board did ask for tips on responsible service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| and Officer Husky emailed to you this list today, and it's also in hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| That's separate from the Beer Board packet, so do take note of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| because we struggled with how to advise permittees when they come in and they've had a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| and they're looking for ways in their remediation plan to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| so these are some tips they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| In the packet are tips for vendors for checking fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| The Metropolitan Drug Commission is going to be making an effort to provide more of our materials in Spanish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| so you can see these, and if you don't speak Spanish, you can see what it says in English here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| and we have some posters and buttons and all kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| so it's a great packet and hopefully gets new permit holders started on the right foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| and we're pleased to have the city support some of the city's funding that comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| The Metropolitan Drug Commission is used in our partnership with the Beer Board to provide these packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| And anyone is welcome to call our office and get any of the materials free at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| The tips that you're receiving are also returned into a remedial letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| When we hear when the compliance comes down that someone has failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| we send them a letter offering them tips and strategies of how they can prevent them in the future as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| so there's repetition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2824)|

| 0:47:12| La hostica?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2832)|
| 0:47:35| Could you give us your name and address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| Ramon Martinez, 2525 Chumaw Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| Officer Heskey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| They do have their tax certificate, so they're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| We're just waiting on the final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| I'll make a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2884)|

| 0:48:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| I think we should say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| Did the other one happen to come back yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2897)|

| 0:48:38| Officer Heskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Do you know Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| They do have their tax certificate, and we are waiting still on a copy of the corporate charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| and approval from the building inspector and fire inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| The building inspection and fire inspection is pending upon receiving a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| because the current owner right now is not going to make changes to the building unless we get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| Move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2944)|

| 0:49:17| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091020?start=2960)|
