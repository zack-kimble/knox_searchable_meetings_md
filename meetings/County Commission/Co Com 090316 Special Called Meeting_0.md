| 0:02:02| responsibilities. There was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| added a subsection M. which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=126)|

| 0:02:25| operate as a nonprofit. Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| eight. Is a section that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| captioned assignment and sub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| letting. And. It's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| understanding. The way- this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| drafted. And I'll point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| there are two leases that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| attached to the resolution. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| I attached the two leases. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| first one provides that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| lessee shall be allowed to sub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| let. Without the prior written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| consent and approval of less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| so. Then it goes on to describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| the provision that. If the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| lessee does sub let any portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| of the premises. Then Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| County will be entitled to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| receive 15% of any amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| collected in excess of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| hundred thousand dollars per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| month. In section. Fifteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=216)|
| 0:03:46| That's the termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| provision. And that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| modified to provide that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| can be at least can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| terminated for cause. And cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| is described as a breach. Of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| the lease of the terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| lease agreement. The reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| there are two leases attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| and the only difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| the two. Is that in one. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| provides what I read a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| ago regarding sub letting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| that is that the premises can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| be sub let. Without. Prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| approval of the county. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| second. Provides. That. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| county approve. The sub less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| soar. Which consent shall not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| be unreasonably withheld. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| discussing in reviewing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| with Hillcrest it just occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| to me that since this is Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| County property. That it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| appropriate that Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Have the discretion. To approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| or not approve. Whoever or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| whatever entity is leasing Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| County's property. I attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| both leases. So that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| commission could do whatever it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| felt. Was prudent. And the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| in it the best business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| judgment according to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| commission. I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| that. If you do opt for. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| allowing sub letting. Unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| the county approve the sub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| less soar. That it. It not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| required that it come back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| The full commission because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| the time element. That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| discussed at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| and apparently. That could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| cause a problem. For Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| in the event that it does have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| a. A sub tenant. I would I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| open to suggestions about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| it would could be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| either it could be. A committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| composed of perhaps. The mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| the chair of commission and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| chair of the two standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| committees. Who would approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| it in writing. But in any event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| those are the changes that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| been made. And. All of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| changes that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| requested at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| Are in. The draft the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| difference. Between the two. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| the one. Allows Hillcrest to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| sub let without prior approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| the other requires prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| approval of the sub tenant. Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| there any questions commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Pinkston. Mister Lockett. You've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| got that just so they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| sublease the buildings what if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| they want to. Sublease one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| these facilities that are using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| right now for a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| They've got three that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| they've actually got five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| buildings. Three of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| used to house patients. Now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=435)|

| 0:07:23| to you the legal thing that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| in the paper the twenty third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Where the state is about to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| close and I don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| the paper this morning said they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| had that straight now and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| don't know whether or not. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| what if this closes wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=455)|

| 0:07:39| to another nursing home. Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| whatever. And our patients are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| out in the cold. As I said the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| way it's currently drafted. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| that. There's two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=474)|

| 0:08:06| anyone. That they want without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| the county having a say. Or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=489)|

| 0:11:39| there's not any confusion in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| this. I believe that if they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=701)|

| 0:11:47| nursing home to another entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=707)|

| 0:11:51| through the certificate of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| with the state so it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| wouldn't happen. The second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| thing is these federal one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| through five star ratings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| came out a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| that received a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| publicity. In the press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| shouldn't be confused with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| patients being put in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=726)|

| 0:12:16| that also on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=736)|

| 0:12:26| against one of the nursing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| homes. I guess it was about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| month ago right after our past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| meeting dealt with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| laboratory tests that weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| relayed to the physicians or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| weren't obtained the way they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| were ordered in a timely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| fashion. The health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| department's been back. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| say that the process where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| this was missed has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| corrected and those sanctions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| have now been removed so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| there's no threat of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| barring admission. One other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| statement that this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=775)|

| 0:12:58| there to protect the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| isn't exactly accurate because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| it is the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| responsibility as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| CMS's to protect the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| and they have very regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| and rigid inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| requirements and these are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| ones that picked up those lab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| tests that involved some nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| of 500 patients. I think if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| was just the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| going out there is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| wouldn't know what to look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| really how to properly do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| inspection so I really have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| lot of faith that the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Department of Health can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| this. I would also like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| point out and I don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| original article. I was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| to pull it up quickly here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| the Knoxville news sentinel but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| it was a very large percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| of the nursing homes in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=823)|

| 0:13:47| this one to five star rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| and even if you go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| website which I did several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| weeks ago and look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| they were saying it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| necessarily mean that patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=837)|

| 0:14:01| relative to the ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| situation, they didn't meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| mark on those and actually I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| think the only ones in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=849)|

| 0:14:17| star rating even the one at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| of the other hospital systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| where you have physicians there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| all the time and the full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| hospital staff and the full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| support of their x-ray and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| laboratory departments was only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| average at one of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| hospitals but I won't mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| any names on those so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| that it is significant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| they did not pass one of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| tests back in January or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| February that they were put on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| I'll call it probation but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| department of health was back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| last week and they passed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| so they're back to their full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| certification to admit patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| and do whatever and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| So Mr. Law Director, when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| fail an inspection by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| or the federal government like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| they did about a month or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| ago, that would be a four cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| reason to terminate this lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| If it's determined that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| have not been in compliance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| a applicable state or federal regulation, yes, that would constitute cause under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| terms of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| There is a cure provision, as there is in any lease, so that if they were given notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| of a breach, then they would have the right in a specified time period, which under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| terms of the lease is 90 days, to cure any deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| So if this were to happen again in the future, then that could be something that would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| before commission to either terminate the lease or to at least put them on this probationary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=960)|
| 0:16:09| period that they have to cure the forecast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| The other thing you brought up with sub-leasing property, I do believe that needs to be written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=978)|
| 0:16:29| up to where it would need to come back before commission for the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| We're the government that is charged with authorizing contracts, and I think it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=996)|
| 0:16:46| come back before commission before they sub-lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| This would not be a contract really with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| A sub-lease would be a contract between Hillcrest and the sub-tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1018)|
| 0:17:07| It would not be a contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| About as far as liability, since it's our building, would we still not be liable if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| say, an accident or something were to happen at this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| Well, by contract, under the terms of this lease, Hillcrest is responsible for the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| and to maintain liability insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| All of those things are to be in place under the terms of the lease, or that would constitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| a breach of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| If they have the sole power to lease it to whomever, could they lease it to anybody for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1064)|
| 0:17:53| any reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Or is there certain parameters that they'd have to stick to, like a health type of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1075)|
| 0:18:04| Are there any parameters there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| It was my understanding from the discussions at the prior meeting that they had some space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| that could be used as office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| Under the way this is drafted, if you pass a resolution approving the lease that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1101)|
| 0:18:32| not require coming back and getting approval of the subtenant, then there's no parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| As Commissioner Briggs mentioned, there are practical limitations, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| Well, the building that's not being used as a nursing home, then you don't need a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| If they wanted to lease it to a doctor or to another health care facility or organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1137)|
| 0:19:07| they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| But what if they wanted to lease it out to any other type of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| Could they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Ms. Poynter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Carol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| If, in your estimation, how much do you think you could sublease all the space out for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1161)|
| 0:19:34| Carolyn, I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| Carolyn Poynter, 1978 Cherokee Bluff Drive, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| Commissioner Leuthold, I have not done a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Currently, there are about 25,000 square feet on two floors in the corporate building that are vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1188)|
| 0:19:56| That would be our first review, and it would be at market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| Whether it would be for warehousing, that's one rate, or whether it would be for actual office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| it would be a different rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| But I have not done a calculation as to the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Do you think it's realistic that you would ever receive more than $100,000 in a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1212)|
| 0:20:22| Not in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Only if we vacated additional floors in that building and had additional space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| And you don't foresee that happening, and I don't foresee that happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| if you're going to continue being a viable business, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| With some managerial changes assumed, there could be some consolidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| But to what extent at this point in time, I wouldn't think it would be considerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| So the clause in there for the county to receive maybe some funds back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| if the sublease came in more than $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| you really don't see that as money coming back to Knox County, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| Well, that would be a great problem for us to have, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| We'd love for that to happen so we could give some of that money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| But today I can't tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I don't want to disagree with Mr. Briggs because I didn't check across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| but I certainly checked in Knox County, Tennessee, which I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Out of the 24 nursing homes here in Knox County, six of them are rated much below average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| Three of those are Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| As far as the deficiencies, these things there, I didn't rate these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| The federal government rated them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Number four says that the people are in immediate jeopardy to their health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1306)|
| 0:21:55| North has 12 number fours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| They've got three number threes, which is minimum danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| West, you know, I don't know whether they're going to be closed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| All I could get out of the paper this morning was that they had submitted a plan to the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| and they had approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| But it doesn't say that they're going to get in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| We have to take care of these patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Now, there are jeopardies because the federal government says so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| I don't go out there and check them like Commissioner Briggs says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Neither does any person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| He may be the one who could check them better than anybody here being a doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| but the government says these people are in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Not Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| The government says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| These things need to be taken care of, and that should be just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| When the taxpayers in Knox County are subsidizing them $2 million or more a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| our citizens deserve better health care than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| That should be just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| And like I say, Commissioner Briggs, I didn't check across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| but here in Knox County, 24 nursing homes within 25 miles of where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| six of them are rated much below average by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| Three of those are Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| Now, I gave you a paper there showing some of the jeopardies there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| and in that, that's membersofthefamily.net,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| it says the 12th and 19th of 08 that Hillcrest North was put on the watch list also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1410)|
| 0:23:40| Now, all I can say is our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| and the patients in Hillcrest deserve better health care than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| and that should be just cause if they don't get this corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| Yes, I was still trying to pull this up on how we rate in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| I think the key word is that they were on probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| They last Thursday, I believe it was, the government came back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| and they said there are no deficiencies at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| And what's going to happen, and I know this from dealing with hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| it's just like when the health department comes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| It's very rare for someone to get 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| I think it's on the radio stations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Every week, you know, they list some of the health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| A lot of the very good places are 93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| They'll still have deficiencies, and they have to correct those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| And it's the same thing with these hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| It's the same thing with nursing homes is that they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| they say they have areas that are very important that need to be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| but they came in last week, say they're corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Now they're saying there are no problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| And, you know, I do agree if they have recurrent problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| it's not for us to stop it because the state will stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| And that's the point I'm trying to make is that the patients aren't in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| They were inspected last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| They said there's no problems now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| What was the problem was fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| They'll come back, they'll find something else at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| and they'll say you've got to fix these things, and they'll either fix them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| or they'll lose their ability to receive Medicaid dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| So I'm not quite as concerned about that because I trust the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| and I trust the health inspectors to tell us if there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1517)|
| 0:25:26| I guess I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I'd like to ask Ms. Poynter a question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| Ms. Poynter, has the state reached an agreement with you on accepting your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| Not only have they accepted the plan, as Commissioner Briggs stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| they returned on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| All deficiencies at all of our facilities are cleared, including West's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| You have documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| I would like for you to get some of that to me as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| With respect to the Exhibit A and Exhibit B that's been brought to us by the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| I'm looking at page five of Exhibit B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| and Exhibit B is the one that would require them to get our written authorization before subleasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1573)|
| 0:26:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Then prior to us deciding what we're doing with this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| we either have to accept A or B, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| I would submit or I move that the Exhibit B be the one that would be used in our lease arrangement with Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1592)|
| 0:26:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| And I also ask if there is other verbiage that we need to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| You were discussing should we form a committee or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| The question is if you're going to require that Hillcrest obtain prior written approval of a subtenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1615)|
| 0:27:05| do they have to come back to the full commission or with the obvious time constraint that that imposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1625)|
| 0:27:16| or would this commission create a committee that would allow them to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1636)|
| 0:27:26| and obtain written approval of the subtenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| Keeping in mind that if you decide to allow Hillcrest to sublet what you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1651)|
| 0:27:43| all you're talking about is the subtenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| So, you know, you could do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| It's up to this body to decide what it thinks best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| So would it be appropriate that the chairman of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| and four other commissioners would make a sufficient committee to review such written request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1680)|
| 0:28:10| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| I did ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I think that you could do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| It would, I think in that instance, to be on the safe side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| you'd probably want to publicly notice a meeting for that purpose if it was comprised of two or more commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1707)|
| 0:28:40| Yes, that would be normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Should someone from the executive branch of Knox County government be included in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| I think that would be appropriate, that it be a combination of the executive and the legislative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1731)|
| 0:29:00| Yes, and someone from the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| Again, though, keep in mind what you're doing is approving the tenant, not the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| This is a sublease between Hillcrest and that tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| So all you're doing is they're coming back and saying we'd like to sublet to whoever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| and then you have the option to approve that subtenant with standard language that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1762)|
| 0:29:33| that the consent will not be unreasonably withheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| So I'm in favor still of having a five-person group, the chairman of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| two commissioners, an appointee of the mayor, and someone from purchasing, five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| Make that a part of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| I guess we have a motion that's properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| We can go ahead and select the people at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Can we just go ahead and make it the chairman of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| and the two chairmen of the intergovernmental and finance and the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| I accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| And the head of the purchasing department, whoever it may be at whatever particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1819)|
| 0:30:28| Commissioner Lutho, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I'm just speaking to that I prefer the commission be in the approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| but I prefer it to be the whole commission and the reason that time constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| I don't think that they're going to strike a deal and expect it to happen in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| and I just wish that it would come before full commission instead of a committee of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| I know that back last month when we were discussing possibly receiving a percentage of rents collected at these subleases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1859)|
| 0:31:09| and a number was thrown out there of $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| And I don't know that the commission at that time had any idea of how much space was out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| or how much they could possibly be bringing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| And I would like to see that figure move from $100,000 down to $25,000, anything above $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| She said she had about $25,000 or 25,000 square foot of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| That gives them a dollar per square foot to lease out before they even start to begin to pay Knox County anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| And they're still keeping 85% above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| We're allowing them to come in with a partnership, what it looks like, to infuse a lot of money, millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1908)|
| 0:31:58| I don't expect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Even if it's a nonprofit, I still think you're not going to have an entity come in, invest millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| and expect only goodwill back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| And I think we need to take a look at, especially during these times of budget crunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| that when we have an asset like this, we need to be receiving back something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| To expect Knox County to receive anything above $100,000 is just putting our head in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1942)|
| 0:32:31| And I think it's reasonable that if they're going to go out and bring in an investor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| that Knox County should at that time receive some type of funds back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| I just don't see that as being too much to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| Mr. Chairman, there's a motion on the floor, and I think Chairman Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| I would ask if you could add that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Well, then I'll ask if we could make that as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| What I was going to ask for, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| We're deciding on Exhibit A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| If there needs to be another motion come at a later time about amending the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| it might be more appropriate at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| We do have a motion on the floor, and I'm hearing a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| I don't know if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| I guess I'm making a substitute motion that we do B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| The only change that I have, different from Commissioner Wright, is moving the $100,000 down to $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| And I still don't see that as bringing in a whole lot of money to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| I don't see that as hurting Hillcrest in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| But I think it is something that when you have another entity that's willing to invest millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2028)|
| 0:33:57| and to think that they're only expecting goodwill back, I think that's far-fetched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2037)|
| 0:34:06| They're expecting to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| And if you have an entity out there trying to make a profit off of Knox County assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| then I think Knox County should receive at least some payment back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Is there a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| I'll second that, Commissioner Lutho, because nonprofits do make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| I just want to put this in perspective of something that I have on the agenda for the full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2069)|
| 0:34:37| which is that in 10 years our senior population in Knox County is going to double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| Hillcrest needs every dollar it can get right now to get ready for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090316specialcalledmeeting?start=2083)|
