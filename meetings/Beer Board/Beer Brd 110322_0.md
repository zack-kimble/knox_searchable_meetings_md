| 0:09:59| Well, you know, it was a hard-fought decision to a certain degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| You know, we've been where we are for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| It's an 80-year-old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| We have an opportunity to move into a building that's about seven and a half years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| It's going to cut some of our overhead, maintenance, utility costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| And in general, the middle of the strip seems to be, you know, revenue-wise, a better stream of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| We're kind of Lone Ranger down the other end, and we feel like it's going to help us in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=623)|

| 0:10:39| And after 430, we're going to have 28 spaces every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| The bank closes at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| It's going to be a little tough for lunch, but Saturday, Sunday, wide open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=645)|

| 0:11:35| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Charles, could you clarify in terms of what's listed on here as far as other information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| in terms of unpaid fines and a DUI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| Does that have any bearing on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| The DUI is not one of the offense listed as a disqualifying offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| The unpaid fines, we are not given the authority to deny a beer permit because persons have unpaid fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| There's some thought that that would be a good thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| but until the state legislature authorizes us to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| then we cannot withhold a beer permit because of unpaid fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| We could for an unpaid application fee, but that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| But we could encourage you to get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Mr. Chairman, there's one entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| I don't know the significance of it under Mr. Talbot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=741)|

| 0:16:52| and we gave them a 30-day extension to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| So they're here to ask for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1019)|

| 0:17:17| My work is little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Can you tell us what the nature of the delay is this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Is it related to construction or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| No, just little bit work, not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Both of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Some of the work and the person who was supposed to be here is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| He's in New York, so he's going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| So you want a 60-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| What's the date for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1060)|

| 0:17:52| Extend it until May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| That's a proper motion, and it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| All those in favor of the extension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1081)|

| 0:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Are you running into problems with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Dewar said another two weeks before they're finished, at least with construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| So that will be until the, I know you told me, April 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1111)|
| 0:18:40| That's the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Councilman, do you have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| That old line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| There's been a motion properly seconded for a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| All those in favor of the extension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| Kristen Ferber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| The address is 513 Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| And we need an extension until the April 19th meeting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| We have passed our final plumbing and electrical inspections, so we're very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Until the April 19th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1165)|

| 0:19:29| All those in favor of the extension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Mandarin Palace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1174)|
| 0:19:43| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| I didn't realize that they wouldn't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| I know they've been working on that HVAC system that's tied into the mall, and that's given them a heartache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| I don't know what to say in terms of if DOTI had any contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| Did they call you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Well, I'll move that we extend it for 30 days, and I'll take it upon myself to contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| That's a motion and second to the April 19th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| April 19th, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| An extension until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| And seeing no further last, all those in favor of the extension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| We've got a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| On the next item, the request from the Dogwood Arts Festival, whenever you approve a special events permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| you approve it including all of the elements of that permit that they have listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| because they have to provide a plan to the police department and all other affected city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| about how they're going to conduct their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| And they have done that and had done it previous to your approval of their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| They now have decided that they would prefer to have, it sounds like, some extended hours on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| And so they are asking for an amendment to their beer permit, which would allow those extended hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| And I guess, really, that would impact primarily the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| And I don't know if the sergeant has any comment on that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| We do not have any objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| I've been asked to serve on the board with the Dogwood Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Would it be wise for me not to vote on it, or what would you advise on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| Would it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| I don't think it really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| If you want to wear suspenders and a belt and be very, very cautious, you could just recuse yourself from that vote if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| I'll just recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Because you don't have a real financial interest in it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Well, I'll just recuse myself anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| I was just looking at the March 17th letter with the new times and hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| These are obviously weekend events, and the hours seem reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| The latest is 10 p.m., so it looks like a good opportunity for our festival and a public gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| So I think we should approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| I would move that we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| There's a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| I do not see any lights, so I want to assume that that is a done deal if everybody says yes, except the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Is there any further business to come before this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Anybody wanting to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110322?start=1355)|
