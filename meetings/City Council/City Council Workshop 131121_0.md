| 0:00:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=29)|
| 0:00:30| Let's stand for 30 seconds of silence or a minute of silence, I guess, and then Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| Brown will lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=35)|
| 0:00:36| We place the flag and salute and pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=38)|
| 0:00:39| We place the flag and salute and pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=39)|
| 0:00:52| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=52)|
| 0:00:58| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=58)|
| 0:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| We have essentially four items on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| What happens when a referral goes to the hearing officer from the VEER Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| Today several of us met with TABC, and they will talk about our compliance with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=76)|
| 0:01:23| and then we'll do a little consensus building to try to come to some kind of a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| about when we should defer an action or approve pending, and then there's a revised special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| event application for us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| So the first order of business will be Allison and Cindy, and they're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| what happens when a referral goes to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| And I did send you the Whiskey Dicks paperwork, and I think they may talk about that, or they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| may just refer to this sheet with the blue lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| I'm Allison Eberting with the City Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Most of us know each other, and it's good to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| Cindy Mitchell is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| I thought we might just go through the process with you, and then we're both available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| I did provide you a flowchart today, if you have a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| It pretty much streamlines what we do from the VEER Board all the way through the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| If you'll first look at the non-ABC flowchart, that's our standard procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| When you all get a case, for example, when you have a situation where a permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| has made two sales to an underage, they're going to come before you at an administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| hearing, and that's under 4-78 of our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| Cindy Mitchell sends them a notice letter, and then they appear at the hearing before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| you, and then you all are making a decision at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Do you think that there should be more punishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Is this a time for a warning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Do we defer things, or do we send them to a hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| If you send them to a hearing, the law department takes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| We file a complaint, and we file it with the city recorder's office, just like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| file a complaint in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| They're given notice of an appointment of a hearing officer, and then we have a scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| At that point in time, it's very similar to a mini-trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| Sometimes we can agree, and we'll go through that process, and we'll enter an agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| Sometimes we don't agree, and so we'll have an actual hearing where witnesses are called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| and that's where Tracy Hunter helps us, because her officers are often the witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| And so that's the process that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| One of the things that you'll see, and what Ms. Palmer emailed to you, I guess, a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| days ago, is a sample complaint, and a sample answer, and that kind of thing, and so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| looks very much like a lawsuit at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| The only difference between our process and the ABC process is that the ABC process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| covered under the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| It doesn't give us a whole lot of leniency with regard to the steps that we have to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| When we receive a certified letter from the ABC saying that they have suspended or revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| a permit, we are required by law to send it to the next regularly scheduled beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| And you all have seen some of those come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| I think there's been a little bit of discussion about, well, we just saw them last month or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Why is it back before us again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| The reason for that is because of the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| And at that point in time, it's very much by rote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| You all have to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| You have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Did a violation occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| And if that did happen, there has to be a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| At that point, it's just like the other hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| I file a complaint, we appoint a hearing officer, and we have a trial if they contest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| So far, most of those folks have entered into agreed orders for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| It's been a pretty smooth process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Any questions so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Cindy, do you have anything you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| That's in a nutshell what our process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| I hope that if you all have concerns or any confusion about the process, this will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| But we're always available up in the law department if you ever need to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| So, let's say you get a citation, a violation, and we know that it goes to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=316)|
| 0:05:25| Can we delay having our hearing and wait until we get the hearing and then just have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| bind them, or do you automatically just have to hear it when it comes to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| When the certified letter comes to us is when we have to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Sometimes we will have a violation, and it's our second violation, and the problem is we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| usually ahead of the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| They might be working on their process, and they might have a situation where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| going to hold a hearing, but as, and Ms. Palmer can speak to this too, as we were told today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| by the ABC, it sometimes takes three to six months for them to process their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| So usually, we've already sent them the notice letter about the second violation, and they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| already come to us for an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| We work with them as best we can, and in fact, we have worked with them on a couple cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| since this law was passed to try to make things go concurrently, but it's very difficult just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| because of how the timing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| We're required to have that hearing in a certain amount of time upon receiving notice, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| we can't delay it until, to run it concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Ms. Mitchell, did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| I think, you know, Allison answered that perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| It's just that a lot of times, George, we don't even know if the TABC, when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| involved, you know, by the time we get the citation notice and we send our letters out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| we don't know if they're involved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| One other thing to add, and then I'll call on you, Mr. Delaveau, none of this happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| We live in an instant world where we think, well, you get the violation, you get the penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| tomorrow, you do whatever it is, and then it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| But this, there has to be X amount of days between each step for people to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| And for me, that's very frustrating, but that's the way the law works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| I was just trying to get it where you're concurrently, and you wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| That is an issue that we talked about today, and TABC does not, and the intent of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| was not that the penalties be served concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| The other side of that coin is, let's suppose that you have a suspension by TABC, so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| can't serve liquor during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| But we haven't acted because we got the information late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| So you can still be open and serve beer, so your revenue stream is not totally stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| And then when the beer license is suspended for X days, then you can be serving the liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| So you do have a revenue stream if they're not concurrent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| If they're concurrent, then that works differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Another thing that we asked about today, and I think Mr. Frost asked this, sometimes we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| will see that somebody's license has been suspended a total of 10 days, but it's three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| days here, three days there, and three days someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| That's because the suspensions now occur only on the days the business is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| And we have some businesses that are only open on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| So if their license is suspended, it will only be suspended on those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| And so that's why it looks kind of odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I'm going to be sending you one this afternoon later that will look very odd, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| Could you just, you've sort of hit upon it in two or three areas with questions and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| Could you speak again, this microphone's not working, speak again about that, we had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| awkward phase where it seemed like in coordinating with the state that we were almost having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| like double jeopardy for some of these people who were coming in here, and they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| already had a hearing, and it would seem to be almost the same transaction, but we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| that state statute and pilot plan that said we had to coordinate and sort of follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| But it was very awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Some of the people said, I've already been to the hearing, I've already sort of done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| my time, and now we're saying, fine, now go to the city hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| I can tell you that it's not double jeopardy in that it's a civil action versus a criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| So for you lawyers out there, I know we all study double jeopardy in law school, but because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| it's a civil action, it isn't legally double jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| I know the attorneys argue that, but they'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| Shaking money out of their pockets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| So that situation can arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| We certainly are communicating with the state, and they know us, so they know to give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| notice that they're about to send us a certified letter, and they've done so in the past six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| But I can't swear to you that that's not going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Because what we do is when we have our second notice for an underage sale, Cindy under 4-78| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| has to send them a notice letter to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| And so we may or may not know that the ABC is right about to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| We don't always know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| If we have already had them at a hearing, for an administrative hearing, we've complied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| with our city code, and we have to comply with our city code, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| If they then send us that certified letter, they are going to be coming back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| But I think the response to them is, hey, I've already served my time, I've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| been punished for this, is the response is, yes, with regard to your liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| But we're here about your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| And we're here because the state statute requires us to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| And that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| That's how the law is written right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| But if we've already worked on their issue as a city problem, when we get the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| and they come back, at that point, can we say we've already taken care of your issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| Or must we have yet a second hearing to impose a second fine for the same offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| You're not imposing an administrative fine under our city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| What you're going to have to do, and the state statute is very clear, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| to be voting as to whether or not you think an offense occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| And for all the ABC actions we've seen thus far, they've all been agreed orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| And so that means they've already acknowledged the violation occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| So that really isn't a big debate, but you all have to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| You all have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| And that's what you all vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| For example, the next beer board meeting, you'll have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| You'll have to vote as to whether or not you think that action occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| And if that action, you vote that that action occurred the way the state statute reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| you have to refer them to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| I will tell you that City of Knoxville is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Usually, the beer board is acting right at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| They're having the hearing on that situation right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| The board itself is sitting as a hearing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| We haven't drafted our code that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| And so we are, it does take us a little bit longer, but you're going to go to a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| And that's how the statute's written right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Obviously, if the state statute gets changed, and it might happen because this pilot project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| ends in the middle of 2014, that might be a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| But right now, under the state statute, we may have that situation come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| If we wanted to, could we, by ordinance, have the right, if we needed to, to dispose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| it before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| If it's one of these, been there, been here, been there, and you're back again, it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| seems terribly unfair to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| The state statute says the beer board shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| So I mean, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| I'm saying, but on the local ordinance, if we've already done the activity on the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| penalty, could our ordinance be written so that we can say, you're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| In essence, we have reviewed this and feel that the activity that has already taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| is sufficient to punish you or to encourage you to not violate again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| I think we touched on that a little bit, and Allison can correct me if I misheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| I'm just trying to get this fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| The beer board shall schedule a hearing and then go through the steps, but I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| was discussed that the beer board can make a recommendation to the hearing officer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Sort of for time served, so to speak, or penalty paid or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| Say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Well, under the way the statute is currently worded, you'd have to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| You're asking, could you change our local ordinance so that you all would then conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| the hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I guess you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| It's certainly something that other beer boards hold the hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Now, would it be that same day or would it have to be at a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| I'd have to read the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I was wondering if we could have a perfunctory hearing that sort of looked at the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| and said, well, this is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Bless you, my son, sin no more, and get out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| You're asking a little bit of a different question in that because you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| An actual hearing with witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Well, you're going to have to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Now, if they want to present evidence as to whether or not the violation occurred, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| one thing, but they're going to have to ... Your evidence is going to be that ABC packet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| you get, and it's going to have an agreed order in it or it's going to have some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| of evidence in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| At that point, though, when you talk about we've already given them a punishment, time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| served, the statute has another provision where you all ... If you find the violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| occurred under our state statute right now, it requires you to take the same punishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| at minimum as what the state did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Let's say that they had a second violation and they went to a hearing under our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| We held our hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| We got our order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| They've already served 10 days of suspension, and then two months later, lo and behold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| ABC pops up and says, hey, we've taken action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Under the state statute, the way it is right now, if the ABC board took another 10 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| suspension, we would have to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| You're going to get punished more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| As Mr. Bell told us today, the legislature knew that when they were drafting this statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| They understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| I mean, they're mean business under this statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Sounds like you're going to end up in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| I think that possibly there may be some changes coming our way that would solve some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| I think for the next six months during the time of the pilot phase of the statute that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| we're under, we will be maybe facing some of these things again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| The hearing officer has some discretion in how they respond also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| We have one hearing officer now who's been handling these, and she's very consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| and fairly understanding of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Yeah, and I think Allison said that they try to coordinate a little bit closer to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Vice Mayor Pavlis, you were there today, so this is our other ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Yeah, well, I mean, I can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| I think it was 99 or 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| I mean, that's how we did that, Nick, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| And then for whatever reason, it was either 99 or 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| We changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| It used to be, you know, there was some folks at that time thought, well, if we're smart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| enough to give it, we ought to be smart enough to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| And we had full-blown hearings here, and we were the deciding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| And I wouldn't say we should do that for every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| I was thinking in these awkward things whether we could have a somewhat summary hearing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| say, bless you, get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| I don't know how you could write it two-sided, but regardless, I mean, that's how we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| And it seems to work good now as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| And I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but we're the only one in the state that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| it this way, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I'm not aware of any other city that has a veer board that sends it off to a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I think we are unique in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Mr. Frost, do you have some update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| For those of you that subscribed to the New Sentinel, there was actually an article in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| the paper this week about a very unsightly mess over in Oak Ridge with their veer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1037)|
| 0:17:26| which was their elected legislative body, as well with issues about, I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| law being applied evenly and knowing, you know, what they should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| In my personal opinion, the hearing officer has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| You know, it's someone that, you know, is above, you know, the potential political issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| of the situation and tries to apply things fairly and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| And uniformly, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Well, and I will add to that that when we do have full-blown hearings where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| contesting the issues, it is like a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| And we follow the rules of civil procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| And so the hearing officers are all attorneys that practice out in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| And so I can tell you, most of the time, things go very smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| But when they don't go well, it is very nice to have someone who has some experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Knows how to make a record and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I want to ask about the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| We have more than one hearing officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| We have several?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| We have three right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| And how are they selected or appointed or who does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| By our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| But Rob hasn't had the opportunity to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Actually, they serve on one-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| And I have no doubt Charles selected folks that are very able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| So we've just kept on keeping on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Another question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| As you go through this process, some people come before the Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| They have an attorney with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| And some do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| They go through this ABC notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Is there any way that they can have some legal assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Are they on their own for legal assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| There's no legal right to have a free attorney, kind of like what you would have with a criminal trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| I will tell you that Jenna Winfrey at the ABC office in Nashville has dealt with folks who have had attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| and has dealt with folks who haven't had attorneys, just like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Not every person who comes before you and is referred to a hearing has an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| I can tell you that I'm going to tell them the same thing that I would tell their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I'm going to treat them the same way, regardless of whether or not they have an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| It's really important to our law department to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| If I have a violation that's just like another case with a similar violation and they're acting the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| I'm going to really work hard to make sure that the suspension or fine is similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| And I tell everybody that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| I think the ABC does the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| So if somebody calls me and says, should I get an attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| I'm not going to ever tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| I can't give them legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| But I will tell them that folks do come down here with an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| and there are a lot of procedural issues and that sometimes is helpful to have an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| Well, another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| I have the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| I guess it's by each case, but normally on this ABC notice type, what's roughly the time frame on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| As far as when we will get notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Getting all the way down to scheduling the conference occurs and the hearing schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| When you get to the end of it, let me put it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| When we get the certified letter at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| as long as it's more than 14 days, that's when they're going to come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| Once you all send it to a hearing, I have a timeline when I have to file a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| And then under our city code, we have a pretty strict timeline to have the first initial hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| And that's the preliminary hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| At that hearing, the hearing officer, just like a judge would do in a trial, will have a scheduling order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| And she'll talk to us about, is the issue going to be contested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Will there be the need to depose witnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| How long will you take in discovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Depending on how things work, we might have an ultimate hearing set a month from then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| It might be a couple months from then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| So there's not a fixed amount of time once we get into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| It just really depends on the facts of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Is the only violation we deal with is either serving to underage or selling or serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| Is that the only violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| It's not the only violation that I deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| But 4-78 is the only violation, and that's the sales to underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| that come before you on an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| I don't know how many of you all are familiar with the Michaels case that happened years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| That wasn't just underage violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| There were some, but there were also over-serving violations and there was some disorderly conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| In certain situations, in certain cases, if KPD is having a problem with an establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| and it's not an underage sale issue, there are times when we will file a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| and we have the authority to do so under the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| And it's the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| It just doesn't come to the beer board for an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| The only administrative hearings we have are under 4-78, and that deals with underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Any other questions on this section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Okay, the TABC, City of Knoxville Beer Board Compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| I think we kind of lumped all these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Do you want to add anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| I hope that it's been helpful to you, and feel free to call if you ever have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| about why a particular case is working one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| We really do try to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| But I can understand, especially this summer when we were first starting to see these cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| why there was some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Of course, there's always one way that we won't have any of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| and that's if everyone is in compliance when they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| And sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Thank you very much, and thank you for going this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Sergeant Hunter, you're involved with the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Do you have anything to add, or are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| I think you all covered it fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| I will say that ABC was very complimentary of Sergeant Hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| and the working relationship between the two bodies in enforcing particularly underage drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| and overselling and some other kinds of issues that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| The next item on the agenda is one that we have dealt with at the beer board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| and that is when to approve pending final documentation and when to defer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| And I did send all of you kind of a worksheet to give this some serious thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| What I tried to do was identify the most common situations when we have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| And so the first one is, have they paid the publication fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| Is everybody fine with, you know, approved pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| Typically, let's say you won't send this to us if they haven't paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Yes, ma'am, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| So that's kind of a moot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Mr. Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Maybe you folks can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Let's say I want to get a beer license, and so I come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| How much education do you give me in terms of going through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| and knowing that, you know, that I have to do this, this, this, and this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and I have to see the building officials and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| so that I know whether or not I want to even apply at that particular time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| In other words, I might be building an establishment that I don't plan to open until July 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| so would I come to you and you would tell me a process I'd go through and say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| well, you may not want to get your license until June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| In other words, how do we prep an applicant before they end up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| where we have to say pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Well, it kind of just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| If they're smaller businesses and they kind of know they're going to go in immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| If we have a former owner sitting there, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| sometimes the sale of the business is contingent upon this new owner being able to obtain a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| So that can kind of slow down things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| They'll get the beer permit maybe a couple of months in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| But generally we go over it with them piece by piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| We do tell them that they do have to call the inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| get the inspectors out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Of course, we give them that second page of the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| If you copy it off of the website, it's the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| All the little check marks have to be checked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Has everybody's phone number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Go over that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| But we have very few that, you know, get scared with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| They're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Well, in your experience, having done this for so long, are there extenuating circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| Are there certain circumstances that continue to crop up that we may say, well, yeah, those ought to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Oh, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| You mean like records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Like what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| You mean like records checks or things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| I mean, is there something that keeps coming up that you've seen over the period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| The main problem is calling the inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| They forget to do that because, like the fire department and the building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| they come out and okay the building, but not for the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| And I really myself don't know what the difference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| But they have to call, make an appointment with the inspectors, and that's been our biggest problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| We try to get them to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| We give it to them when they come in to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| If they mail the application in, we send that page to them that tells them they have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| Then a few days before or a week before the beer board meeting, I send them a reminder letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| And if I don't have those checked off in their file, I check them off again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| You need to call your inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| But that, I think, is the number one thing, inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| If I could interject on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| I've seen a few come through that the lease or the sales contract is contingent upon getting a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| And that would, you know, if they get that early enough, then they've got to do their tenant improvements or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| Then that could delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| And it could delay it for six months if you had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| We've seen a couple of those that I know of personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Well, let's go on down the list a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| The Knox County, the current city business license and the Knox County business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| they have those for the time they get to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Yes, ma'am, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Here's where we get to the inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| The certificate of zoning, that one is always in place because it is either zoned for what they want to do or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| And if they want to appeal and get a different zoning, then they need to go to a different body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| The building inspector approval, again, it's a matter of them calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| And right now, the building department is not so overwhelmed with construction permits citywide that they can't get to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| But if you call them on Monday before your hearing on Tuesday, there's a really good chance they won't be there to take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1686)|
| 0:28:14| The same for the fire prevention and the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| I think the rub with this body has been on the task program certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Sergeant Hunter, do you want to review for us one more time when the classes are offered and what the process is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| The classes are offered every Thursday except for Thanksgiving and Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| The classes are mandated by the state to run five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| They run nine to three when they call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| We have an actual dedicated phone line that they can call and get an automated message that tells them everything that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| would tell them over the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| But they frequently call our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| We tell them you have to show up to class about 30 minutes early because we only have space for 30 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| So it's first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| And some days we do have to send people home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| They have to bring a government-issued photo ID to sit for the class because we check everybody's identity before they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| through it, $50 cash check or money order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| And then we go over the registration process with them when we bring them downstairs to the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| That's pretty much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| When is the records check initiated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| When we're doing the task class, we'll go over the sign-in sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| We'll look at the sign-in sheet, and after they've filled out their registration paperwork, we'll ask them how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| in the class need to undergo a background check and get fingerprinted because they're either a new manager that's been added on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| or they've newly applied for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| And then what we'll do is we'll check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| We'll find out the names of the people who raised their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| We'll check to see that they are in the system, and if they aren't, then we tell them they have to file the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| and pay the fee to WANDA before we can do the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| If they have already done that and they're good to go, then we do that for the people in the class that same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| How frequently do you have more than 30 people show up for a class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Usually we'll have a full class right after the two weeks after Mary sends out the letters that people are not in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1812)|
| 0:30:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| And she does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| She keeps up with that monthly, so I think the letters go out probably every other month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Mike, this is the one that —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Where do you actually conduct the classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Where are they held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| They're held at the safety building in the training room in the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| This is the one that has caused the most controversy and sometimes is an uncomfortable situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| when one person will come through and they don't have the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| and then the next person comes through and they do have the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| So in the interest of some consistency, we need to see if we can come to some kind of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| We may not all be comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| We may all love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| I don't know, but we need to be giving some serious thought to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| Mr. Frost, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| I was just going to say, if you're going to have a policy, it needs to be applied equally to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| I mean, you know, you might, for example, you know, the Capitol Grill is coming to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| and they have some things that you haven't, they haven't checked the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| and you pass them subject to final documentation, and then the next folks up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| it's George and Stephanie's Rock and Bowl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| and they haven't done many of the similar same things, yet they get deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| If not outright turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| But from a legal perspective, from just, I guess, a fundamental fairness perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| treat, you've got to treat folks the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1915)|
| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Well, I'm in favor of, that's the minimum, that they have to have attended the class and have the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| And then that takes away any type of subjective answer authority that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| I mean, what you, we can, it's out of our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| We've seen the background check, we've seen the records check, and there's no, I mean, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| And the rest of the stuff is just a matter of whether they get the forms filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| So your suggestion is that if they have not completed the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| or they don't have the records check, that we would defer it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Councilman de la Vogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| We're not taking motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| We're just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| I was just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| And then we're going to remember at the next meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| I mean, looking at this checklist that you have, the first four items are, it seems to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| they're preconditioned before they ever get on the agenda, I would guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| I don't, I think they should have them, they're in their control to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| I don't know why they wouldn't have done those first four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| On the three or four inspections, if they've requested it and it hasn't yet happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| it's somewhat out of their control, and I feel like, you know, we could give them some leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| Let me get to George's point, the two main things that might bar them, or do they have the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| and do they have the record background that allows them to serve liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| I mean, that's pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| So it sounds like if you're going to be consistent, you ought to be deferring rather than winking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| or pending something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| We ought to just say, sorry, you didn't do it, come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Get to class and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| It's not our problem, it's yours, kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Because you may find out things on their record that you may, we may decide as a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| as a board to say that's fine or it's not fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| But that's really not up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| If their record is not in compliance, they would not, whether we acted or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| they would not get the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Ms. Day is very good about not letting a license go out without everything dotted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| eyed and crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| But those are the real substantive things George is saying, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Things that match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| That is something we talk about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| We go back and say, well, wait a minute, what's their record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| You know, we discuss that and we've, I think we've delayed or deferred or sent some people out based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| on their record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| So it is a little bit, I see it as a little bit subjective when you're talking about those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| The awkward one to me is when we have two owners and one did the task class and the other was out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| and he's going to do it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I don't know what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| We haven't been real consistent about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Well, I guess I'll start with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Is there any, do we have any discretion on the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| Aren't there some crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| I guess, because my opinion is that, and frustration sort of just sitting on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| is that we really don't, with these, with giving out these permits, we really don't have any discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| Actually, there's some places where I think a committee, not the locally elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2100)|
| 0:35:08| sitting as the beer board grant the beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| I think, or that might be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I think it might be allowed under the state law, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| But generally speaking, you have the crimes of moral turpitude as a basis for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| Now, a lot of the times people get crossways because they have failed to disclose something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| They're not being truthful on their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| And that's how they can get denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| Or in some circumstances, you know, we've had some managers lately who failed to disclose a litany of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2139)|
| 0:35:47| And they've gotten deferred for 30 days where they can find a manager that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| Is your answer to the question that we do have some discretion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| The state legislature and I guess the alcohol lobby has taken away a lot of the discretion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| Because my feeling is that since we don't really have any discretion, I just see at some point there's going to be some story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| by some applicant that we're going to want to approve it pending final documentation and break this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| If we do adopt this thing, well, why don't we just approve them all pending that final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| And, you know, they've still got to check the boxes to get the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| You know, I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| You know, for all we know, they could sleep through the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| But we still approve it, whether they do it before or after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I mean, so to me, in terms of wanting to be, you know, business friendly and sort of get through this red tape to get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2199)|
| 0:36:49| I think I'm in favor of approving them all pending final documentation because we really don't have any discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| You know, we sit up here and we have microphones and turn on lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| But at the end of the day, we have to approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| And if they don't check the box, you know, if they don't check the boxes, they don't get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| I'll get to you in just a second, Vice Mayor Pamela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I agree with Councilman Starr on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| I mean, we really don't have the discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| I mean, Rob was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| I think your answer was, you know, the moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| I mean, we don't have discretion in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Either they are or they aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Our actual city ordinance says, basically, if you check all the boxes, you shall get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| So, I mean, I guess, you know, my question would be to Wanda is, have we ever, in your knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| you've been doing this how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Given a permit out inadvertently without all the boxes being checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2268)|
| 0:37:57| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| And, I mean, I think that would be the consistent answer all the way across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| And you're trying to get people who are opening businesses that are, like you say, one manager has been in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| one hasn't been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Being in the restaurant business as long as I was and seeing the actual stages right before the restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| and what have you are open are chaotic and very chaotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| You know, not always, but for the most part they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| And I just, you know, I don't think it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| I don't know really what the purpose is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| I understand, oh, you're not being, you're not doing your diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| and you're going to sell to young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| I don't see that correlation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| And I think that we should be, as Councilman Starr said, you know, as business friendly as we can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| and keep the process moving along and let them get open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| You know, they're hiring people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| They're bringing in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| They're paying property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| So, you know, unless it became a problem, I would be in favor, as I always have been, of going ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| The bottom line is that that permit is not going out the door until they have completed the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| So if they go to the next one after the beer board meeting, then they will have satisfied the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| but they won't have to wait four weeks or in some cases five weeks to get their permit to be operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| The same thing for the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| If the record comes back and shows that there are some things that are out of line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| then they won't get the license either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| When I see Mr. Swanson's in the back of the room and when he was the predecessor to Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| I think five of us were beaten so severely so often about the limits of the power of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| And I remember one discussion that someone came and they had a pretty hefty property tax bill that they owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| And there were some people on the beer board who wanted to hold that license until they paid those property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| I've seen some people come with some speeding tickets that dated back several years, several thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| And I just really want to say, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| If you can't be responsible to do that, how could you be responsible for the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| But then Mr. Swanson's standing back behind me, beating me, saying, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| So those of you who are newer to the beer board missed that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| But he did take fairly well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Well, dog dare him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Pay the bill and he'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I'm going to go to Councilman Greave, then to Mayor Brown, and then to Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| I think maybe, Ms. Palmer, maybe you deserved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| Oh, I shouldn't have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| I just got the Palmer look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| You know, I understand what both of you are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| And I kind of have mixed feelings about it because I do wonder what kind of power we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| But on the other hand, I think that, you know, I sort of equate it like getting a driver's license or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| You know, you have to be prepared and you have to go and you have to take the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| And, you know, if you go and get your driver's license and don't pass the test, you don't get your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| And I think that, to me, if somebody is going to open a business, and we do want to be business friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| but if somebody wants to open a business, they need to have a checklist of things they need to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| And if this is important to them, which it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| it also, I think it sends a message for what we think is important as a board and as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| And I think that we want to continue to send that message that, hey, you know, we're serious about your beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| And that I think that if this is one way in which we can do that, I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| But, you know, it is, I mean, it's kind of complicated, but I think that we should come to some kind of consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| that we're either going to accept it or we're not going to accept it so that we don't get into this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| where Dwayne Greve gets a beer license and George Wallace doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| So if we can come to some kind of consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| But I think it's pretty serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| I mean, when I think about, you know, trying to open a business and, Nick, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| I mean, you know, we've worked with restaurants and we know what goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| But it also says to me, well, what's important here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| You know, in terms of if you want that license and you know and we're clear in terms of what's expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| then I think it should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| And I'm really sorry to interrupt because this clearly is a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| But lawyers are, we usually have to look at worst case scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| And I want to bring up a situation that has come up in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| When the records check is done, you obviously have seen those before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| And so they'll have a list of crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| And while you all don't have a lot of discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| sometimes the issue about moral turpitude is a little bit fuzzy and gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| For example, if somebody is charged with an exhibitionist-type crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| where they're running across Nalin Field naked, that's clearly a criminal offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| But it's not so clear if that's moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| And so I want you all to understand, like, you all are the ones that make the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| of whether or not it's a crime of moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| If you don't see that records check before you grant the permit, WANDA can't make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| And so that concerns me just a little bit about not getting the records check before you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| And I understand the point about being business friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| but the records check doesn't take very long to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| And it's something totally within their control to apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| So they're not waiting on anybody at the city to apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| So please keep that in mind, because if WANDA then gets the records check back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| and there's a questionable charge, and we've had that come up before it comes to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| about is this something of crime of moral turpitude or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| we don't make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| You all have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Yes, I agree that we need to be consistent so we be fair to everyone that comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| But, Mr. Frost, I think you said that there are some municipalities where there's a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| other than the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I thought about that more, but I think it is allowed under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| I think I've researched that issue before, where you can appoint someone to make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| and grant the beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| I'm just curious how long, you may know, you may not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| has the city council served as the beer board here in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| As long as I can ever remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| So about five years in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| But, Nick, you were really close on the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| It was 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| I'll have to research that and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Something real quick also about moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| I've got something here that I've spoken about with Allison and Ron Mills and the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| because on occasion we'll have something come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| This is six pages of different crimes that are about moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| If you recall, we had someone falsely claim their girlfriend was getting raped in a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| on Cumberland Avenue because the guy was mad and gotten thrown out, and obviously that was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| So it's different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| It's fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| It's evil intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| So, you know, you get these, you know, Tracy Ryan's records check, and you'll see these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| A little investigation needs to be done on some of these crimes that have been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| Most often I've observed over the time I've been on the beer board that people will check that they have no record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| but then as the record comes back, perhaps they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| And so this has been probably where we've denied most licenses is because they did not carefully read the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2766)|
| 0:46:16| and answer the questions carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| You made all my points right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I mean, I think Allison said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| It's not every time, but we had a situation over here where, I won't name names, but we had a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| It came across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Yeah, it came across the street, and we had the owner, and we said as a group, there's no way we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| We didn't agree with the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| We didn't, there was other factors that we considered outside, and we denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| Criminal, the wife opens the second place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Yeah, and so I think to take, you know, it's, I'll just go back to Duane and what Allison said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| and what you just said, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I think that's one thing you got to look at, and we got a little bit of judgment on, and it's not total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| I would give up on the task class before I gave up on the background check, but it's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| it's okay to have guidelines and application and follow process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| That does not mean you're un-business friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| That's just the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Do the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| If you're serious about it, getting a beer permit and opening up your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| these are things you got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| It's not that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| One of the things that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| I don't want to be unreasonable, but I don't want to be unfair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| but I think you definitely want to apply it in a consistent manner, and I think we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| One of the things that we could do, and when they come to get the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| and with the paperwork that goes with it, is to really stress and emphasize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| you better have that records checked before your date, your first date comes up for city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| and then if they choose to not do that, that's their issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| But, I mean, that would be one way to really stress everything on here needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| but there are some things that need to be done sooner than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| and that records check is one of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| Get the task class out of the way, and then, you know, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| if you get the application and you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| and where those items come on the checklist are not as high as they are, as they might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| and maybe it's just a matter of reordering those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Councilman DellaVote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Well, I've heard two viewpoints now, and I'm still wrestling with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| but I think I know where I come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| One is that it's a drive-through window, and if you check all the boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| you get the permit and off you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| And the other is, well, in addition to having formal steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| there is this, I don't know, sense that's instilled on them that it's an important obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| and even though it may be somewhat rote in terms of checking the blocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| that it's going to be taken serious, and you better mind the store when you leave with the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| And so, and I think that second view is probably worth sticking with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| I think that they ought to know that we're serious about the sales to minors and those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| and that they have to have procedures in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| and maybe we should even remind them as we give them the permit or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| because that's the one deterrent is just that they just don't casually put in a bunch of baloney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| on a form and get a permit and go off and do the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Councilman Grieben and Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Well, I was going to say, Nick had said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| if you look down the list, there are two things that are absolutely the responsibility of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| and that's the task program and the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| And the corporate charter has gotten, I'm not even sure how that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| The applicant provides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| So there, really, when you look down the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| there's two or three things that are really the responsibility of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| and it seems to me that they ought to do that on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| I think that I've heard a compromise here in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| we might be willing to accept the task not being completed at the time that they're before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| but the records check, background check, you know, based on what Allison said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| I mean, I heard two different deals, but she's, you know, she's in the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| and we're on record, and I don't want to go against what she said because we could have problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| But, I mean, I think that would be probably a pretty good compromise if we're looking for a compromise here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| to accept it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| If they don't have the background check, it's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| And if they have everything but the task or, you know, some of the, then it would be a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| We could do a straw poll and really drive Marshall crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I think a straw poll is just a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Do you want to word that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Well, you know, I thought I just did, but let me think about it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Mr. Frost, you might want to help me, but let me take a stab at it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| I mean, I think it's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| The boxes that need to be checked off, the one that we would not collectively approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| is if the background check was not before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| And then I heard that, or, you know, I think that there could probably be some wiggle room there on the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| And those are the things, really, that we can affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| How's the comfort level on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Everybody comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| It's not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Well, with the understanding that if you don't come in with a certificate from the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| when you get to the office, they don't hand you the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| You've got to turn in something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Well, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| But the records check is where they, you know, that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| So everybody's comfort level is good, then if they have not done the records check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| we would defer until the next meeting so that they could get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| Are we good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| And in the task class, Wanda will do a body block to prevent them leaving the office with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| So we're good on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| I have just a slight question to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| Should we be advising them from this panel that, hey, you've got a manager with a blacklist in terms of conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3145)|
| 0:52:34| activity, whatever, go get a different manager and resubmit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| I mean, maybe that's business friendly, but I don't know whether we should be advising them or just denying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Well, we tell them that that manager's not eligible, and so if we are business friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| we would give them 30 days to find a new manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| And someone that we recently made that suggestion has done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| So in most of the cases that have come before us, they have taken care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| What surprised me in that instance, and I think several others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| is that the business had not done a background check on somebody who would be an integral part of their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| and particularly since this was a national chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| So, you know, that has become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Can we move on to the last item on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| No, we just all were comfortable, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Everybody nodded and smiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| I took that as a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Stained, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Where's John King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Remember, he still has 15 minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| The last item on the agenda, and then we'll have public forum, is the revised special event application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| And I think that you each have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| It should be probably the very last two pages of the stack of stuff that Ms. Wilson so graciously prepared for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| And what this is removes a lot of items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| because special event beer permit applications do not have to go through all the hoops that others have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| But in this particular case, this makes it very clear that they have to have a copy of the designation letter from the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| that they are, in fact, a 501C3 and or that they are a political organization defined in Tennessee code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3256)|
| 0:54:27| What is a political organization defined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| It could be a PAC, it could be a candidate, or it could be a political party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| But they would have to have that definition, and they would have a letter that tells them that they meet that qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| Just a reminder that no one can have two permits, one for their business normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3283)|
| 0:54:52| and then a special event permit at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| You can only have one permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| And what this particular application does in the revised form is to make it pretty clear that you have to be one of these two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3298)|
| 0:55:07| or you're not going to get a special event permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| And what my proposal is that if everybody is okay with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| that we will send these out with all of the applicants from the past two years for special event permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| so that they see that the application has changed and that they also have a list of the beer board meeting dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3322)|
| 0:55:30| with the understanding that they need to have their stuff in by the first of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| that we're not going to have a special meeting because they forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| And that they know that there have been some changes, that we are friendly, we want to be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| Most of them have done a really good job, but this kind of eases some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| The first part of the first page is right out of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| And so it's not something that I dreamed up late one night when I couldn't sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| You're talking about the A through E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| What about the situation we had where the person wanted to do something in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| but they were not allowed to, they had to stay physically on the grounds of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| They had issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| What they were seeking was outside the CBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| Allison, do you recall the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| I think most of the time it's the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| If it's not within the CBID, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| And I think that was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| The other one, I don't think they actually had a special event permit at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| They had a beer permit for their establishment, and they had gone to special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| but they didn't have a special event permit from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| And that was the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| There's a difference between a special event beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| and a special event permit from the special events office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| And we will be coordinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| I'll be working to coordinate with them more closely so that we don't have a he said, she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| Well, they said in special events I could close the street and sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| and then special events didn't say that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| So this will eliminate some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| But we will be working very closely with special events office to see that we don't get into that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| They came up with the idea that you can only do this twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| That was in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| It's been in the code forever, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| People that get a permit for the whole year and they have like five different events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Chilhowee Park and the zoo is in Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| And so they can do more than two special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| And I think the zoo is going to apply for a regular beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| That is a different part of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| But this is groups like, well, we'll take the Rossini Festival, the opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| They could get two special event beer permits over the course of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| And most organizations, if they're going to do more than two special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| they'll just go ahead and get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| We had the arts group down on the 100 block of Gay Street did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| They just got tired of dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| IMES came in and got a beer permit because they wanted to do more than two events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| But this is for people like the Dogwood Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| Help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Second Harvest, right, so that they really only want to deal with beer twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| And so this basically kind of sets things out very clearly for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| so that they know what they have to do and what they don't have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| And it's only for selling the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| In other words, if I want to have a block party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| I don't have to have a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| No, you can't have a block party because you can't close your street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| Well, I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| You could, and then Sergeant Hunter might come calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| Special detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| I mean, I'm sure that there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| But legally, streets cannot be closed and beer can't be consumed on the street other than some special zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| Am I right, Ms. Evertine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Well, there was that one issue that got brought to your attention, Rob, about I think it was in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3551)|
| 0:59:19| They wanted to have Park Ridge, I think, wanted to have an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| And as long as they stayed on their property of one residence or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| and didn't take it off the property, it was okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| And they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| I don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| I would guess that people, knowing people in Park Ridge, that probably got together and they served free beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| As far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| They would not need a permit for that, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| We're not out there policing what you do if you're having a party at your house and the party's outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| But when you start talking about closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| But when you start consuming beer out in the street, that's technically a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| So, Mr. Greave, I would like to not know that you're having a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| I'll be sure to invite you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| And just remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| It's going to be Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| I'm not able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| People who walk out in the street on Cumberland with a cup of beer do get cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| And so, that's no different than walking on Kingston Pike with a bottle of beer or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3617)|
| 1:00:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| So, is everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Well, then let's have your separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| I just wanted to bring this up at this time since we're talking about the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| And it's about the termination issue when someone comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| And I think there's some members that feel frustrated when an employer comes up here that's terminated the employee that's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3644)|
| 1:00:54| And sometimes it's almost like they want to punish the employer who's terminated the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| And I understand that because a lot of times it seems like they feel like if they just terminate the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| that that's going to satisfy us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| But being an employment lawyer, I mean, it's, I mean, the most conservative advice you'd give to an employer that had an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3668)|
| 1:01:18| would be to terminate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| So, you could be giving them advice that really contradicts what their attorney might tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| Because, I mean, if you think about it, I mean, they run a business and their employee broke the law while they were working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| So, and it's a serious law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| And they put their business at risk, serious liability, hundreds, millions of dollars at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3698)|
| 1:01:46| To terminate that employee is a pretty logical step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| And if you think about it, you know, if you think about other things that are taken serious in the workplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| sexual harassment or violence, you know, if you take it seriously, you would terminate that employee that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3717)|
| 1:02:05| committed sexual harassment in a serious way or committed violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| You wouldn't say, oh, it's time to go have training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| And then, also, you have to think about just the liability moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Because then, if you keep that employee, you now know that they have sold to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| So, if they do it again, there's a history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| And then, that increases your potential liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| And I don't know if the other lawyers in the room want to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| But it's just something, you know, I think, of course, everybody on the board is entitled to their own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| And it's certainly our liberty to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| But just sitting in my chair when I hear that, I kind of seize up and think, no, this could be an employer that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| doing everything he can to protect his or her business and taking this as serious as possible and wants to make an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| I mean, it's, how do you, as an employer, how do you say this is the most serious offense you can is to terminate them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3777)|
| 1:03:07| And so, the other employees know, you know, if I care about this job, I better not serve underage or I'm going to get terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| I mean, to me, that's, there's a real deterrent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| So, I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| I've never felt comfortable saying it while in the midst of a discussion because I didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| because I understood where people are coming from when they bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| But I just wanted to bring that up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| And I think this is an advantage to having an attorney with a specialty as yours on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| Now, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Yeah, well, you know, you're wiring up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| But, you know, it's just, here's the thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| The reality of it is, is that person can walk probably 50 feet and get the same job as a server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| or a waitress or waiter or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| I mean, again, being in the restaurant business as long as I was, I mean, that's what happens to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| And so, they take that same record and the same bad record and then they can go right down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| and do the same thing again as opposed to they know if that employer knows the record, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| but train them, work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| I mean, I'm not, you know, I say it more than anybody and probably the only one that's ever said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| But work with them and train them to not do that and teach them not to do it rather than fire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| And then they just keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| I'm just telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| I mean, you see the same people, you know, that make a living doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3874)|
| 1:04:41| They can get a job practically every day because, you know, there's high turnover in the restaurant business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| So, you know, number one, I'm not giving them advice and I feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| I mean, they can take it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| But I like the fact that they say that they work with them and they train them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| and then hopefully that eliminates that bad act, as you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| And I'm just concerned about in terms of us punishing them for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| I mean, it's, you know, that was just my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| There won't be any punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| There's nothing that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Well, we can send them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Because usually it's a discussion about if we're going to send them to a hearing or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| So, you know, I felt a little uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| We'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| We'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| I still say it, but we'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Ms. Wilson, do we have anyone signed up for public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| No further business being before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| Let's all move to our next event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop131121?start=3938)|
