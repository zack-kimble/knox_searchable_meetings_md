| 0:01:36| Seven present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| All right, we'll start off with some introductory remarks with Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| I know that sidewalks and greenways and bike paths are always a very popular topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| and I think you've probably spoken with every councilmember here about them many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| But we're excited to hear this presentation with you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| and I'll turn it over to you and want to make sure we welcome you and your staff for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| The good news tonight is you won't have to hear much from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| We've got some good folks that have a lot of good information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| As a preamble, we're going to be looking at three studies tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| Number one is the bike study that was completed in 2015, a summary of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| a summary of the greenway study done in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| and what has been a draft that has now been adopted by our department, the sidewalk study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| which is the most current one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| And that's appropriate because the definition of connectivity today is those three things put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=159)|
| 0:02:48| And so we'll be sharing with you updated numbers of those studies so that you have 2022 real values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=168)|
| 0:02:59| at least we hope real values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| This economy kind of makes it a little iffy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| If I may, I want to back up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| And if you'll forgive this analogy, it does have some pertinence to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| And that has to do with my oldest daughter's first car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| And the first car she wanted was a 1987 Toyota FJ60 Land Cruiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| And this was 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| And most wanted something souped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| She wanted the Land Cruiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| And if you remember that vintage, and maybe I'm the only one that's old enough to remember that vintage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| But thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| That was the epitome of dependable SUVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| And if you could get the thing up to 60 miles an hour, 65 miles an hour on the interstate, you were lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| And if you remember how we drove when we literally had to drive them, you don't do like we do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| and that is you just kind of touch the steering wheel with your two fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| You literally were working it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| The steering mechanisms were not what they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| The suspensions were not what they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| That was reflected in our roadway design back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| For subdivisions, a lot of the subdivisions that we have today are of that vintage or before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| 26 feet of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| 26 feet was established to give people a place to walk, believe it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| a place for parking if you had family over or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| And because of the technology of the vehicles in those days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| you really didn't have the suspension, if you will, to go that fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| And so it was safe to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| It's changed a lot in these few years, and I do consider them few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| But also we have to go back and look at the definition of connectivity in those days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| and that is moving volumes of traffic, having sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| Bikes weren't even a consideration back then, at least here in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| But it was also in that vintage that things began to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| Bike helmets became a requirement in many states that same year, 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| ADA was adopted in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| All of a sudden, we started seeing the definition of connectivity changing, and appropriately so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| to where if I mention connectivity to you all tonight, you are not thinking vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| That's roadways. That's over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| That has to do with providing infrastructure that allow people to walk safely and bike safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| and do it in a manner that if they do have impairments that require wheelchairs or others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| that we have designed and built that infrastructure in a way that accommodates them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=353)|
| 0:06:03| That's what tonight is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| If you have looked at the sidewalk study as well as the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| you're going to see a list of priorities for each council district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| I want to kind of set the stage for what you're seeing, what it is, and truly what it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| From a scoring system that our consultants set up and that we agreed to within our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| we did set priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| Those priorities do not reflect the first project that we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| Project number one that may be the number one priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| we're not going to wait until we have money to do that one and then go to number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| The way we choose our sidewalk projects, candidly, is based on available funding and opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| And the best example I can give you is the grant application you all approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| within the past year for us to go after a grant for the Naland Drive sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| That wasn't necessarily on the radar screen or very high on the radar screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| but the opportunity was there to get significant grant dollars for limited city funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=430)|
| 0:07:21| As we go into this, I want to make sure that that is understood and not misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| You may have some things in your district that you see that go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| whoa, these really need to be swapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| And we're very open to that, very, very open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| But please don't construe this as if all of a sudden we're going to start hitting number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| We chip away at this as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| It's also important to note you all adopted the Mayor's Climate Council goals and Vision Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| Everything we do incorporates those in the decisions we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| Everything we do decision-wise and construction-wise incorporates multimodal accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=486)|
| 0:08:16| and creating it in such a way that it is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| So much so that we have gone back and revised plans, case in point, Woodland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| to make sure that the cyclists would be safe from the type of vehicles that we use that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| and not get whacked by the mirror from a commercial vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| The third part of this is that you're going to see some numbers that will be mind-blowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| I don't know any other way to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| And that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| We have to have a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| What we also must be cognizant of, and we're seeing this in some of our other infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| is that as we begin to expand our sidewalks, our bike facilities, our greenway facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| we're already seeing the need for maintenance for projects that have been done in the recent past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| We cannot forget the maintenance component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| This has been a collaborative effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| This has not just been an engineering department effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| And Brian Blackman's here with sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| He's been a remarkable partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Parks and Rec, remarkable partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| We can't do this alone, nor should we do this alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| So that's why you're going to hear some different voices tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| I will ask you to write down one number, and at the end of this I'll unpack it very, very briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| to try to keep things in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| But somewhere on your paper, if you would write the number 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| then we'll open up that present towards the end of tonight, if that's all right, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| With that, I'm going to turn it over to Tom Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| I believe he's going to speak to our bike plan and the updated numbers for it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| Thank you very much, Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Mr. Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Tom Clabo, Deputy Engineering Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| I'm going to briefly go over an update of the bicycle facilities plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| That plan was approved in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| The purpose of the plan was to provide safe, convenient, desirable mode of transportation for bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| The plan was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| We hired a couple of consultants, Tool Design and Kimley Horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| and it was a collaborative effort between the City of Knoxville Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| and Knoxville Regional Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| The plan included a steering committee which looked at the overall bicycle network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| and worked towards getting the existing network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=657)|
| 0:11:05| and then that was shared in a couple of public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| The plan ended up resulting in over 220 projects, and it was for a 10-year planning window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=670)|
| 0:11:19| In today's dollars, the result of those projects was over $133 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| Is that a million or a billion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| A million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| The initial network, the first thing they did was lay out the baseline for what was existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| So the plan identified six miles of bike lanes and 0.25 miles of shared lane markings or sharrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=697)|
| 0:11:48| Since that time, we have increased that number to 21.2 miles of bike lanes and 12.6 miles of sharrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=708)|
| 0:11:58| We've made some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| As far as 2022 status, of the over 220 projects that were identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| we've implemented or have at least initiated 43 of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| which is 20 percent of what was identified in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| The plan broke out projects, prioritized those by kind of time frames from 0 to 5 years, 5 to 10, or 10-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=737)|
| 0:12:27| and those windows were really identified based on the difficulty and cost of the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| So they were looking for kind of quick wins as far as project implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| They were also looking for what made sense as far as connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| and so they wanted to grow the existing network by implementing these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| So with that in mind, one of the concepts that we utilize are called quick build bicycle projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=770)|
| 0:12:58| So these are roadways where there's existing asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| and there's opportunities to maybe narrow lanes due to the volume of traffic that's on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=783)|
| 0:13:11| so those are road diets, or there's places where maybe there's solid street parking that's not fully utilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| and there's a reallocation of that space to bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| And so those are the type of kind of what we call quick build projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| that don't have a huge impact on existing adjacent property or huge construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=808)|
| 0:13:37| Another idea there that enhanced existing bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| so we want to look at in some cases either adding a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| or some sort of vertical barrier to help separate bikes to make it a more comfortable place to ride a bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=829)|
| 0:13:58| or these green pavement conflict markers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| This is an example of one of these quick build projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| This is Hill Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| You all are probably very familiar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| It's looking eastbound on Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Those bike lanes were originally put in probably the mid-2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| We had issues with folks actually speeding on the Viaduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| and so we looked at an opportunity to go in and narrow the lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| introduce this buffer to give a little bit more separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| to make it a little more comfortable experience for bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| You'll also see the green conflict marker there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| and there's a flexible delineator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| You can see it kind of at the top of the screen there in the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| And then we also added radar signage as far as the speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| to try to notify drivers if they're going in excessive speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| So this is a real good example of this idea of a quick build project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| As far as bike lanes that have been completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| this is a list of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| It's not all-inclusive, but it does give a good example of some of the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| where we have identified and been able to install bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| One thing that's interesting about this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| it applies a lot of those concepts we just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| We were able to utilize, as Harold said, we look for opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| and I think that's going to be a common theme you hear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| These typically aren't just funded capital bike plan projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| We develop these projects through any opportunity that we have a chance to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| Some of them we coordinate closely with our resurfacing program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| and so we're looking at streets that maybe have excess capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| looking for road dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| We can restripe and introduce these bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| or a roadway might have shoulders that we can convert to bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| through the resurfacing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Some of these projects, like Broadway is an example of a road dot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| where we introduced bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| University Avenue had on-street parking that we converted to bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| In some cases, like Burrell, I think it had shoulders that ended up being converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| In all those cases, we look for existing projects, funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| where we can find a way to implement these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| One of the examples up there was Liberty Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| This was a very good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| If you're familiar with Liberty Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| it provided a bike connection from Middlebrook Park over to Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| at the Third Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| And so we were able, through the resurfacing program, to do a road dot here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| reduce that roadway from four lanes to three, and introduce buffered bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| Another interesting thing about this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| not only were we using the resurfacing program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| but we've also applied for and were successful in getting a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| And so we're extending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| This project's not complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| We've still got a portion from Division Street to Sutherland to put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| which includes a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| And so we're looking at all modes of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| And then we had one more project here, East Hill Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| And this particular project, it was a result of some paving we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| We had some extra lane width that we could convert into a dedicated bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| It's kind of hard to see, but you can see at the very top of the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| there's a shared lane marker there as well, shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| And that's coming downhill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| and so it felt like it was appropriate for bikes to be in the traffic lane there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1065)|
| 0:17:54| As far as share-o's or shared lane markings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| these are some example projects of where we've been able to implement that type of installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| These are important as far as a critical part of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| It's restricted right away with the cost of installing bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1088)|
| 0:18:16| It's very difficult to go into every street and have bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| And so this is an opportunity for streets that are less than 35 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| to apply pavement markings that notify vehicles that bikes are utilizing this facility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1105)|
| 0:18:34| And one of the examples of that is Nadine Street, which runs parallel with North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| It's a critical connection north-south in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| and we're able to provide space for bikes within the existing travel lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1123)|
| 0:18:51| The next type of project are these capital construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| They're larger projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| They require multiple years to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| They typically have right-of-way acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| They're in excess of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| These are the bigger type projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| The cover of the plan sheet there you see is the Kingston Pike Multimodal Project that we're working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| That's a connection along Kingston Pike from Papermill Drive to Wesley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| and that's an example of one of these larger projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| In this last slide, I just wanted to point out, go back to this idea of opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| When we're looking at active transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| we're not always going to have dedicated funding for each of these types of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| and so we have adopted a complete street policy back in, I think, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| With every project that we implement, we look at all these plans you're going to hear tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| to see where the existing facilities are, where we can make connections, where we can make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| It's much more effective to implement these types of projects when you're rebuilding a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| and I think Tim's going to speak to one of these in Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| where we have some opportunities for some greenways there and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| But the other thing I will point out, there's 19 projects listed on this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| and the total estimated cost is $96 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| These projects are not cheap, but they are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| Next, we've got Tim Hester. He's going to talk about greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| On that last slide, is that just a sampling of projects or is that the total number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| No, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| Let me just give you a couple of examples here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Like we showed, the 2023 resurfacing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| What does that have to do with active transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Well, as we talked about, we're able to look for opportunities for road diets to introduce these type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| This is a sampling of projects where we have some application of active transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| whether we're introducing back lanes, shared lane markings, sidewalks, greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| This is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| It's not all-inclusive of projects that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Mr. Clabo, before we move on to the next presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| this is the time that's designated in the agenda for questions from Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| so I'll open it up if there are any additional questions from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Yes, Mr. Clabo, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| We talked about separate bike lanes, and usually these are marked off by paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| And the color that was added, for example, down on Central Avenue and Hapiana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| I think that's really beneficial and helpful to motorists and bicycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| as far as getting people's attention that these are designated lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| So continue those, I would think, whenever it was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Yeah, Mr. Clabo, so I've been long asking for buffered bike lanes, a big fan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| harassing people like Mr. Livengood since long before I was on Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| And one of the reasons that we couldn't have them is because we didn't have a street sweeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| Now we have the street sweeper, and it's out there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| It's in play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Okay, so what street widths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| I assume that's something that could be put more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| we could be putting more buffered bike lanes in where there's enough street width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| to go and do road diets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| What kind of widths are there, and are we going to see more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| We are definitely looking at buffered bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Some of the first ones that we're probably looking at are opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| where we might have existing bike lanes that are not buffered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| or maybe speeds are a little higher and you're not comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| maybe like a Hall of Fame drive, that type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| So we'll be looking at those opportunities first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| So prioritizing existing bike lanes that you can add vertical buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| I do like the contrast color, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| That's better than just white painted lines, I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I know one conversation that Mr. Livengood and I had one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| was about doing one on Broadway, like lower Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| which is about to reopen now that the Viaduct project is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| So is that still an opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Because I believe that's already a marked bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| That may be a long-lost conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| It's just a conversation we had pre-COVID, you know, everything changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Is that south of the Viaduct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| North of Fifth, I think, is what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| You recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| It was Fifth Avenue to the Viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Fifth Avenue to the Viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| So I take it that's still potentially on the radar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| and it would cross the bridge to get people downtown to Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| or just maybe depends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| It's been a long time since we had the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| I do believe it was pre-COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| While he's giving the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Getting that piece of equipment is a game changer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| I like that you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| And we just got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Go time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| We got it quicker, I believe, than we had even anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| I'll give you a general answer, and that is, now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| that's opened up the opportunity to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| where can we begin to prioritize these type of improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| John, you saw that John was the quarterback of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| and part of the reason there was such separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| is because we didn't have a sweeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| that could take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| With that, we can give you, I'll provide you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| where those upgrades will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| That has not been studied yet, I'll confess to you, in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| So when you say studied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| is that something we anticipate doing in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| or along the process of identifying sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| In-house along, as part of our overall process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Excuse me, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Okay, so Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| the viaduct is not going to have buffered bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| TDOT, would they, the cross section that they required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| we don't have enough room for bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I believe they're going to have a six-foot bike lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| across the viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| From 5th Avenue down to the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Sidewalk, is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| No, there'll be a sidewalk and then like a six-foot bike lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| but no buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Oh, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| From 5th Avenue to the viaduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| we have existing a painted buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| and that we can add vertical separation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| We will have to get permission from TDOT again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| since it's been so long since we last talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| but they did, four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| say that they would allow us to add vertical protection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| You asked about widths of protected bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| That's going to be driven by the width of the sweeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| which is, I can't remember exactly what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| but roughly the sweeper is going to sweep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| needs at least six feet of clearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| and then probably you're going to need another 18 inches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| or 24 inches of buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| So you're looking at at least eight feet per side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| to fit in a protected bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| If you were to do something like a two-way protected bike lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| where two-way traffic's all on one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| you could probably shrink that to probably 14 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| and fit it all in, but that, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| has challenges on either end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Can you give us your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| I'm John Lavingood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| I'm a traffic engineer for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| I'm just trying to unpack kind of the overall scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| I just want to make sure that I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| So in 2015, the study was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| 220 projects were identified at a rough estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| or estimate of $133.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| We've adjusted that to 2022 dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| but that's the number of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Okay, and so over a 10-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| and that 10-year window started in 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| So we're seven years in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| and 43% of those have been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Forty-three projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Twenty percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Twenty percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Forty-three projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Twenty percent in that seven-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| And I presume, I mean, 10 years is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| There are more projects that are being identified all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| That are being added to that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| So how do those kind of weave into sort of that 10-year study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| that 10-year window, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| And you bring up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| With the study being seven years into that horizon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| at some point we're going to have to go back and revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| and re-up what our priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| But typically, I'll go back to the same word, opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| We are constantly looking for opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| to get these facilities in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| And it comes down to a prioritization of right-of-way space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| We've had these discussions on all the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| Do we put on-street parking in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Do we put bike lanes in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| There's limited resource there as far as right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| and so we have to try to allocate that to the best use for each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| And then I presume some of those projects potentially become obsolete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| just because of infrastructure changes or that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| So I guess I'm just curious in that 10-year and seven years in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| is there a point where you go back to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| and sort of re-evaluate and re-prioritize within that 10-year window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| I think definitely at some point we've got to go back and revisit the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| and it really comes down to the overall network and connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| So we've still got that vision in mind as far as trying to make connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| It's very much like our greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| We try to get pieces of greenways in where we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| and then we try to make those connections to make it a path from A to B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Well, really two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| But in discussion of the plan for protected bike lanes on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| just one thing I wanted to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I was down there yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| there's a community of individuals who are using that space in a different way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| now with the viaduct closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| And we need to pay particular attention of what opening up Broadway is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| to do to that area, not only in the short term but in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| And thinking about how folks access resources on one side of the street to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| other and not wanting to block that access, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| with the protected bike lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| wanting to make sure there's plenty of crosswalks located in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| I think is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| That was just one thing I wanted to raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| And then in terms of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| I'm not sure if this was mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| It may have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| but changing of priorities and some flexibility there is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1886)|
| 0:31:36| And taking into consideration zoning changes that could have happened that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| will increase the number of pedestrians in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Well, let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Since this study has already outlined priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| how does it take into consideration those new changes to an area that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| require a sidewalk sooner in that area than this study had projected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Councilwoman Parker, when I began our discussion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| I indicated that we've got the word priority in some of these tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| and those priorities serve as a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| The prices that you see are based on general costs on a per foot basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| if you will, for the type of facility that we're putting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| When we believe we have the funding and the opportunity to go forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| these projects, we go back and look at zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Zoning can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Density can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Is it on the right side of the road, as an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| Those things are evaluated prior to going into the formal design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| What this does provide us is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| and I hope I'm going to say this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| budget guidance as well as priority guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| so that we know about what we need to have to acquire the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| and to construct any of these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| A lot of yapping on my part to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| I can assure you that these factors that can change over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| are a part of the evaluation before we push the go forward in design button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Mr. Clabo, looking at the infrastructure we have currently for bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| are you aware of how much linear connected bike lane we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2014)|
| 0:33:44| If somebody was to go on a bike ride and want to use the bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| are you aware of how long they could go on a bike lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| before they would end the bike lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| I know they're not all connected, but just in any one length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Right, and there is some mapping online as far as where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| and not only just bike lanes, but I think it goes to the overall system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| because sometimes it's a combination of bike lanes, greenways, shared lane markings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| So it goes back to trying to have a connected network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| but that's a lot of different pieces in order to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| Okay, and then you mentioned the complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Is that a rule with the complete streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| or is that more of an aspirational guidance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| It was a policy that came before council, and so the city adopted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| And so it really drives, it's our mindset as far as project development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| We try to incorporate all aspects transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| multimodal, bike, ped, vehicular in our projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| Okay, that's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And then when you're thinking about the bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I was wondering, since we have some narrowing of street for auto traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| is there some way of incorporating expanded bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| when we're thinking about traffic calming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2107)|
| 0:35:17| I'm not sure I follow your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Well, when we're dealing with traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| oftentimes folks are thinking about speed humps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| But there are other things you can do with regard to traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| One of them would be a narrower space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| And so I'm wondering if we could accomplish maybe two things at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| and have more expanded bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| and then in neighborhoods that wanted to have expanded bike paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| you could use that as a piece of the puzzle you're putting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| It definitely helps with traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| even if it's a perceived narrowing of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| And Coker Avenue, I think, is a good example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| We introduced bike lanes there on some wide pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| So it does give you a sense that the road is more narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| and I think that does help with slowing down traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| I'm going to ask you to comment just generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| on some physical barriers in roads that might be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| especially with traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| It's been my observation that it's really, really difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| to slow traffic down without some kind of physical barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| You know, people, you can try to educate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| If they're late, they're going to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| If they don't see a policeman on the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| they're going to, you know, do what people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| It's become part of our culture, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| But that kind of thing, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| the movement toward more physical barriers with speed bumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| And what I wanted to ask you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| was the traffic islands and traffic circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| I see some of those spread about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Some of them are outside the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Some of them are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Some of them are in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Could you just comment just generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| on kind of the approach that you're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| to traffic islands or traffic circles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| So, typically, we've used a few traffic circles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| which are the smaller devices that are put in the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| in order to slow vehicles down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| Our primary tool in the toolbox is a speed hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| It's very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| I think we've shown that's very effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| in slowing traffic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| I do think you make a valid point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| with just a painted bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| I can see there being a perception from vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| that the road is narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| but I don't know how effective that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| I don't think that would be as effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| as a speed hump or a device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| We have used some roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| We went over off of Washington Pike that we put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| We've put in a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Those are very effective devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| They're very safe as far as traffic movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| They also take up quite a bit of right-of-way, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| And those types of devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| when you get anything that's concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| they're much more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| and so cost goes up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Now, I think that goes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| to this idea of protected bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| Just back to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| that does the bike lane itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| and paint effectively slow down traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I'm not sure it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| and I think that's why people feel safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| or with a protection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| So, typically, when we're talking about protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| for a bike lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| it's some sort of either raised curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| It could be a plastic curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| It could be flexible delineators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| but a visual cue that tells vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| and the bikes that that's their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Okay, thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| I was just generally kind of getting some idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| because I do understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| and you more than me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| about the practical aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| of traffic circle will work here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| but it won't over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| An island with a tree planted in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| might work in some areas, but not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| So I just wanted to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| keep that on the radar screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| and where they're appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| and cost effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| We might want to look to adding more or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Thank you for the discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you, Deputy Director Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| We appreciate your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Mr. Hester is going to join us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| to speak to us about parks and greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| and greenway connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| and all kinds of good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| So we welcome you and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you, and as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| I'm the Director of Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| I'll be the first to wish you a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| Also wanted to highlight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| also here from Parks and Rec today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| is our Director, Cheryl Ely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| We're going to talk about greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| in four sections over the next few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| The first being the feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| that was done in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| We'll talk about recently completed projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Then we'll move on to what's currently funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| and coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| And then those future opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| that are out there for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| So the assessment study was adopted in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| A lot of people spent a lot of hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| developing this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| The City's Greenway Commission was heavily involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| There's at least one person in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| who was a participant in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| And many public meetings were held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| with various groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| including Bike Walk Knoxville and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| To develop this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| And this plan identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| approximately 24 miles of connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| And those that were connections in this context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| refers primarily to connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| from one greenway to another greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| or a greenway to a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| and or to a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| So just want to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| that that's what we're talking about in this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| as far as connectivity was concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Also want to highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| that there have come opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| for greenways that aren't part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And we'll talk about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| as we go through this quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| I did want to give a quick shout out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| to important partners to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Both the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| and Legacy Parts Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| provide us a lot of help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| particularly with easement acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| They do a great job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| And, of course, the bike club also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| does some trail building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| and key connections for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| between greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| So some recently completed projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| The Kauai Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| is an example of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| that's not in our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| and was done by a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| In this example, by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| And it was to satisfy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| a key connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| to allow university traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| to commute by greenway from campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| to the sports facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| at the end of Joan Cronin Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| without having to cross Neyland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| And that was a project that was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| entirely at KUB's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| So we can have greenways gifted to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| This is an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Once it was completed, it's now ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| We'll be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| for the maintenance of it going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Also recently completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| is the Northwest Connector Phase 1 Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| linking Victor Ash Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| to Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| This is a nice greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| We spent approximately 1.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| to build this half-mile greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| And this is an example of an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| and why it rose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| on the list of priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| The connection at Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| you may most be familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| with the pedestrian bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| built over Western Avenue by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| TDOT built that bridge at their expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| It became our opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| to connect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| Another example of a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| that's not in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| is at the Urban Wilderness Gateway Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| and the connection from the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| to Baker Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Cottrell technically is not in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| although we do have a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| in the plan for that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| But again, it's an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| of how projects develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| based on opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| The opportunity in this example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| was TDOT agreeing to give back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| the land that had previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| been used for a planned road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| and became park property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Projects that we have funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| going back to Northwest Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| phase two of that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| is currently in right-of-way acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| We expect to be in construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| sometime next calendar year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| with completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| by early of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| And that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| give us a greenway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| from Victor Ash Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| all the way to Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| and from Middlebrook to points beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| thanks to the greenway that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| This project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| is a $3.9 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Approximately 1.8 of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| is through a state-managed federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I will say the grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| from the state with federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| are great on these big projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| but they do add a layer of complexity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| which means time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| a project using these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| will take anywhere from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| five to seven years to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| We're also in design phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| for the East Knoxville Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| which will connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| from Harriet Tubman Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| to Dr. Walter Hardy Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| through the urban forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| and on to the Knoxville Botanical Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| This is a good example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| of how we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| vary from that plan somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| and still carry out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| the intent of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| the original connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| was not at Harriet Tubman Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| It was a couple blocks north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| and we wanted to include the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| not just because it's a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| but on the back of the Austin Home redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| which will also feature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| greenway connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| through that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| that will connect to the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| This is an example of being mindful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| of what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| in the whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| and adapting projects as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Also, the leg that goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| the urban forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| was not part of the original plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| but it's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| that we envisioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| recreational activities in going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| and this was a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| One, utilize that land along the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| but two, create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| a more pastoral experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| on the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| not a lot of pastoral area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| It's highly developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| with dense housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| so it was a great opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| as well as going through Walter Hardy Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| to get us off-road, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| The First Creek-Broadway connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| is a project we've been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| It's a third of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| but it's a very complex project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| and certainly the most complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| because of the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| because of the shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| because of the state highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| but it is moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| and hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| I've got timing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| I wanted to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| We're hoping to be in construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| by 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| so it is moving along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| and as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| we're wrapping up design now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| And then other funded projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| that we have coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| includes the South Knoxville Bridge Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| which is part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| It's seven-tenths of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| a $2.3 million investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| about $550,000 of that is local money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| The rest, federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| is managed by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| We also have greenway connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| being planned as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| the stadium project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| which will connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| the Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| development as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| And we're also starting to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| on Third Creek Greenway Extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| which will link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Jean Teague Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| to the new northwest connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| at Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| We're just now starting the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| of pulling our notes together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| to bid for a design team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| so hopefully that will be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| that council sees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| And then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| I can't stress this enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| additional projects will be planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| based on opportunities and funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Opportunities can be TDOT projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| Opportunities can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| other city projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| An example of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| As many of you are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| a major project from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| I-640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| I-640, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| Is in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| And this was an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| to include a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| And when you look at this typical here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| and it speaks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| what Tom was mentioning earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| how new projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| are being evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| for all users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Sidewalk, greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| bike lane, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| So we're excited about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| and that will add a nice connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| in that part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| of those 24 planned miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| we've built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| approximately 4.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| On top of that 4.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| there's another 1.3 green...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| miles of greenway that have been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| that's not part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| such as that example I showed you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| of the Kauai Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| and the Urban Wilderness Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| The estimated cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| for the remaining 20 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| which includes engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| property acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| and construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| is estimated in today's dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| at approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| $173 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| Questions if you have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Thank you, Mr. Hester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Let's see if I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| questions from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| So, Mr. Hester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| the slide you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=3019)|

| 1:06:47| primarily, we need housing and we've done this plan but, you know, in three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| a developer is going to come and say, I want to build housing, we need it bad. The zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| requirement only says I need to build so much but the next intersection is another quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| mile away. And so here we are at a log jam against a full list of priorities and an urgent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| need for housing and a barrier that is a lack of sidewalk. So, I don't know how to ask this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| question or what it even is other than it's a gap we have for the urgent need for multi-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| developments particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Councilman, I would respectfully offer that we're learning of a few gaps when it's coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| to housing. As we said in the beginning, this plan is a guide and that we've got to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4049)|
| 1:07:42| We've done our best, our consultants have done their best to anticipate some growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| but growth is also changing. We've experienced that. Councilman Thomas, the past three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| I believe we've had that discussion. All I can tell you from our department's standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| is we will take that into consideration and we will bring you recommendations as we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| done in the past. I do believe that this is one of those crossroads where we will also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4087)|
| 1:08:16| need to sit down with planning and that's not on their check box, if you will. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| types of things need to be a part of that and at least that discussion needs to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| part of it. And I think that's coming and frankly I think by council's discussions regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| the last matter, that probably is going to be bringing that to the forefront very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| That's not a very, it's a wishy-washy answer. I don't mean for it to be but we're kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| in that transition time with respect to that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| David Bray, COO. So it's a little wishy-washy but I think we do have a pretty clear answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| on how we're going to kind of knit all this together. So I think you're aware that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| Stephanie is departing, the mayor has hired and is appointing Amy Brooks to be the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| housing officer. The mayor has a strong desire because of a lot of needs and obviously the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| request from city council, how do we develop a comprehensive housing strategy, both low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| to moderate income plus market rate and then how do we knit together our infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| packages to support that and our land use and planning. So I think the interim answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| is we have flexibility to address projects as they come on board even though we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| this list of priorities. There's going to be some gaps but I think in the future we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| will start to knit together infrastructure and housing as Ms. Brooks comes on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Yeah and thank you for that. I know the TIF district in South Knoxville particularly provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| a unique tool but other districts don't have that, other zones don't have that so I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| think it's, you know, sidewalks are always a barrier that we hear from neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| when new development happens so it's a, I don't, it's not easy to solve but it's definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Coordination, connectivity and how do we make sure that infrastructure, economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| planning all come together so that we can get as much symmetry and alignment as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| I have two quick questions and then I'll be done. I'll pass the mic. Our new chief, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| of the, one of the, there were three bullets about, on a subsequent slide about which one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4217)|
| 1:10:26| got priority if you keep going. It was about, yeah, it may seem obvious to you but for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| why did the arterial and high volume roads with collector, collectors without sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| but why is that on there as a priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| So I think as we saw before on the pedestrian safety slide, those are where we have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| hot spots for the crashes so it kind of goes hand in hand where we have network gaps that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4244)|
| 1:10:53| we also have safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| And is another reason that these roads, I believe, are the types of roads that you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| have speed humps on particularly? Is that true too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| Yeah, high volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| I think of South Woodlawn and South Knoxville, for example, is one that it classified as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| this and I think it doesn't allow for speed humps so sidewalks is another alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| for speed calming. Okay, that was really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| And the last question I had was, although rare, there are some neighborhoods that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| necessarily want a sidewalk and so while it might meet a lot of these criteria, how do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| they provide that feedback so that it frees up funds for the, everywhere else, the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| 400 miles that need sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| I want to meet those people that don't necessarily want a sidewalk. I haven't met them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Ms. Bounds is here. There are examples, although rare, like I said, and there are good reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| for that but I just want to make sure that there's a mechanism for that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| And there certainly is. I can honestly say that if we're designing a sidewalk, you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| will know about it. We're not going to do it in the dark of night so you'll be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| to talk to your constituents and find out, you know, do they really want the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| and if we find out early on that they don't want it, we'll just go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| Council Member Ryder, I'm also interested in hearing from the people who don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| sidewalks. I haven't heard from them either, but you're next. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| She's out there. Already a one. Sorry, you may have other people. I just haven't knocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| their door. They haven't called me. Okay, sorry, it was shocking. It's really shocking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| So if you have the people that are asking us for sidewalks and they say, hey, the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4355)|
| 1:12:44| is in the plan, the guiding plan, not the cut and stone plan, and hey, I'd like to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4364)|
| 1:12:51| my yard up to make this happen. So you have a willing, and I'm not saying that's how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| prioritize it. Let's say that something rises to the priority, okay? Let's take an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| let's talk about a sidewalk you've already done, okay? Coker, recent project, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| it was a beaten down path for the kids going back and forth Fulton and Bellevue, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| I think is a great priority, kids to schools. So if you're like, okay, we've identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| this one is rosing to the top of the list for the 4th District. We're going to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| project. And you have these people going, me, me, me, I really want to make this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| happen. I want to volunteer my yard. So you've got a giver, a willing seller who wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| donate their right-of-way. How does that speed up and reduce the cost, I guess? Because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4414)|
| 1:13:42| have a lot of people telling me, I don't want this to be the barrier to keep the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| from happening. I'm not interested in you wasting money on appraisals. What's the pushing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| driving? Let's talk about right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| Sure. So when we make initial contact with a property owner, we will certainly tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| that they can donate, but we also make them aware that they are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| So they are told they can donate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| They can donate, but we also have to make them aware that they can be compensated. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| a lot of folks, whenever they hear that, decide to go for the latter option. But yes, if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| decide to donate, they are willing. We can do that. It does speed the process along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| If they're donating right-of-way, then we still have to go through all the legal documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| and everything to actually record what we need for the project. So that process might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| take a little bit of time. But then again, it might be one or two owners out of a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| of 12 to 20 that donate, and you may still have a few that, for whatever reason, don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| want to come to the table, don't want to donate, and those can make the process take longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| Okay. So if, let's say you have a string of properties that say, I do want to... You go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| to them first and you say, hey, we're identifying we're going to do a sidewalk here. You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| donate, but we also have to notify that we can pay you. Do you have to do the appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| if they say, nope, donate, I want the sidewalk? Do you have to go do the appraisal, is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| I'm asking. If they say, I don't want you to do the appraisal, I just want to donate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| I want the sidewalk. No, we don't have to. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| was a conversation from long ago. I either misunderstood or I thought the process was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| you had to appraise... I swear it was said to me. You had to appraise whether they said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| they would donate or not, even if they wanted to. Councilwoman, if I could interject. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| In some cases, it depends on the funding source. It may be that the funding source would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| us, even in a donation situation, that an appraisal is prepared for documentation. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| a city project, where it's 100% city funding, that's not the case, but it's very possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| that some funding sources would require us to... And how many of these we do with 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| city funding of our local new sidewalks? I can't give you a percentage. It's a mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| It truly is a mix. Candidly, we try to do as much with grant money as we can, the 80-20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| but it definitely is a mix. Okay. Councilmember Parker. Thank you. Back to a question that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4583)|
| 1:16:34| Councilwoman Singh had following up on that. When looking at health impacts and doing scoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4594)|
| 1:16:42| are you looking within districts? Are you scoring citywide? I don't think I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4602)|
| 1:16:55| When I say health impacts, do you know what I'm talking about? The matrix for the scoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| looked at a lot of things like age, incidence of diabetes, obesity. There were a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4621)|
| 1:17:08| of factors in there, and the data came from the CDC and also from the Census Bureau. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4628)|
| 1:17:17| then when you gather that information about residents, are you scoring them on a citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4637)|
| 1:17:25| basis, or are you looking district per district to see how individuals score according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| this health and equity analysis? I think it was citywide. John, can you provide additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4653)|
| 1:17:41| clarification? Census tracts is what I'm being told. So it's scored by census tracts, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4661)|
| 1:17:54| then that is one factor that's used to determine how to prioritize projects in each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4674)|
| 1:18:04| Yes. So the lists are still separated by district. Awesome. I think it would be useful to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4684)|
| 1:18:16| some sort of scoring tool report that would accompany funding requests for sidewalk projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4696)|
| 1:18:25| that come before us so that we know what priority this project is in a certain district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4705)|
| 1:18:34| if it has changed priority and explanation for why that priority change has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| I think that would be really helpful in helping City Council in determining what our vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4721)|
| 1:18:50| will be. Another question I had is if you all, just a request that you all send those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| slides to us. Yes, we will. Awesome, thank you. And then just a follow-up to the comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4738)|
| 1:19:10| that was made about neighborhoods not wanting sidewalks. There's a historically black neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| on Washington Pike that does not want a sidewalk on both sides of the road. And that's a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| costly sidewalk that could go towards funding other projects that are, that residents have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| prioritized for their area. Thank you. One thing I was going to mention, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4771)|
| 1:19:42| Seng, go ahead. Thank you. So, we're not just talking about connectivity, we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| about safe connectivity, right? Yes, the safety is definitely part of the four components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| that we're looking at in the analysis. So, we only have funding for so much to do sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4793)|
| 1:20:01| and greenways and bike trails. That doesn't mean people aren't going to still be walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| on the very narrow, dangerous roads that are throughout Knoxville. They're going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| to be that. Are there any other options that we have to make those paths safer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| Such as, do you have a suggestion along that line? So, and I'm trying to plug in here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4818)|
| 1:20:42| the reason I ask it that way, ma'am, is that a sidewalk or trail, you know, a trail would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| be an option that isn't a hard surface. We have to be a little careful for the accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| issues, but a soft surface trail, we've been putting those in through different areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| town to get places for people to walk. Separations keep vertical and horizontal. I mean, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4860)|
| 1:21:09| could say, well, let's make the road wider and just, you know, let them have a walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| path there. I don't think we want that. I think we definitely want physical separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| between the vehicular public and then the walking public. There's what we want and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4880)|
| 1:21:30| there's what we can afford and then there's also how do we keep the people safe that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| already there. If that takes a walking trail without a physical barrier, I mean, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| that can create some dangers, but people are already walking on that. Is there a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| of trying to land acquisition along some of these busier roads and before the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4906)|
| 1:21:56| goes in, at least there's a space that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| ...belongs to the city that people can freely walk on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| We can consider that without question. Maintenance becomes a factor. And in most of the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| that you're speaking of, I'm speculating and if I've misspeculated, please correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| Most of the areas off the edge of the road gets pretty steep. So trying to get a trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| and it's going to be an expensive venture no matter what you do, whether it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| Less expensive than a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| True, less expensive. But I think we all have to make a judgment call as to how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| that's being used, what the maintenance component would be. There's some other factors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| play into that. Are there options? Absolutely. And you're already seeing some of that go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| in our community right now by both the city and Legacy Parks and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| So I wonder if we can make a similar list with prioritizing and also like what's easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4970)|
| 1:22:58| to do where it's not, you know, a sharp drop off. If we can make a list of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| Yeah, I do want to say that we need to address safety concerns and there are things we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| do. There's lighting, there's signage, there's enforcement of speed limits. I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| say that we need to be careful that many of the folks that we're trying to meet the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| of are perhaps disabled or have accessibility issues. And so, you know, we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| sure that we develop an active transportation system that everyone can use. And so, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| also, so I know that I think Stephanie Brewer is in the back. So yes, we want to find solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| but we also don't want to put a path in and walk away thinking that, oh, we're good to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| go now. We've got to, so that's a little bit of a slippery slope. Where do we want to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| resources and buy property? I think we have made a very conscious decision that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| going to make an active system that meets the needs for everyone. I would also say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| yes, this is really, really expensive. We spend billions on roads in Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| the city of Knoxville for the last 30 or 40 years, right, for cars. And we've got to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| vehicles around town but we also need to continue to clamor for and fight for adequate funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| for other modes of transportation. And I think Mr. Cannon alluded to that on the first part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| of this presentation which is there's been a shift and we need to make sure that we fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| for, we secure dollars, we're looking at infrastructure money that's coming out of Washington right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| now. I know that Ms. Gill is working on a potential grant about connectivity and reconnecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| communities. So, again, I think we want to find solutions but we also want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| that we get, from a context perspective, adequate funding for these modes of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Absolutely. And I'd love to hear from you, Ms. Stephanie. But what is told to me so often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5082)|
| 1:24:51| on council is don't let good be the enemy of perfect. So sometimes how do we just keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| some of the people that are there safe? I understand trying to make it accessible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| everybody. But with what we have, with a goal to make a sidewalk there, with a goal to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| it accessible for everyone, at least start working towards it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| Councilwoman Singh, I would caution all of us on one factor and that is when we go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| and put in what I would call a temporary or interim facility, two things can happen. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| Mr. Brace alluded to it. Number one, well, we're done in that area. Let's go to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| area. Number two, I'll promise you it will be more expensive to complete that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5133)|
| 1:25:41| as it was intended with a hard surface sidewalk if you add in an interim step. Now, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| may be points where we have to add in that interim step and we can weigh those. But nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5148)|
| 1:25:56| times out of ten, at the end of the ledger, when you do temporary, then come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| do the permanent solution, it's going to be more expensive. And quite frankly, after you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| acquired the right-of-way and you've done the grading that needs to take place in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| to put in that pedestrian path, to finish it in hard surface is not that much more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| You've tackled a good chunk of the expense because the areas that you're speaking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| are typically terrain constraint. And that means more right-of-way for temporary easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5184)|
| 1:26:32| and things like that. I am not saying we can't do that. I just think I'd be doing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| wrong not to say we would need to proceed very, very cautiously in those specific cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| I think the couple of roads that we've talked about so many times, those don't seem like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| possibilities. I mean, there's a hill right there. I'd like to get that road fixed, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| That is truly, that is one of my goals, is to see if we can find funding to fix that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| and there's some others. Let's fix the whole thing right for both vehicles, bikes, and pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5220)|
| 1:27:08| It's just something I want to keep in mind, that we should consider what can we do because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| there are roads, Sims Road, there are always people walking there and that's not going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5234)|
| 1:27:25| So what can we do as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| I just wanted to go back to a point that I was trying to make and emphasize a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| Because what I'm trying to get an understanding of is really the criteria in place to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5258)|
| 1:27:47| how to prioritize these projects. And my concern is, if we, it sounds like we are trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5267)|
| 1:27:56| to serve equally each district to some degree. And my concern is that if we don't allow certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5276)|
| 1:28:10| factors such as this health and equity analysis to hold a little more weight and we push more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| towards trying to balance the budgeting going towards each district, then we may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5298)|
| 1:28:27| putting the sidewalks where there is the greatest need or prioritizing them for where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| is the greatest need. For instance, if we have a school district that's in a parental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| responsibility zone. But in one area of town, in one district, the residents are of a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5318)|
| 1:28:47| income bracket and are more likely to drive their kids to school. Another area of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| the residents may be of another income bracket and really rely on that public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| to get to work, to get to school. And so I'm just trying to emphasize, if we're not doing it already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| that this analysis has to have a greater weight and we shouldn't be looking to budget just equally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5348)|
| 1:29:19| across the board in each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| Councilwoman, let me speak to that. The intent was not to try to budget equally, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| And kind of evident by the numbers. If you look how it was broken down by each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| The reason it was broken down by district, that gave us the best mechanism to get feedback from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| and your constituents. It was a way to break up the community for feedback. That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5378)|
| 1:29:45| I don't know any other way to say it. And that seems to make sense because you all get that feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| from who you serve. And you get better feedback than we get. So that was the basis for the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| With respect to the prioritization, I'll tell you my number one priority. And that's safety, pure and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| If we have an area that people are getting hit regularly, that means there's a lot of walking taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| we're going to give that one heck of a high priority in bringing our budget forward for new sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| That is a must in my eyes. You speak to these school districts, I'm Presbyterian, but I'll say amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| Because the school districts must get good attention, particularly in the zones that you're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5424)|
| 1:30:31| So this is a guide. I can't overemphasize this. This is a guide to help us make good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5431)|
| 1:30:41| But we've got to get deeper into the weeds before those decisions can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| I just have one more comment. We have a lot of urgent needs in our community from housing, violence, interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| And those two particularly, we've taken action to dedicate funds on a reoccurring basis with teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5457)|
| 1:31:06| I would like to see, I don't know by what measure or how, or maybe it's just informal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5466)|
| 1:31:14| but the administration commit to any unfilled vacancies, for example, or any infrastructure projects that get pushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5474)|
| 1:31:23| I know throughout the year you reallocate those. We approve funding reallocation of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| I would like to see a more dedicated commitment to unrestricted funds that get freed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5489)|
| 1:31:37| go towards this huge billion dollar number in a more formal way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| I don't know what that looks like. It's not a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| It's just, I think it would be helpful other than the million dollars we see every year in the budget or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| I think it's between 250 and a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| I just wanted to comment on that. One of the things that Mayor McCannon asked us to look at was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| one, federal infrastructure dollars that are coming out of Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| And I know that Mr. Cannon and Ms. Gill and Fiona are all digging in on that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| to see right now what can we get funded to, again, build out some of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| She's also tasked us with looking at opportunities for some dedicated funding sources, some new dedicated funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5537)|
| 1:32:24| And so that will be something ongoing over the next year that we will be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| I would love to get to the point, Ms. Parker, where we could actually dig in district by district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| and have dedicated funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| We knew for the next 10 years we had $20 million to put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| or $20 million a year for the next 20 or 30 years just for Greenway's bikes and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| So she has tasked us with looking at that and being creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| So thank you for the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| Certainly the process that you're talking about with regard to these sidewalks I think is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| We've heard good conversation from council this evening about considerations with equity and health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5582)|
| 1:33:11| I'm glad to hear about emphasizing school parental responsibility zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5591)|
| 1:33:18| because I think that's an important piece that we need to continue to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| Connecting neighborhoods to parks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| I think all those are, these are the things that I think all neighbors want all across Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5605)|
| 1:33:34| is to have that level of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Certainly in the places where we've seen sidewalks go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| the things I've heard about have been about neighborhood connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| about seeing people walking through the neighborhood that live on a street across from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| that they never met and striking up a friendship and a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| Reductions in crime and overall value in the neighborhood going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| So all those are good things I think people want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| It's no surprise to any of us that we're hearing about sidewalks and people's desire for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| Or maybe when they don't want sidewalks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| So thank you so much, Transportation Chief McKeon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| Appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| I'll make a few closing comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| We're not quite to closing yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Can I make a few more comments and then I'll hush unless you want to ask me a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Councilman Parker, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| On my notes here, with the Vice Mayor's blessing and Will's blessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| you will get these slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I assume I have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| So those will go out to you all first thing in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| And Will will make sure that you have a copy for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| Number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| And number two's got two parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| First, I want to encourage all of us, and that includes us as engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5697)|
| 1:35:05| and Parks and Rec staff and planning staff, that we look at connectivity as one bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5705)|
| 1:35:14| Too often in the past we've looked at it in silos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| And connectivity has become more than that to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| And that's something that we should not lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| To that end, all these numbers, which totaled up to $2.3 billion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5727)|
| 1:35:35| are new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| This does not include facilities that have already been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| This does not include repairs to our existing facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| particularly those sidewalks in the older portions of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| where tree roots have caused them to heave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| You've got trapping hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| That's a separate budget altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| These are new sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Earlier tonight I asked you to write the number 22 someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| That, in this year's fiscal budget, that is the amount of true city dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5767)|
| 1:36:14| that you have afforded our department for capital projects overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| That includes repaving, storm sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Those are city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| And if you want to have fun doing some math, you can divide the 22 into the $2.3 billion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| and you're going to come up with about 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| If we dedicated every nickel that you have graciously given us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| dedicated it to our connectivity effort, let's go a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| If, by chance, we were fortunate enough for that $2.3 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5806)|
| 1:36:52| to be matched as we've had in other grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| where all we have to do is put up 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| all we're going to have to put up is a mere $461 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| I say this to say we've got to bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| And I'm cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| I'm not trying to say that the sky is falling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| but I respectfully ask council to consider this as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| and I'll tell you what we're doing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Most of the monies that we are afforded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| we've been fortunate enough to get that through the TPO mobility plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| This year, we were told, and Mr. Clabo and I spent a lot of time with the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| there was no more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| In fact, there had been an overcommitment of money for the region that our TPO serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| and they do a phenomenal job of stewarding those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| But because of rising costs on existing projects as well as projected projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| they had to say we had to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| And if you looked at the mobility plan, you will see some that fall into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| what's the word, Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| Illustrative projects, which, gosh, we hope to do it, but it ain't funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| And we're not seeing any funding in the near horizon right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5897)|
| 1:38:25| So for us to be able to add projects, we have to take one away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| Councilwoman Parker, to your point, we'll pick Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| because that was the first thing I had to tackle when I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| Again, I hear you when folks don't want to sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| In some cases, we don't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| If we want the road fixed and using grant dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| our state and federal friends are also looking for that multimodal component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| of what we're going after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| So I just say that as information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| But there's one other bit, and this is not meant to be a downer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Actually, it's meant to be a challenge to each of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| The funds that we have been getting through these grants are predominantly through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| and I'll have some folks get mad at me using this phrase, it's the gas tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| Pure and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| There's less fuel being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| We're getting more use out of electric vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| which are not going to stop at the gas pump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| That is a sustainable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| But there is a caution throughout the transportation industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| of how are we going to be able to continue to care for our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| How are they going to be able to continue to give grants for communities like ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| That's why we are aggressively, and you have this commitment from our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| and from Ms. Gill, from the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| we are aggressively going after other sources of grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| to begin to chip away at some of these dollars you've even seen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| We will have the commissioner of transportation in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| probably in the next 45 to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| He has a commitment, a strong commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| to this multimodal approach and to serving the four large cities in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6014)|
| 1:40:21| He is coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| USDOT has also got that same commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| We are working on getting them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| seeing if we can get in front of the line, at least the front of the line for some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| to go after DOT funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| We need the community's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| If they have connections, if they have ideas on funding, we're all ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| And I'm not saying that the rewards that we have gotten from the gas tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| are going to go away tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| That's not my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| But we do need to be thinking long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| particularly when we're talking about a scope of the nature that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| That's really all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| And obviously the folks who spoke before me, you enjoyed a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| But, Vice Mayor, if there's any questions for any of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| we're happy to stick around or however you would like to handle this, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| Thank you, Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| And, you know, your staff has done a lot over many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| with a relatively small budget when we're talking about new sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| I think we had a high water mark in 2017-2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| with just about $3 million for new sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| In the preceding six budget cycles, that's been as little as zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| but more likely about half a million, and then a million in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| And I know in this particular fiscal year, you had done a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| to try to make sure that we had a million dollars for new sidewalk construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| So I applaud you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| Obviously, when we think about the totality of the request here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| these numbers are not matching up quite well, as you had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| But I think it's important that we continue to do this intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| So I appreciate you bringing this to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| and thinking about how do we take limited resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| and put them in places that we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| And this is an important project with regard to sidewalks and connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| So thank you so much for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Dr. Cooley, BikeWalk Knoxville is going to visit with us for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6160)|
| 1:42:54| Dr. Cooley, we welcome you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| We're looking forward to hearing from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| Caroline Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Oh, this isn't council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| I don't have to say my name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| I'm Caroline Cooley, and I'm the president of BikeWalk Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| and I'm also the chair of BikeWalk Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| which is our statewide organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| I had several comments that I prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| and several of them have already been addressed by the various speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| And I want to thank them for a very detailed presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| on our current active transportation facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| and our plans for future projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| I would like to just highlight some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| and reiterate some of the important topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| as far as the future for the sidewalks, greenways, and bike facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6219)|
| 1:43:46| First, again, is critical connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| It's so important that we identify those critical connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| to allow people to get where they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| Right now we have several critical gaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| and so people report back to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| I got to Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| and I didn't want to cross Kingston Pike on my bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| So I turned around and went home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| So we have to find a way for people to get out of their cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| and be able to get where they want to go on foot or by wheelchair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| or transit and bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| The second is just the linkage of private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| and public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| That was brought up some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| and I think having a new model of where we don't sit in our silos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| will be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| One of the goals of Recode Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| was to promote higher housing density along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| that already have the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| that allows people to get around outside their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| And we have blighted property there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| that could be developed into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| and be accessible to the transit stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| accessible to grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| They can walk, they can bike to where they need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| and don't have to be dependent on a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| That should be a very high priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| And unfortunately, we have one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| I know you all haven't named it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| but one example of the Bruin Road development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| I'm very familiar with that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| because my dog swims at the Enskip Pool every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| the day before they close the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| And I've always noticed it's a terrible road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| for anyone walking or biking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| And the sharrows are just ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| It's on a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| And there's five acres of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| that's going to be developed into 120-unit apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| that are labeled as to help with the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6352)|
| 1:45:59| the affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| But people will not be able to walk to the bus stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| which is a good... it's not 450 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| It's over 450 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| It's about three-tenths of a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| from that location down to the bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| No sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| The intersection is not bicycle-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| It's not pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| So we have to link...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| All of a sudden now, Bruin Road becomes...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| all of a sudden goes up as priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| whereas other projects that have been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| may lose their priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| So we really need to focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| is this appropriate for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| the housing appropriate for the public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| as far as who's going to be using the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| who's going to be getting to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| who's going to be trying to get to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| So the last comment I want to make is on just safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| which we brought up, was brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| that that has to be the highest priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| and Vision Zero that we need to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| which we are doing, moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| with our Vision Zero campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| that focuses on enforcement in a selective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| We have a terrible problem with speeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| and I applaud the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| with trying to focus more on behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| that are dangerous to the entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| and I want to stress that we should not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| giving tickets to people for jaywalking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| We should not be giving tickets to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| for walking the wrong way on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| but we do need to have some enforcement of speeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| because it's killing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| We've had two pedestrian deaths in the last two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| on Kingston Pike and at Granger and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| We've had some serious cyclist injuries in the last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| and we can't blame...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| You know, maybe the pedestrian wasn't doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| what they should have been doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| but you can't blame the pedestrian all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| because we know that lots of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| that there's other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| One of them, of course, was someone driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| under the influence and speeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| and the other one, it was raining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| and we don't know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| I don't know the speed of the car that hit the pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| but the line of sight for that pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| was a good 100 yards on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| So we really need to focus on the whole picture of safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| and trying to make sure that we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| with that as our priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| And I guess that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| I do want to add, since I am a bicyclist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| that the bike plan from 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| a lot of those projects are outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| They're not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| We want more physical...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| There needs to be more physical protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| as Lauren always promotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| People aren't going to use bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| with just paint on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| Not with a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Thank you, Dr. Cooley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| and thank you, BikeWalk Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| We have no one signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| so that concludes our workshop this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| Again, thank you to all our presenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| and all those who joined us here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6568)|

| 1:49:33| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220818?start=6573)|
