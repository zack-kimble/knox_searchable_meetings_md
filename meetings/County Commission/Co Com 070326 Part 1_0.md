| 0:03:30| Michael Lee Dykes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| This is for Dixie Chicken at 8227 Chapman Highway for On Premises, formerly Swede's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=222)|

| 0:03:49| Are you Michael Dykes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| I'm basically here to surrender my permit to another person today, and they're with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| You're here to do what now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| You're here to surrender your license, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| We're going to put it in somebody else's name now, so I guess I need to know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| next move is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Well, the next move is whoever it is that wishes to apply for a permit needs to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| to the county clerk and make the application, pay the fee, and then their application will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| be presented to this board for approval or disapproval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| It'll be at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| So they would need to do that, you know, right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Well, I guess that's all I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Basically, what you're telling us today is you're withdrawing this item from the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Because you had applied for the permit, and now you no longer need it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| So you're withdrawing your request today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| As I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| We'll just defer that until...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Do we need a motion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| Do we need a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| For withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| So we're going to defer this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| So that's the end of that matter for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=324)|

| 0:07:53| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Do we need to approve pending the Fire Department report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| So what they're saying is those reports will need to be made and basically they will need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| to be positive in order for you to obtain your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=489)|

| 0:08:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=491)|

| 0:08:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Item A, Discussion of Applications Regarding LLCs and Corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| This was deferred from the February 2007 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Let me give you some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Let me give the board some information about this while we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| I'm just going to talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| I think it's Hassan that's on the news, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=541)|
| 0:09:28| Here are my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=592)|
| 0:10:10| As far as what we require of LLCs and corporations right now in order to obtain a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=610)|
| 0:10:19| they do not have to go through the same process, Mr. Minot and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| They do not have to go through the same process that individuals do in order to obtain a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| which is provide a photo ID, provide other information about perhaps their managing partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=631)|
| 0:10:43| for that managing partner then to be subjected to fingerprinting, background searches and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=643)|
| 0:10:52| As I understand it, that is currently not being done in the county for LLCs and corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=652)|
| 0:11:04| The city of Knoxville requires LLCs and corporations to provide at least the managing partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=664)|
| 0:11:18| or at least the manager at the site, say it's Kroger's, that's within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| Kroger's will have a manager who will be the person who requests the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| The manager then will present his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| That way we can put at least a face with the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| The manager then is subject to the limited investigation it is that we do, background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| and it gives us a little bit more information than we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| I have corresponded with the city, with Chief Owen and with others that are involved in the city process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=711)|
| 0:12:01| and they find that it is useful at least as far as gaining a little bit more information about the entity that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:13| that they are dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| It allows them to put a face with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| They think that it also provides a measure of, I guess, responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=738)|
| 0:12:29| If the manager is on the application, then the manager is more likely to conduct his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=749)|
| 0:12:38| or her operation with a stronger hand perhaps, maybe requiring training and all of that, as we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:49| and making sure all of that takes place timely, that they comply with the bare laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| It seems to be useful from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I asked if it had, you know, how did that procedure in the city originate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| And I've talked with their attorney, too, about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| and they're not really sure how the procedure requiring LLCs and corporations originated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Maybe it's that you had a certain employee who just decided, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| this is really the way that we ought to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| and so they initiated that process for LLCs where they require at least the on-site manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:30| to be the person applying for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| And, you know, pretty soon it becomes the way that we've always done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| But it seems to have worked pretty well with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| and it may indeed be a requirement that you all wish to impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| Chief Owen would also add that it helps a bit for homeland security type reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| At least you're gaining more information about who it is that you're doing business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| Currently, we don't require, you know, the photos or the fingerprinting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| or the background checks for managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| But it seems to make that person, whoever that may be, more responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=847)|
| 0:14:15| You know, that came up this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| I was stopped by one of my constituents and said that at a major food store like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| the guy was just belligerent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| He was drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| He was going through the line, and he was rude to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| And he told the girl, I hope you're not going to sell beer to this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| And sure enough, that's what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| They went right ahead and sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| And the manager came out and approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Do you need to get and bring something back to us next month then as to what we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| You and UK, I know UK, you've got some ideas on some of this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| Do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| I mean, if this board wishes to also impose the requirement, the same as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| you're welcome to do that today, and we can initiate that immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| We will change our form a bit, perhaps, to require a manager to also provide that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:10| UK, do you have any other ideas about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Mr. Chairman, I wish that you'd go ahead today and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| It's something that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| I believe it would help me and the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| It ought to have been done a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| It's more of a housekeeping matter, really, than it is a legislative matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| It's just that we have never really required it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part1?start=936)|
