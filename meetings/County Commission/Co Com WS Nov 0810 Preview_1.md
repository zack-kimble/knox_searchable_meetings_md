| 2:38:33| No, so we're still working with MPC on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9517)|
| 2:38:42| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| I wasn't sure how your rules were operating for your work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| Otherwise, I would have spoke up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| But again, my name is Elaine Davis, 913 Station View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9528)|
| 2:38:53| And I've been sick, so you'll have to forgive my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| But I wanted to just make a couple of comments and speak to Mr. Jarrett, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| We had in our prior ethics committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| we were under the assumption that the commission would make one appointment and the mayor would make two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| And then when I watched the commission meeting on television where you appointed the replacement ethics committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9551)|
| 2:39:19| you appointed two members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| So I wasn't aware of that until actually during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| But my concern about that is that it wasn't really delineated as to who you were replacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9566)|
| 2:39:33| And the importance of that is I believe that Mr. Daley has a two-year term of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9573)|
| 2:39:39| and Ms. Tucker had a three-year term of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| And so it may need to be rectified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| You may need to revote or somehow determine who's sitting in what seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9584)|
| 2:39:52| I had asked Mr. Lockett quite some time back to make sure that we had all of our seats somehow defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9592)|
| 2:40:01| either A, B, C, or 1, 2, 3, so this would not occur, so we wouldn't have this sort of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9601)|
| 2:40:07| But it has arisen, and we need to make sure that the people that you have appointed know the terms of their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9607)|
| 2:40:16| So you may need to somehow rectify whether Mr. Lewis is serving for two years or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9616)|
| 2:40:22| but that may need to be rectified on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| So you might want to check with Mr. Jarrett and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| I'm pretty sure that Carson's term was Mr. Daley's term was two years, but I know Julia's was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9628)|
| 2:40:35| Ms. Jarrett, can you look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| Most definitely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| This is the first I've heard about this, and we'll get right on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| I thought we had it tracked properly, but if there's an error, we'll fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| We just need to make sure that we have each seat specifically, you know, just as you have 1 through 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9646)|
| 2:40:53| we need to do something similar to that so that going forward as we replace everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| we know what their terms of service are, what the process is for selecting those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9657)|
| 2:41:02| and make sure that that's a clean process for everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9662)|
| 2:41:06| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| Any other things, any other business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| The other thing with regard to the task force, obviously Dr. Briggs and I really can't talk, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9673)|
| 2:41:18| Well, I think we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| Well, I was going to ask Mr. Jarrett, I was going to ask you to hang around, if you could, for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| This has nothing to do with business that's becoming before or an issue that we're voting on before the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| Can I talk to her about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| Well, you're two members of the same board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| So if you're going to discuss it, you should do it here during this open forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| because ultimately the ethics committee will probably have to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| I don't think they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| This is a commission issue, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| I'm not sure what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| It's about the formation of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9708)|
| 2:41:49| The task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9709)|
| 2:41:50| And just, actually, I was just going to ask questions about it, because this is the first that I've been made aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9710)|
| 2:41:56| You know, the ethics committee was not aware of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| and so I didn't think that we had anything before us this November meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9720)|
| 2:42:07| so I put that meeting off until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| So I'm not sure, were you wanting any ethics committee members to serve on that task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| or what were your general thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| I don't know what your scope is or what you're looking to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| We don't have any right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| I mean, what we're going to do is that that will be presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| I don't recall if you were here when that resolution came up, but I'll bring something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| But what I would, you know, I mean, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| I think we should have the chairman of the ethics committee as part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| and we probably need to have, you know, a representative from the sheriff's department, the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| Now, whether those need to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| whether those entities want to appoint their ethics committee members to be on the task force or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| I think that's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9770)|
| 2:42:54| But I guess my question is, what exactly are you trying to, what's your objective with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| What we're trying to look at is to decide do we want to change the way that people are put on the composition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9779)|
| 2:43:05| and how people are put on the ethics committee, and then what is the scope of the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9785)|
| 2:43:10| Okay, so are you looking to shrink that scope or are you looking to expand that scope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9790)|
| 2:43:16| That's what the task force is to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9799)|
| 2:43:20| So there's no clear-cut objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| It's just purely evaluation process of the ethics committee and its makeup and its duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9802)|
| 2:43:31| Yeah, we did this a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| You know, it was formed, it was one way, and then we, after a couple of years, it was redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| And I think it's time to look at it again because, as you know, we've ran into problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| where we've had large numbers of the ethics committee had to recuse themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| And there's been other times when we didn't recuse ourselves where we've been asked by attorneys to recuse ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| but we didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| Well, that was grandstanding in some regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| But that's, I just need to know how to prepare, what exactly you're interested in doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| so that way I can try to, you know, bring some information forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| Look over the, we're just going to look over the whole function of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| and see do we want to continue with it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| Commission says the task force would review and assess the composition, structure, function, power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| and authority of the ethics committee and make any recommendations to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9863)|
| 2:44:24| So you're looking at the procedural concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| You're looking at with regard how we do hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| You're looking at with regard to the scope of what comes before the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9869)|
| 2:44:33| Are you looking at what happens after that, after we have gone through a formal hearing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| what happens after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| Are you looking at how complaints are brought to us, just everything that's involved, comprised with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9879)|
| 2:44:44| I don't know how many things I need to answer yes to because I lost track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| I would say yes to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| That's my feeling, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9891)|
| 2:44:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9892)|
| 2:44:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9894)|
