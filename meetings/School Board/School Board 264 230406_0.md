| 0:01:25| We do have a lot to cover tonight, and I just want to remind everyone that this is the only time that this board has to discuss issues that would come before us as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=85)|
| 0:01:38| So we ask that if you need to have a conversation with someone sitting next to you, or that you step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=98)|
| 0:01:48| And we also ask that you refrain from any cheering, cheering, clapping, booing, all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| It makes it very difficult for us to hear each other, for others in the audience to hear us, and for those watching at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| And sometimes when we do have a lot of issues to cover that people are passionate about, you know, we see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| So we're going to ask you ahead of time to refrain from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| And we certainly don't want to ask anybody to leave tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| As Superintendent Reiswick announced at the work session, tomorrow, Friday, April 7th, and Monday, April 10th, are student holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=137)|

| 0:03:14| However, I could request that to be on our next policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| However, I need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Okay. Is it okay with you to do that, to add it to policy review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=206)|

| 0:11:40| These cadets are a reflection of all the great teachers they've had over the last 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=700)|

| 0:14:58| We just found out today, just a few moments ago actually, that Jamison Joyner, a senior at South Oil High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=898)|
| 0:15:07| will be receiving an Army ROTC nursing scholarship at Carson Newman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=907)|

| 0:15:19| and may upgrade that to a three-and-a-half-year ride based on his semester as a freshman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=919)|

| 0:16:18| This cohort of 15 individuals represents a variety of industries that they have had a first career in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| and then they decided to have a second career in teaching their various subject areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| and instill a passion in the students, prepare them for the post-secondary world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| and just equip them with all the knowledge and the skills that they would need to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| Today, they graduate, and we're very proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1005)|

| 0:17:04| not only in Knox County but also in partnering surrounding districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| and hopefully with our second and upcoming third cohort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| we're going to continue to welcome new educators into our profession, into our world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| and have a successful program going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1039)|

| 0:17:29| which school they teach at, and we got a little certificate for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1049)|

| 0:24:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Yes, we've asked kind of in lieu of everything the last couple weeks, just for Chief Perriard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| to come up and just give an update to the board just around security and just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| our whole overview of the security process that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| I just want to say before we get started that I've said from the beginning that security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| is the utmost importance for everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| We started back 10 months ago with Chief Perriard was there as well with Sheriff Spangler and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| with Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| We held our joint press conference around safe schools, safe students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| And that wasn't a PR move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| That was like a legit thing because we mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| And everything that we do and the conversations that we have with people, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| It's our number one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| I also want to say this, that the decisions that are made in leadership around security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| and around every one of these things that we do every day are not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| They're extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| But we will continue to lead and make the right calls to keep our students and staff safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| And I'm appreciative to work with Chief Perriard, who I know takes that very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| And between he and Dr. Adams and our team, we've spent a lot of time, especially recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| and any time, even things that you all don't hear about, working on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| So I appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| And thank you for the update tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1540)|

| 0:25:48| I want to thank Chairwoman Christie for inviting me to address the community in regard to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| Knox County School security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I know many of you have fielded questions from concerned parents and students on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| we as a district are doing to keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| This is understandable, especially in the wake of the horrific attack on Covenant School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| in Nashville that claimed the lives of six of our fellow Tennesseans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| As Chief of Security for Knox County Schools, it's my job to ensure the safety and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| I want to be as transparent as I can be about our operations and strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| However, while I can share some details regarding our processes and methodologies, I will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| be discussing nor will I confirm any specific mitigation strategies, equipment, or security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| tactics we deploy at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| While I understand and respect that we are public servants, we simply must refrain from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| having public discussions surrounding specific security measures that we could be utilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| that could be utilized to gain access and harm our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| I not only say this as a 32-year veteran of the military, security, and law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| but as the father of a Knox County School student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| I want to talk first about the state of our security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| First, I want to applaud Governor Lee's recent statement on school security and the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| efforts behind HB 322 and SB 274, which I am closely monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| These measures are a crucial baseline security strategy for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| In fact, I'm pleased to report that KCS has already adopted these strategies and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| already 100% compliant with these measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| Regardless of this fact, our division has never been satisfied with just enough and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| has sought and is seeking ways to constantly improve our safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| For instance, since assuming the position of chief in 2021 and with complete support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| from KCS leadership, I have set out to increase capacity and modernize the operations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| equipment of the division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| This was highlighted in the FY 23 budget, where the board approved a $4.7 million increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| in our security system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| This resulted in many improvements, including a 20% increase in our SSOs, or school security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| This larger deployment strategy has already resulted in an increased presence throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Some of you might have noticed already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Flexibility and protective posture and the capacity to respond to multiple threats throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| And now, how do we continue to get better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| I wanted to kind of lay out just briefly what we do every single year to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| In compliance with state law, our division facilitates an annual security assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| that evaluates the current state and safety and security at each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| These plans are reviewed and drilled periodically with our LE partners throughout the year to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| drive further improvements and prepare for the most likely hazards our school may face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| This is a recurring process that drives all kinds of further trend analysis, and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| reports for trend analysis actually inform our spending agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| So we do these things thoughtfully, methodically, and we seek other funding streams as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| to make sure that we can meet those challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| And now the following is a list of broad-level security improvements that have been implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| or are being implemented through KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| In other words, this is what I can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| We have increased armed SSO presence throughout the district, mobile and foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| We have upgraded security equipment for our SSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| We are working on advanced physical security measures at schools throughout the county as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| Advanced operations software to drive resource management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| Updated threat assessment procedures and software for more efficient risk assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| Additional upgraded cameras both around and on our SSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| And crisis communication systems and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| And finally, new information-sharing networks for tips and leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| This is as specific as I can get with our operations without jeopardizing the safety of our students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| It's important to note that our office also provides regular security advice and services daily to our school administrators and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1819)|
| 0:30:27| As the threats change and the needs arise to reevaluate our security priorities, we conduct walk-through evaluations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| and meet with leadership to discuss challenges unique to our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| And I brought my physical security specialist with me so she can meet you all at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| She's done an amazing job, and we're just so proud of the program we're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| Now, from the outside, you may be able to notice some of the security changes we have made, but some you will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| And that's by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Despite this fact, the strategies we employ at each school reinforce its strengths and mitigate its weaknesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| Finally, I want to speak about our school security officers and staff, who I'm the most proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| It's been my experience that the men and women of KCSD are dedicated, adequately trained and equipped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| and prepared to handle any security situation they face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| I am immensely proud of the work they do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| In concert with our amazing partnership with Knoxville Police Department, Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| the community can be confident that we are doing all we can to ensure a safe and secure learning environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| for our students and staff at Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Thank you for coming tonight and for giving us that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| I do think, and I appreciate you saying it, I do think that some people lose sight of the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| part of a school's safety plan is not to publicly discuss the safety plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Because that can sometimes put students at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| So it is difficult at times when people want to know very specific things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| and they come to us as board members asking those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| So I do appreciate you including that in your update as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Ms. Henderson has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you for being here tonight, Chief Perriard, and thank you for all your officers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| You guys are in the front lines, boots on the ground in our schools, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| This last week has been incredibly hard for Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| And as a mom, I try to come from things from a parent perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| I do have two Knox County students at Hardin Valley Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| and I felt the fear, frustration, and anger that occurred this week in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| I think that it's time to heal and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| And I just want to thank Superintendent John Risely for coming to our school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| coming into our community and listening to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| With that said, I do have concerns about what happened at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| So I'm looking forward to the results of that internal investigation and the transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| so that parents do have answers to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| And I want to close out the 2023 school year focused on keeping our students safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| That's priority number one is keeping our students and staff safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| and helping them succeed in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| One question I do have is just around students who make threats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| I know that has been pretty prevalent, especially this week at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| Can you kind of address just kind of what happens with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| It seems like students make threats, and then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| Unfortunately, what happens is they're usually booked and charged for making terroristic threats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| This is a new era for us, and I know as parents, you know, when I send my son to school every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| I tell him, you know, it seems like every weekend we're talking about what words not to use, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| You can't talk about bombs anymore or guns or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| So we as parents have to be very intentional about those discussions with our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| because although we have a really good response process through the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| and we try to gather all the facts and context is important, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| If the kid just makes a fun thing on the playground, it's different than writing a manifesto, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| But the police department and the DA's office have taken a very hard stance on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| You are putting people's lives at risk even if it's not intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| When you make a threat, you're expending resources, massive resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| You're making everybody, you're traumatizing the student body and the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| and you're disrupting the educational process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| And frankly, the community seems pretty united from what I've heard at a very hardline response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| That being said, it's important to parents to talk to their kids like I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| because kids are fallible, they'll make mistakes, and they do the dumbest things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| But there are certain red lines that we make sure our kids don't cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| and that is there is no such thing as I dare you to threaten somebody with their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| or shooting schools up or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| We just have to be really cautious about our words because we at KCSD and KPD and KCSO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2126)|
| 0:35:35| we will take every threat seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| I mean, we just don't have a, we don't know what intent is behind that threat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| and so we have to take every single threat as a serious threat until proven otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| So unfortunately when you do see us respond in large quantities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| and we're putting out all these resources and we have bomb dogs and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| those things are done out of an abundance of caution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| because we've learned from history that the one time we don't take things serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| a teacher gets shot in the stomach or something really bad happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| So we have to take every threat seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| I appreciate that, and I completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| One thing that I want to see come out of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| some things that are going on in the next couple weeks is, you know, what can we do as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| what kind of got missed, what got overlooked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| and how can we as a board just fortify those policies or procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| So I look forward to working with you on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=2194)|

| 0:50:34| not just a select few and certainly not just your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| So whether if this school will affect your district or be located in your district or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| I think is something that really should not be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Just what does this do holistically for the student population within Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| I will also add that there are some things that really have been misrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3055)|
| 0:51:03| As a member of this community, a resident, a pastor in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| and a member of several organizations, not just the NAACP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| I do know that it has been put out there that there are some entities in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| particularly in East Knoxville, that have given voice as a sort of endorsement to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| That is not true in many instances, as it has been represented to you and to the public in many instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3085)|
| 0:51:35| So I think we need to also just consider the culture of ethics from these applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| That they have not been the most forthright in whose support they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| Have not been the most forthright in what they know will be the effects on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| and have used the present policy of charter schools to their advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| To, for lack of better terms, to be deceptive to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| And so as a representative of the oldest and boldest civil rights organization in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3125)|
| 0:52:13| we would ask that you would please, please consider the implications of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| And just appeal to you in a more practical way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| I know they said they possibly found a loophole in the Title IX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| I am like 97, 98 percent sure if you all pass this, there will be a Title IX lawsuit down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3149)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Annabelle Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| Thank you. I'm Annabelle Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| I'm first going to read a letter from an East Knox County teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| I think you have a copy of it in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| She wanted to remain anonymous, or he, I don't know which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Dear school board members, as a teacher at a school in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| I implore you to not vote to allow the opening of any charter school in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| Our East Knox schools are already underfunded and understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| We operate in buildings many decades old with the problems inherent in aging structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| We don't have the PTA or community partner support that many other Knox County schools enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| Additionally, we have numerous students who experience trauma and hardships in their daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| Gun violence is rampant in our community, leading to even more student trauma and anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| The last thing we need to do is have money taken from our school and funneled into another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| We need more funding, not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| We need more students, more counselors, more behavioral support staff, more library books, and more classroom supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| We also don't want to lose students from our tight-knit school community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Splintering our community into inequitable schools is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| Strengthening our existing schools is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| I suggest that if anyone would like to invest in our East Knox kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| they can use their money and time to support and strengthen the schools and programs that are already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| I guarantee it will be incredibly appreciated and the funds very well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| Please vote no to charter schools in East Knox or anywhere in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| Keep KCS funding where it belongs, in our existing schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| with teachers who work harder than any group of people I've ever known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| and with kids who need more support, not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| Thank you for your consideration, an East Knox County teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| And now from me, I've been thinking a lot since Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| I heard the representatives talk about their why being community requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| that lots of people begged them to come here, but I don't see those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| I heard them say something about a large number of local community members that support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| So I looked at the log of people that they either met with or attempted to meet with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| checked in with them, and most of them said no, we're not supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| Accuracy and truth are important, and it's not what I'm getting in these claims of community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| If we're not receiving accuracy and truth now, what can we expect in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Pam, and I'm sorry, Pam, I don't want to butcher your last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| but can you state your name, county of residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Pam Laskowiak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| I totally understand your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| I would have not gotten that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| I'm going to read a letter from a constituent who couldn't be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| and then also speak myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| This is from Brianna Holloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| I'm sorry, are you from Knox County, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| Yes, I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| I live in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| I am also a Knox County resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| and the person I'm reading on behalf of, Brianna Holloway, is also a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| As a parent of several Knox County school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| and former candidate for District 1 school board seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| I am asking that the approval of a new charter school be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| I expressed several times during my campaign that charter schools are merely cloaked private schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| draining public funding from already underfunded and under-supported schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| especially the ones in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| If a tire is flat, you don't buy an entirely new car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| you fix the tire and keep rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| We must fix and fund what is broken before we add another charter school to this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| Gun violence is another topic that I have been publicly vocal about for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| There needs to be very honest and transparent conversation about safety of our children in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| I stand by my opinion of keeping armed officers in every Knox County school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| not arming teachers and banning military-grade weapons from being accessible to ordinary civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| These are the words of Brianna, and I would just say in my own words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| that I would like to keep public money in public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| and that this charter school coming from another place, not from our county, not from our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| is not in the best interest of students here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| I think that if you spoke to constituents and asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| do you want your money to go to other things than public schools for every child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| I think your constituents would say that they do want their money to stay in the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| and not go to charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Next, we have Amber Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Amber Roundtree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3451)|
| 0:57:47| I'm Amber Roundtree. I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| I come to you tonight as a parent, former Knox County educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| former member of this board, and an education scholar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| I'm asking you tonight to vote no against Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| After three decades of peer-reviewed research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| there's a lack of support for charter school outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Any possible benefits have been negated by the negative impacts to our public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| students of color, and students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| What is the research support for their Teaching Boys Effectively logic model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| The results are dismal, frankly, from what they're doing in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| Only 37% of their students scored at or above proficient for math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| and only 17% above that for reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| So I think when we think about the district's strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| how is this helping achieve that goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| Because in that plan, it does state that we're going to engage our whole community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| to use research and evidence-based practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| So four peer-reviewed articles does not a research practice make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| And then I want to speak to Mr. Brown's point about Title IX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| There is a lot of research, and if you are following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| there's actually a current case at the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Mr. Dupler may be aware. It's Peltier, the Charter Day School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| And the Fourth Circuit Court found in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| prior to it being elevated to the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| that North Carolina could outsource its educational obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| and later ignore blatant unconstitutional discrimination committed by those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| We need to look no further than the shameful history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| of state-sponsored racial discrimination in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| to reject an application of the Equal Protection Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| Powerful words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| As you heard, the NAACP does not support this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| Representative McKenzie does not support this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| I hope you will seek more answers from the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3596)|

| 1:00:48| Next we have Candace Bannister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Welcome, Candace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3651)|
| 1:01:00| Hi, Candace Bannister, Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| It took a while for me to reflect on all I heard Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| It's so easy to be distracted by all the talk of bells and whistles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| because, after all, it is kind of a sales pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| For me, it came down to three concerns regarding Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| CHAT Prep had only 21% economically disadvantaged students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| in a 2021 state report, with a number that low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| It doesn't seem like the mission of the school is to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| with economically disadvantaged students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| though that certainly seemed to be the case when we had the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| on Monday, March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| The average testing score for CHAT Prep was 20.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Not only does it not seem like this school is positioned to raise the scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| of our students here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| students with those scores would be required to be in the RTI intervention program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| and if they were third graders in our state this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| they would be retained in third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Being successful at raising scores requires being well above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| and beyond the cutoff for intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| With the new TESA funding of somewhere between $10K and $14K per student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| KCS would be sending about $1 to $1.5 million to Knox Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| in its inaugural year, considerably more by the time it fleshes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| to seven grade levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| For every dollar Knox Prep would take, some students in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| would be getting less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| There are approximately 4,000 sixth-grade students in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| but only 105 of those sixth-graders would be accepted to Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| That's a very low number of students to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| for such a large number of students to have to sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| It almost feels like Willy Wonka is coming to town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| and passing out 105 golden tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| Where are the people who want those tickets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| They weren't here Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Why aren't they here begging for you to authorize this school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Chad Prep made 60 trips here, so where's the support to bring them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| While having a contest with golden tickets to visit a chocolate factory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| is acceptable, it's even fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Having students have to play a lottery for their education is really not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| Again, please exercise your duty to act and vote impartially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| for the good of the Knox County school system and its students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Madam Chair, this concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3797)|
| 1:03:24| Do we have a motion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| We have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Discussion? Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| We're doing that. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Discussion or motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Can we make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| A motion by Mr. Triplett to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| A second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Discussion on that? Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| I think I was not first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| I wasn't first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Let me look back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| Jennifer, are you first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Before we do this, Mr. Dupler probably has some clarity to add to just the charter laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3846)|
| 1:04:17| and the process if it were to be approved or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| I'm not feeling the best, so I'm just trying to hang in there as long as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the board and to impart some more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| after the robust discussion on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| First of all, there's two what I would call immediate legal issues at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| The first is Title IX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| There's been a lot of discussion about Title IX on Monday night and some conversations since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| I've had a very frank discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| As I stated, I know Chris McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| I would call him a friend, but he does represent the Knox Prep and represents school systems across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3899)|
| 1:05:09| We had a good discussion about Title IX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| We talked about the potential exceptions under Title IX for a single-sex school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| There are exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| Does this particular situation fit neatly in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| That's debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| There's one exception that talks about if a charter school is its own LEA, they're accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| Well, in this case, if the Knox Board of Education accepts the charter school, then it's the LEA, not the charter school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| so that doesn't quite fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| There's another exception that talks about more along the lines of what they're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| which is simply a single-sex school geared toward college prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| And there's cases either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| There's not one that's going to just say, bam, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| So there is the ability to debate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Certainly there's no challenge in Chattanooga because they have an all-girls school right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| Does there have to be an all-girls school here in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| That's not really decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| OCR seems to put out some guidance on that, but there's no case law directly on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| All that to say, and both Mr. Riccardi and I agree upon this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| if there were a lawsuit, and frankly anybody can file a lawsuit at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| doesn't mean it's going to be upheld or it's a good lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| But if a lawsuit were filed under Title IX, the Knox prep folks would be the primary defendant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| and if a court were to say that they violated Title IX, well, what would the remedy be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| The remedy would be that there would be no Knox prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| That would be the remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| So that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| The other question that came up was, you know, what's going to happen tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| And that's a good question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| So on the agenda it talks about discussion and possible action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| on the recommendation of the charter school application review team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Well, if you look at the specific code on charter school applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| it says that the local board of education shall rule by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| at a regular or specially called meeting to approve or deny a public charter school application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| It then goes on to say that the grounds upon which the local board of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| based a decision to deny a public charter school application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| must be in writing and must specify objective reasons for the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| So what does that mean to this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| What it means is, as you all have heard many times, five votes get you what you want, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| But you have to have five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| So if there's five votes to approve tonight, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| the board can easily produce a resolution that says approve and things move on, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| If there's something less than that, that's where we get into there could be possible concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| You know, at the very least, it's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| As we all can see right now, there's only eight of you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| So if there's a 4-4 tie, then the motion would be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| And the question is, where would you be able to find the objective reasons to deny the charter school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4117)|
| 1:08:46| Maybe from the discussion, but again, I think Mr. McCarty believes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| and it's certainly a good argument, that you would have to have five votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| to come up with some type of objective reasons that would be then put into writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| So a 4-4 tie or less than that, you know, perhaps 4-3 with a pass or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| doesn't get you to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| So all that to say is if there aren't five votes to approve tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| then our office would have to recommend that the board take this up at a time sometime before May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4159)|
| 1:09:29| obviously because May 1st is the deadline, to look at it one more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| perhaps when all members are here, and then come up with a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| If it is denied, that states the reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| All right? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| Right, and just to clarify, because you and I had this discussion as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| and I know that the Chattanooga prep students are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| They made the long journey again because they wanted to see this to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| I would hope that we could complete it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| But it's my understanding that if the application is denied without reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4208)|
| 1:10:16| the reasons weren't approved and there is no further action on May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| it would by default become a charter. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| So the code does say that if there is no action one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| either an approval or denial, then it is approved by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| So in that scenario, that would be what would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| If there's…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| If we, if the board, if it's the will of the board to move forward, let's say just theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4247)|
| 1:10:55| and I'm not so confident that it will be a 4-4 split, but let's, theoretically speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| and the charter is denied, and then we move on to having to vote for reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| because I do feel like that is the next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| and then all of those reasons fail because you have the same 4-4 split,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| that would be an inaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| That would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Yes, yes, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| That would not be, I mean, at the very least it would be problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| and I'm sure that the applicant would claim that it was not a proper decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4288)|
| 1:11:37| I just wanted to make everybody fully aware of that too, should that move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| I have a question related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| So I just want to make sure that I'm understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| If it is a 4-4 split tonight, regardless of whether or not we can approve the reasons why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| because I don't know that you stated this, Mr. Dufler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| but the reason to state the reasons why is the applicant then would have to be able to remedy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| those reasons in their application, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| The code talks about providing those written reasons why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| so that the applicant can then take 30 days to submit an amended application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| and then the board would have another look at the amended application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| So in the event that it would be a 4-4, that is not a denial of the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| it's an action related to the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Well, again, that's what the Knox Preps Council is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| I mean, I don't know that I entirely agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| but I would say that if the motion is denied under a 4-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| then to me that indicates a denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| but it still creates a problem when you're trying to come up with the objective reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| Because you likely would not be able to get to an approved list of whatever the reasons were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| If you have a 4-4 deadlock for all the reasons, as Ms. Christie stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| then that would be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| So maybe I'm being simplistic in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| but what it sounds like is that really state law is saying that for any denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| there's actually two actions you have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| You have to deny, and then you actually have to approve a set of reasons for the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| Is that, in effect, what the law is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| Well, I mean, it's confusing because, I mean, it could be all one action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| It could be all one action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| But right now, that's why I referred to what the board has on the agenda, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| Right, because there is no resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Because the board doesn't have a resolution on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| There's no resolution for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| I mean, the board hasn't discussed an impossible, possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| It doesn't mean that action has to be taken tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| But now there's a motion to approve, so now you have to deal with that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| But, so, I mean, there's got to be a, if there is a denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| there has to be written objective reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| And I'm sorry, just to be clear, I'm assuming I don't like this is not an objective reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| I just want to make sure that's…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| That would be, yeah, I think under the law that would be challenged as an objective reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| I think that's important because I think all of us in this room have different reasons why we would be for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| Some of them are more subjective than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| And I think what the law is telling us is that whatever the reasons are, they have to be objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| They can't be subjective or personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| That's what the law literally says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| It would be hard to address that if you were coming back with a…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| Yeah, you can't rectify that in an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| I believe Ms. Owen, you were first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| And this is just a question for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| This is not where I was going to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| Since we have had an open deliberative process Monday and we are having an open deliberative process today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4503)|
| 1:15:11| of which we have a video recording and copious minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| could the administration not take those objective reasons from the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| When we've had discussion, I think the administration would be able to look at the minutes and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| well, that's how that person feels, that's a factual reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| and could find those objective reasons and pull them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| But, I mean, again, to me it's a gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| I mean, you know, I think Knox Prep, frankly, could challenge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| I mean, so that could be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| But what you're saying could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| And Mr. Dupler, I would think that board members who weren't aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| or might not have realized that the voting on those actions might be something they had to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4560)|
| 1:16:09| might not have voiced, I don't like that action, you know, I don't like your reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| Like, we didn't really debate reasons that people gave or didn't give, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| I mean, up until now you've had a discussion, you know, because that's what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| But, you know, somehow from the record you would have to have some objective reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| But does it say anywhere that we would have to vote on those reasons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| Because, I mean, a reason, Christy could give a reason and I could give, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4599)|
| 1:16:47| Ms. Christy could give a reason, I could give a reason, Ms. Byke could give a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| We could each give a reason that we might not all agree on, but those might still all be reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4611)|
| 1:17:00| I mean, again, I think that's a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| But I think that would be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| I mean, Knox Prep's council has said that they feel like that the board needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| forwardly vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| How have other districts done this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| How does Nashville do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| It's by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| So, you know, often what you see is you'll see a board vote on the resolution up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4643)|
| 1:17:31| And then sometimes they'll have two different resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| One's up, one's down with the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| So whose responsibility would it be to bring that resolution for us to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| We do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| I mean, where is, why has that resolution, is it the committee's responsibility to bring a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4664)|
| 1:17:51| Who is supposed to draft that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Point of order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Yes, Reverend Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| I think that we are avoiding the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| It says that we have to have a resolution if we deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4681)|
| 1:18:10| So the resolution has to be written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| And then if we vote on the resolution with the reasons in the resolution, then that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4692)|
| 1:18:20| That's how we did a resolution for our legislative statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4700)|
| 1:18:27| And so we worked on that until we had the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| So if we have a discussion where there are reasons for not to approve, then those things will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4710)|
| 1:18:41| So I think what we need to do is just go ahead and jump in the pool and have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| Yeah, I think, you know, and there's nothing saying that we can't write the resolution tonight if we need to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| If we have to vote up or down items, that is how you would plug that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| You could write a resolution based on things that the board agrees on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Yeah, and there's nothing, to Ms. Owens' question, I mean, there's nothing in the state law that says that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| one particular entity does the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| It's just the board's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| So ultimately it's up to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Any discussion then, Ms. Owens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| That's all thrown my brain really far off now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| So I have multiple thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| We'll see if I can get them back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| So we all know that it's the superintendent's responsibility to ensure that board members have all the necessary information to make informed decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| But for the review of charter applications, that responsibility is necessarily delegated to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4788)|
| 1:19:55| But the committee, I'm not sure, has delivered all of the information that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| If we were managing a business and being asked to hire an employee who did not include all of the necessary information on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| I don't think we would consider that person for very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| And if we want to go back to the analogies from Monday, what we're looking at right now is not an application for a barista position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4814)|
| 1:20:22| It's an application to hand over 700 of our students 100% into their care with the expectation that their education will be thorough and complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4822)|
| 1:20:35| With that in mind, there's some serious factual discrepancies throughout the application for NOXPREP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| And this calls into question how thoroughly these claims were vetted and if they were vetted at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| On Monday, Ms. Thompson told us that each committee member was expected to do their own fact-checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| Keep in mind that was a 377-page document, and they were each expected to do their own fact-checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| Yet in my own fact-checking, I found that the committee members were not told that they were tasked with ensuring that the 377-page application was factual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4858)|
| 1:21:08| I've pulled out some questionable parts of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| This is in no way a complete accounting of the claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| This is just some bits and pieces that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| On page 8, citation 1, the Fulton graduation rate lists only the graduation rate for 2020-21, the first full year of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4880)|
| 1:21:28| If you look back to the 18-19 numbers, the rate from the same source was significantly higher, almost 10 points higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4888)|
| 1:21:36| Page 8, citation 4 and 5, the data is from a new Sentinel opinion piece that has no references to the source or time period that it may be from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4896)|
| 1:21:46| And that's for both of those references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| On page 9, citation 6, the reference to the demographic makeup of Western Heights comes from an invalid URL when you click on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4908)|
| 1:21:56| On page 10, citations 9 and 10, it lists KGIS as the source of information regarding the location of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4916)|
| 1:22:06| and sort of implies that Region 5 is a geographic location as well as synonymous with Commission and Board of Education voting districts too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| And we know that that's not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Additionally, the claim that this is a response to community and demand need with no data to support that claim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4936)|
| 1:22:23| no meetings of any local neighborhood associations and no survey data, also pulls that into question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| And the reference that is there in the application is a link to an article in which that claim was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4951)|
| 1:22:39| So that's not an adequate citation for that claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| On page 11, citation 16, the application says the location and community has been purposely selected to closely mirror the student population at CHATPREP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4965)|
| 1:22:55| with 80% of students living in low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| In the citation, what the citation says is that the 2021-22 report card inaccurately reports the economically disadvantaged student enrollment rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4979)|
| 1:23:11| and says 78% of CHATPREP students are economically disadvantaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| So it's unclear whether it's the 80% that's the correct number or the 78% that's the correct number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| However, there's no reference back to where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| If you go to the state data and pull out the school profile data from that same year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5006)|
| 1:23:33| and it says on that that it is updated from 12-6, so in December this is updated data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5013)|
| 1:23:40| And what we see there is that the state appears to say that the number of economically disadvantaged students is actually 21%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5020)|
| 1:23:49| So looking at that, knowing that they have said that there's a problem with the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| I went back to some other sections of the same data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| 2020 and 21, it's listed as less than 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| In 19 and 20, it's listed as 0%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| So still looking at an assumption that that data may be compromised, I went to the National Center for Education Statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| And there it lists things in numbers rather than as percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| And so if you look down, it says the free and reduced eligible direct certification is 61 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| That's 61 students of 296 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| And so it comes out to about that same 20-21 percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| So rather than looking at a low socioeconomic student ratio in the high 70s, we're actually looking at about 21%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5077)|
| 1:24:51| That's a huge difference in what's claimed in that application and what all of the source data tells us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| That seems pretty questionable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| So the numbers don't exactly line up, and I think we all got an email today that I'm not sure how that came to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| But it explained the differences, and we know also that it's a difference in the way state and federal counts those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| And they were concerned that we didn't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| But what we're actually seeing is that the state and federal numbers do line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| The numbers that don't line up are the numbers in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| If we go on to page 15, the chart on page 15 includes only five of our middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| It doesn't include all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| And we heard on Monday that they expected to draw from all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| Yet the data that they're looking at is only five of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| On page 12, citation 17, recruitment and outreach efforts will target families of students living and or attending schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| located within 12 miles of the proposed Knox Prep facility, with 2021-22 report card data showing one or more of the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5158)|
| 1:26:07| Previously in this same application, we were told that the target was to be Old North Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| which is not a low-income neighborhood, by the way, and Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| On this page, District 1 is added, as is a 12-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| However, in our Monday meeting, we were told that the school would be open to all boys in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| So all through the application, we have different targets that are being listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| and it seems very confusing about what that target actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| They also note that they will focus on students who are already taking advantage of our transfer policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| So students who are already transferring have the means to get to another school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5205)|
| 1:26:52| Generally, we know that students who are in a poverty situation don't have the means to get to another school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5212)|
| 1:27:01| So depending on targeting students who can already do that, that makes me wonder about who is actually the target audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5221)|
| 1:27:17| On page 19, citation 20, it says the average male out-of-school suspension rate across target schools, and it goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5237)|
| 1:27:26| But the data is not from Knox County schools. It's U.S. data. So it's not about target schools at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5246)|
| 1:27:38| From page 21, citation 22, from the application, it says few students currently exercise choice in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| and then it gives some census estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| But the source, which is not clickable, but it says MNPS 2021 October count data, that's Metro Nashville Public Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5269)|
| 1:27:58| So that's not looking at our students either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| When you get to page 23, there's a graphic that says that it's talking about the market share, K-12 charter market square of KCS students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5281)|
| 1:28:10| but in the center of that graphic, it says charter K-12 market share in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| So we have some mixed data. We have some data from the U.S. that says it's target schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| We have some data from Metro Nashville that says it's Knox County data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5303)|
| 1:28:32| There are a lot of numbers here that just don't match up with the actual students that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5312)|
| 1:28:41| Throughout the plan, Western Heights is mentioned, but the school isn't slated to be in Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| It's on the other side of the boundary created by I-275, which creates a natural difficulty for parents to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5326)|
| 1:28:54| The school is actually, we already said, slated to open between two higher income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| From the application data, it says 40% of adults in Western Heights have completed high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| If I click on the link that they supplied, and that link says 66% of residents have finished high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| that's a large discrepancy from their own data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| On page 25, Knox Prep seeks to serve a student population that is not currently being well served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5361)|
| 1:29:30| which also doesn't match the questions from Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| On page 26, this isn't necessarily a discrepancy, but it says we guarantee that all our prepsters will graduate high school and attend college or university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5373)|
| 1:29:45| Based on, I mean, how can you guarantee that? What is that guarantee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| On page 28, citation 32, it says Chattanooga spends 2.6% more per student, 8,841, than Knoxville, 8,615,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5390)|
| 1:30:01| but we know that that's very old data. That's not our per student ratio at all. Those are not our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5401)|
| 1:30:09| It's really concerning to me that a committee that's looking at this application, that a lot of these things didn't jump out at them as being inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5409)|
| 1:30:18| Our per student funding last year was around 10,000, and so those numbers should have jumped out very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5418)|
| 1:30:32| From page 31 and forward, I had to stop digging into this because there's some massive conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5432)|
| 1:30:42| It's charts of student schedules and all of these sample schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| The first one that you look at has zero electives in it, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| Then as you read down through there, it talks about electives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Then there's another chart. Then there's one that says how much RTI they're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| Basically, all of these schedules, they don't math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| There's no way that it works out to what they say they're going to have for students, the amount of time and the schedules, and none of the schedules match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5467)|
| 1:31:17| I don't even know how to resolve that. I looked at it for a very long time, and I just gave up on that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5477)|
| 1:31:25| I just have a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5485)|
| 1:31:34| On page 45, it lists a target area and says that 500 pieces of mail have been distributed via the targeted mail campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5494)|
| 1:31:42| including 239 postcards that were mailed to households with fourth graders living in the target area within zip codes 37921 and 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5502)|
| 1:31:56| 37921 is not a target area that they have discussed at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| If you would like to see the map of that area, I have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| It includes West Knoxville, West Haven, and goes on out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5527)|
| 1:32:15| On Monday, we asked about community meetings, and we were told that there had been many, many community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5535)|
| 1:32:23| I could look at that and say maybe that we are defining that term differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| but the list that we were sent that everyone should have is a list of individual people in the community that they met with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5549)|
| 1:32:39| There's one meeting on there that's listed as a community meeting, and it's only at the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| I don't know that general community members were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| That's why what we're hearing from the community is that they don't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| It's because the general community hasn't been contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| The general community has not been invited to share their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| We haven't talked to our community about whether they want this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| So, really, regardless of how we feel and our philosophy of charter schools and whether we think they are great or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5587)|
| 1:33:16| just on the face of the application, these discrepancies are something that should very seriously concern us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5596)|
| 1:33:27| The other thing that seriously concerns me is one of the emails and support that I got noted that this school outperforms all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5607)|
| 1:33:46| That's abjectly false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| If we look at our middle schools, and I really hadn't thought of this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| but when I went through and looked at all of the data for all of our middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| kudos to West Valley at 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| if we were to approve Knoxville Prep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| it would be our 16th middle school that has scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| because we have some that have such small numbers that they are not reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| And at number 16, it would be in the bottom quarter of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| So if we are bringing in a school that is supposed to be innovative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| that is supposed to lift our students up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| that is supposed to bring us something that is supposed to help all of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| which the charter law says is the purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| I don't understand why we are looking at a school that would be in the bottom quarter of all of our middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| That doesn't make sense to me. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| I must say that as I offered myself for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| we were asked about charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| And what I said was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| I'm against anything that takes away from the public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| And I realize that that is not a reason to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| So I had to force myself to have an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5729)|
| 1:35:36| I really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| And unfortunately, sometimes it's like a broken window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| that window just slides back down to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| But I had to force myself to have an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| And I also forced myself not to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| we don't have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| Because the way that the law is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| it seems as if we have to pass it or somebody else will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| And quite honestly, as a board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| I reject that because I have been given the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| of making the best decision for the students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| And that will greatly affect, and I believe in a negative way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| the number of people in the community I've talked to feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| But once again, that's still not a reason we can deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| We have to look at the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| The application has three areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| academic plan, operations plan, and financial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| And the applicant has to score a meet standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| in those three major areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| Now, past performance is only applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| if the applicant has one or more schools currently operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| which Chattanooga Prep does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| So that's what I'm understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| that as a board, we're responsible for looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| Looking at the academic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| and I've looked at grants and proposals and applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| in a number of different careers that the Lord allowed me to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| And one of those things happened is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| folk can make plans really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| But I tell you what, you never have a great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| you hardly ever have a great result without a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| So great plans are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| So the academic plan, the financial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| I've really looked at, quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| those are not my gifted areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| although I have been trained in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| But the operation plan is what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| And the reason why the operations plan concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| is because of the discrepancies that have been noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| Number four, student enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| We've heard about the economic disadvantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| discrepancy between Chattanooga Prep and the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| That is real. That's not made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| There is a discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| And I think that that discrepancy needs to be investigated and explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| Student discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Student discipline suspension rate reported, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| zero by CP, Chattanooga Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| And state data is 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| And we know, I believe, that charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| had an issue with suspensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| The first charter school we had had trouble with suspensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| when it initially started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| Suspensions are a challenge for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| So, student discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| And if you're reporting more than what you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| then, to me, you're going to have a problem with operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| Whenever your plan includes data that is not accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| then your operations are going to be more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| Third is community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| This is an area where I have to admit there is some subjection for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Because my name is on the list of people they talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| and they haven't talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| So I don't know about anybody else, but I know they didn't talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| But my name is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| And also, when you look at the way that it's listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| it gives the way I've read it, maybe not the way it was intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| but it basically says that these people we talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| and we gleaned something from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| or they gave us some kind of endorsement or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| They don't say that, but that's what it seems like it's presented as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| We're going to continue to do community engagement this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| And that's what I'm saying the operations plan comes up short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| Because if that's the way you're going to do it, you're going to come up short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| There are some organizations that's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| I think everybody has the same list that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| I found a list of emails when I came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| Did everybody get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| And these were organizations that they had on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| that seemingly they were endorsing them that are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| And there are some that's not listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| They haven't gotten that email, but they listed in their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| that it's not endorsing them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| They no longer have a relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| So the last thing I would say that in certain areas on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| particularly Title IX and another issue that Ms. Bight brought up about Title IX,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| is they say we're going to have them on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| That's not a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| Case-by-case, you've got to have a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| that you're going to handle each case by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| So I think that at best under the operations plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| is partially meet standard because they put it in a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| But the data, the information they put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| those kind of things does not support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| And then I think if you look at the discrepancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| and the things that Ms. Owens brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| that's the past performance, and that may be partially meet standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| If they're really at those scores that she's saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| that her research indicated, then that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| that they're partially meeting standard in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| So that does give us qualitative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| objective reasons to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| I am going to vote to deny and I'm going to encourage my colleagues to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| At best, this gives them 30 days to bring us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| some answers that will look straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| Also, I really don't like, I like for my, for our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| I'm sorry, I'm getting passionate now, so let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| I like for our attorney to tell us that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| and I think you did a good job being objective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| to tell us that, hey, these are issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| this is a problem area, this is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| So their attorney would do a better job of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| this is what we plan to do so we don't get sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| Because even though they may be the, I heard you say the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| usually when you use the primary, there can be a secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| Am I right about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| We may be the primary, but we may be the secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| And I don't want to go into something already anticipating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| I might be a secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| So for those reasons, I think we deny operations plan at best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| partially meet standards, past performance, partially meet standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| We have it objective, we have it qualitatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| so all we got to do is just vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| To not bend to the closed window of we got to vote it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| but make sure that we do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| and make them do what they have to do to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| I quickly came up with my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| Number one, false information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| Number five, lack of a real location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| I don't feel like being located at the Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| is a real long-term plan, and I would prefer to see something more concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| That's going to give me better feelings about the longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| of this school being in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| The next one, poor schedule planning and not a well-rounded plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| I think I really respect Superintendent Ryswick's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| 865 Academies and all that we are offering students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| We've seen how many Austin East students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| got full-ride scholarships to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| We are doing it, we just need to put more money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| My next is lack of community outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| I sent out thousands of mailers when I campaigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| so certainly you could do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| Lack of community input, lack of community approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| I have transgender students that I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| and transgender families, and I specifically asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| for them to commit to accept those students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| on how they identified, and there was no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| All the other responses were very prompt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| so I think that also tells me something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| On Monday, I was really disappointed to hear a young boy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| call his mother illiterate, because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| in certain communities that would not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| and that's really disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| Regardless of whether your mother can speak English| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| or read and write English or whatever language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| to get up in front of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| it's really disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| Lastly, this does not align with our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| I think doubling up on English and math doesn't align with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| We have a really well-rounded strategic plan to support students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| and it does not go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| Now I'm going to go into the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| and the false information and lack of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| I'm not mentioned here, but apparently Reverend Butler is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| so that's real interesting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| I also reached out to several community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| Allison Comer, the Executive Director of Muse Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| where she refutes endorsing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| and also some of their listings in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| and also has never agreed to have a partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| with them, but she says that they just asked a lot of clarifying questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| Next, one of my constituents reached out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| and she discussed Emerald Academy's lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| a very distinct plan to serve special ed students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| and students with those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| The Knox County teacher letter that you heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| Breonna Holloway's letter that you heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| she's a parent, she's a community member, and a community leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Charles Lomax, he specifically, there's a letter there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| and I'm happy to share any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| I reached out to the bottom, which it was really interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| that when Anchorman PR reached out to me, they had no idea what the bottom was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| And I think for anyone that is in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| you know what the bottom is and what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| So I reached out to him and he's the Executive Director of the Change Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| and it did not take me very long, essentially this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| to get all of this stuff together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| If it only takes me a week, imagine if you did some real community outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| what you could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| Thank you, Madam Chair. First, I appreciate the robust conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| and one of my concerns even going into this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| before we even opened up the discussion, I mean months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| when we knew this was coming, is I really didn't want this to become a policy debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| because it's really not what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| It's not what we've been charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| That policy's been decided at a state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| and regardless of whether or not any of us like it or not, it's been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| And what we're here for tonight is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| And I appreciate that each board member who's been engaging in these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| I feel like has done, is doing their due diligence the way that they know how to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| and the way that kind of fits the way that they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| I'm actually on the other end of the spectrum, I think, than Reverend Butler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| in that I don't have a policy issue with charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| I actually see them different than vouchers and some other things that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| for our charter school and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| And when I went into this process months ago, at least probably around August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| is when I started engaging in this process as I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| about the potentiality of Knox Prep coming into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| There was really kind of three things that kind of drove my process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| One is, can they do the things that they say they're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| in the way they say they're going to do them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| If they can't do anything, we've got to make sure that they can do it in the way they say they're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| The other thing that I've been looking at is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| does the community in which they want to serve actually want them there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| Because although our Charter Review Committee is charged with reviewing the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| they're not charged with asking these other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| It's not in their purview. It's not what they're being asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| But to Reverend Butler's point, as an elected body who's representing a constituency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| we are charged to do that, whether it's this issue or any other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| We're charged to hash those things out and try to come to some understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| And honestly, until today, I did not know how I was going to vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| And I do appreciate Knox Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| and they've been very open in their dialogue with me in terms of being responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| I do have some concerns and some challenges related to the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| and I don't necessarily fault Knox Prep for all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| I don't know that the application, the way it's designed, is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| For instance, one of the things that it talks about is community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| Well actually, what I want to know is community support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| which to me is different than community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Community engagement is I'm just reaching out to folks in a given community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| That doesn't mean I really have anybody's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| And to me, activity in a community does not speak to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| And coming from a participatory community development philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| and the work that I do, I fundamentally believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| that good solutions cannot be given in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| unless the community is involved in developing the solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| You've seen that play out all throughout history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| that those who are coming from outside of a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| cannot come up with the best solution for a community itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| Because solutions have to be contextualized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| It's just the nature of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| And so I know some of my other board members have already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| I've brought up lots of different concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| Some of those I share to different degrees than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| But the one concern that's not been lifted up that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| that I want to make known, is that what I've seen in my investigations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| and my going out into the community and talking to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| is actually not a lack of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| It's actually a retraction of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| I've seen a number of folks who were very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| about Knox Prep in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| And what I've seen, and it's not for me to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| who those folks are tonight, and it's not for me to give their reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| But what I've seen is that through their engagements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| which is way more engagement than I've ever had with the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| and I've engaged the school a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| is that they've actually lost support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| And I'm not going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| It's not my place to say why that is or why it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| But no matter how this vote goes down tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| Knox Prep, what I want you to hear is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| I fundamentally believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| I believe over the last 18 months that you've been in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| you've actually lost support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| And I don't know what you want to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| I don't know if that conjures up anything to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| I don't know if you feel like there's any credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| in that statement or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| But that's what I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| And so, to me, that's a big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| Because regardless, again, of how we go about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| how we feel about the policy of charter schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| if it's good for a community and all those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| that's not what I'm here to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| What I'm here to debate is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| is this something that a community wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| on top of all the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| that my other board members have mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| So, to me, that is disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| Because a school like this that's not a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| of the centralized public school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| no matter how much it may want to be or may not to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| I don't think can do good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| in the community without that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| And so, for that reason, I will be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| I just have one question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| If, and that's a big if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| particularly tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| this were to be approved by five or more votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| then it gets up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| And over the course of two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6831)|
| 1:53:58| it is failing as far as the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6838)|
| 1:54:05| and everything that it needs to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| Then do we as a board have a way to dissolve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6850)|
| 1:54:19| So, I mean, the general answer would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| Specifics would depend upon the charter agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| between this board and the board for the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| You could look to the agreement that already exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| with the one charter school in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| to look at that example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| But, I mean, it has to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| they're evaluated every so often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| without getting into the deep weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| And there would be standards that would have to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| And usually, again, they're agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| But there would be a way if they weren't meeting those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| All right. I just have a, I guess a couple of quick questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6913)|
| 1:55:21| or comments more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| So, I have the state report card for Central High School pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6923)|
| 1:55:33| And it is saying that that school is 26% economically disadvantaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6933)|
| 1:55:41| I would disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| And the only reason, I mean, when you go into the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| it seems like, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| I would think that they could possibly qualify as a Title I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| I mean, but they have a lot of undocumented students in that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6955)|
| 1:56:02| And those are not reflected on your state and federal reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| And those are not reflected on your state and federal report cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| So, I would just like to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| Yes, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| Thank you for allowing me to have a little open dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| But the school in question does not have undocumented folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| But, well, my point is that based on what I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6988)|
| 1:56:35| if your reasoning being that Chattanooga Prep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| if your evidence that Chattanooga Prep misrepresented themselves in this category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7001)|
| 1:56:49| that might not necessarily be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| Because this category does not account for some student populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| Because it's based on those who apply for benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| If you allow me, once again, some open dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| If you were applying for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| if you make an application and that data was not consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| then we need to have some research to indicate where you're getting your figures from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7034)|
| 1:57:21| Right now, I think you've done the eye test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| And I won't disagree with you on the eye test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| I've done my own eye test at times and felt like I was accurate and was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| Sometime I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| One of the things that my shop teacher said was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| if you measure with a ruler, you know you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| And I think that we just need to find a ruler and measure it so we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| Because if that's wrong, then if I'm going to do an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| I want to get the state to make sure I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| Well, I'm just coming from the perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| if we're saying that someone misrepresented themselves based on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| that there could be possible explanations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| And I'm agreeing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| What I'm saying is, can we deny them tonight and have them give us the explanations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| And give us the explanations in writing because that's what the application was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| Can we please have order in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| I hear some voices and I'm having a hard time hearing Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| So, that and I guess going to the community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| You know, if people don't want their kids at this school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| they're not going to apply for this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| But that being said, that's really all I have to add tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| Ms. Henderson, you have not had an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| Mr. Scott, would you mind coming up and just addressing some of these issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Point of order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| I thought we were at a point of discussion with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| I didn't know we were bringing more witnesses up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Well, I think he can clarify some of these false numbers and add some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7151)|
| 1:59:18| But we have to put our responses, our resolution in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| So, I think whatever we get will be in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| But I object to him coming up at this time, but I don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| Well, I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| He might override me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| I would say that if we are going to have to vote on reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| that we might have board members that would like to ask additional questions for clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7176)|
| 1:59:46| Do we need to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| Whether he can speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| I've never...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| And we're having a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Well, yeah. I mean, right now...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| We were at a discussion last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| Right now it's a board discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| I think since you have an objection at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| it might be good to have a motion and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| No, I'm just saying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| I think it's good to have all of the information out there and the clear information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| I'll make a motion. Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| I make a motion for Mr. Scott to speak and address the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| So, we have a motion by Ms. Henderson to allow Mr. Scott to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| A second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| Ms. Coatney, will you do a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Ms. Holm... I'm sorry. Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| That's five yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| Okay, so motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| So, Ms. Henderson, you can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| Yes, do you mind clarifying some of the discussion that's going on here, Mr. Scott, with the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| Absolutely. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| I know there was an email sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair, Madam Chair, the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak on behalf of Knoxville PREP, our proposed application to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| I know you're tasked with a very difficult task, and I know the community, there's concerns, but there's also support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7277)|
| 2:01:26| As we have engaged in the community throughout this process, our parental and student and community support has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7286)|
| 2:01:36| In terms of the data that's been questioned, we stand behind our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| We stand behind, for example, our state report card that's not accurately represented because of certain populations within our school that is not represented in that data because they don't have the documents to show up in that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7300)|
| 2:01:56| Hamilton County Schools sent an email out to you all today, vouching for our data, standing behind it, stating there were discrepancies amongst the reporting with charter schools and Hamilton County Schools going to the state this past year and years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7316)|
| 2:02:15| So we stand behind our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| We stand where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| We stand by our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| We stand by the parents that want voice, that want choice in their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| That's all we're trying to do is provide a high-quality choice for parents, and ultimately, parents have the vote whether to send their child to our school or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7348)|
| 2:02:38| So in terms of our academic data, our economic disadvantage data, the community members we've met with, and I will clarify Reverend Butler, all that list is touch points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7358)|
| 2:02:50| I did call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| I did email you several times to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| Members of our team have reached out to you to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| Ms. Byke, you were listed in the charter app as meeting with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| Just because an organization is on there or a person is on there doesn't mean they've endorsed us, and I'm sorry if it was presented that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7384)|
| 2:03:13| Part of the rubric and part of the application is to state and log what touch points we've made with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| We've listened to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| Our support has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| Our letters of intent on our website from parents, parents from each of your districts who have said if Knoxville Prep is approved, I will send my child to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7402)|
| 2:03:35| That has grown from zero letters of intent to 75 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| Some parents who are in the audience tonight here that want this choice for their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7419)|
| 2:03:47| Ultimately, parents have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| I can tell you if you approve us tonight, you don't approve us, but if you do, our commitment is to serve children and give parents of Knoxville a choice in their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7430)|
| 2:04:01| Our results are proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| The example is at Chattanooga Prep, the students that are here on their spring break that are not being forced to be here because they want to advocate for the work they are doing and their families have chose for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7444)|
| 2:04:15| That's what we want to do in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| I know there's questions, but trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| See our example in Chattanooga and see the parents, the parents that want a high quality choice for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7460)|
| 2:04:27| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| Just hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| You may want to speak to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| There is a quote in the Knox News Sentinel that says Chattanooga Prep outscored all Knox County middle schools and placed far above the average scores for the schools located in zones it expects to draw students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7473)|
| 2:04:45| Do you want to speak to that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| Yes, I think there was clarification to that point in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| It's compared to middle schools that serve students with similar backgrounds and similar demographics as us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| If you look at the state report card, if you look and compare our data to middle schools in Knox County, Hamilton County that serve similar demographics, students with background as Chattanooga Prep, you'll see that we're outperforming those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7498)|
| 2:05:13| And I will add that if approved, our results are your results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| The test that our students take will say Knox County schools on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| So when our students are represented in the audience today, when they're doing exceptional in their math, science, social studies courses, they are part of your strategic plan because their data is your data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7521)|
| 2:05:33| And I will reiterate, we want to be a tool in the toolbox and ultimately parents will be the decision making force in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| That's all the questions I have for Mr. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| Ms. Feig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| I understand that I was listed in your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| Why wasn't I listed in this log?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| As indicated in the log that I sent you, it was a very rough draft and I did indicate that there were more community contacts that were not listed in that rough draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7556)|
| 2:06:06| But in the official application you are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| You had asked for any other logs that we had and you received the rough draft back office points of contact that we made in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7569)|
| 2:06:18| I can tell you I've been up at least weekly, met with a lot of you, reached out to every single one of you to meet and hear feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7578)|
| 2:06:25| Any responses you've asked, I've responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| And parents ultimately, those 75 parents that have signed letters of intent, they want a high quality choice for their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7588)|
| 2:06:35| Why can they not decide for their child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| Yeah, I heard you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| It seems like though there are some things that are kind of cut off in this log and they're a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| Who made this log?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| Did you make this log?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| Did you make this log?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| Members of our team added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| We had a Google doc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| Can you name who added to this Google doc?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| For HR purposes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| A member of our team, various members of our team added to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| So I see that it has like possible partnership with MUSE and I have the letter from the MUSE that says that they did not discuss a possible partnership and that they refute this documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7625)|
| 2:07:14| So I'm just really confused about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| Why things would be listed here and that maybe someone in your team doesn't have accurate information or you're trying to give inaccurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7639)|
| 2:07:28| Yes, I apologize if anything seems inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| I will stand behind you ask for a raw documentation of our community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| I don't think I said raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| Back off this indication and members of our team did have communication with the Knoxville News and the keyword there is possible collaboration just like we want to have collaboration with any Knox County organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7657)|
| 2:07:52| So why didn't you reach out to the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| The bottom is actually a bookstore in East Knoxville that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| We have been by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| We've heard all about it from members of our advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| Our proposed principal is excited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| And talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| Do you have their support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| Do you know what kind of work they do in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7692)|
| 2:08:13| I know they my understanding is they have an excellent shop that engages the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| They're very aware of the community and if approved our proposed leadership team including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| Will you know what kind of workshops they put on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| But would be excited to go and learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| That's something I wish that you had done already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| And I'm really curious about what you think about how this aligns with our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| And feedback will take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| And I will say if approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| It's going to require us to be in the community even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| Because again, ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| I asked about the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| The strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| One of the big pieces is the 75 percent of college going students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| That gap is roughly around 400 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| And so our college going plan with our young men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| If you look at the college going rates of men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| Do you know what our strategic plan is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| Well, can we let him finish answering that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| He's not answering my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| Well, he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| But he's not finished his sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| Let him finish his sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| Edmund, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| Yes, Mr. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| So the college preparatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| Advancing kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| Giving no limits to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| For young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| For parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| For their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| That prepares them to be the citizens tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| The overlapping of the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| Our college base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Our AP classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| Our ACT classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| When parents decide if they choose to send their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| Just like Chattanooga Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| We're going to prepare them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| How many county schools will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| And there's letters in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| From Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| Where we are a tool in the tool box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| For the strategic plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| No limits when it comes to their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| And if approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| Our leadership team is prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| To sit down with the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| And the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| Learn more about the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| And how we can be a tool in that tool box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| To help support young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Because ultimately again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| Our students are still Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Their test scores are your test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| So just like we're doing at Chattanooga Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| We want to excel them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| And ensure that they're the leaders of tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| So I know that you've been doing this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| Since retiring in January of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| And I'm really surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| That you couldn't tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| What our strategic plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| I think that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| I'm not going to get into the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| An argument or a debate with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| But I can say that we're very aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Of the achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| And building future career ready graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| The Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| What I heard at the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| College going forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| I've been hearing from parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| Social studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| Reading scores need to accelerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| And we want to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| I think we can all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| That the strategic plan of all of our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Public education entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| To send kids to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Prepare them for careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| And prepare them to be future ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| Through academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| And that's what we're prepared to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| That's what we're doing in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| Could you talk to us a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| About how your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| Learning opportunities will be accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| To female students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| I'm not in a position to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| Because our mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| For Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| Is to provide excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| And accessible learning opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| That empower all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| To realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| And so I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| To how you plan to ensure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| There's a public charter school in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| That is following the law of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| We can have a single gender model school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| And I can assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| With the young men that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| We will provide equal access for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| Of a high quality education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| Just as we've proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| At Chattanooga Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| For the families that are choosing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| Every young man sitting behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| Is representative of a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| And I understand that it's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| In Tennessee to have a single sex school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| But we also have federal requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| And we also have our own mission and vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| That we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| Very carefully crafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| And our mission that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| Very carefully crafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| That is part of our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| Is to provide excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| And accessible learning opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| That empower all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| To realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| So while it may be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| There are lots of things that are legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| But that doesn't necessarily make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| For the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| And that's why we're trying to ask these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| Is to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| How it is that you believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| What you're doing fits into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| I have a point of order for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7992)|
| 2:13:15| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| In these charter laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| And charter applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| Not non-prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Is of course a non-boy school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| Are they required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| Adhere to the strategic plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| Of a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| Is that something that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| That is written into this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8013)|
| 2:13:40| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8022)|

| 2:13:56| The LEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| I don't know of anything in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| That says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| Specifically what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| Which is that they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| Adhere to the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8048)|

| 2:14:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| I'm talking about the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Our speaker brought up the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| What I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| Is whether this is a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| For Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| And since we have a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| That specifically speaks to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| Whether you like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| That's what we're speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| Since you have brought up the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| If we want to look at the Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| Public Charter Schools Act of 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8077)|

| 2:14:41| Of the Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| Public Charter Schools Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| Number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| The purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| Is improve learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| For all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| And I can't find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| That this improves learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| For our female students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| So if we are going to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| Learning for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| I need to be able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| How this improves learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| For our female students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| Number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| Is to encourage the use of different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| And innovative teaching methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8117)|
| 2:15:23| A single sex school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| Is not a method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| And so the only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| The only innovative teaching method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| That I have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| Is finding joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| And while I'm all about joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| We know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| Hey don't laugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| I'll go a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| That's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| That's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| Instilling joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| Isn't enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| For me to turn over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| 700 of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| To someone who hasn't shown me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| That they have the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| To do what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| They're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| Whether we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| Whether we are pro or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| Or opposed to charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| What we have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| Is an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| That.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8175)|
| 2:16:22| Frankly the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| Cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| I don't think meets the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| For most of our high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| English classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| That's something we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| Seriously look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| That's why I pulled out all those citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| Because when I'm looking through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| The citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| Are not adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| And if that's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| We're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| I mean if that's what we're looking at in an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| That took months and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| To come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| Then that's something we should be questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| As Reverend Butler pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| We're not talking about the philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| Of charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| We're supposed to be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| The application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| And if we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| If we can't look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| In a concrete way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| And look at the facts of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| The citations that we're given in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| I didn't make those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| Those are the citations they gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| I'm not choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| With the exception of comparing to the federal data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| Because we did get something from the charter center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| That pointed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| So I didn't choose the citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| I didn't go look these things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| These are not studies that I've gone out and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| I'm looking at the citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| They gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| This is what they gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| That's all I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| Is what they gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| We shouldn't be looking at anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| I can go out and look at one of my schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| And say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| Maybe that doesn't look right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| But when I'm presenting something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| That is supposed to be factual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| And I'm giving a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| That is supposed to prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| That would be on the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| Doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| That would be on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| If I were submitting an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| To give that accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| And to cite it accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| We've not heard from you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| Just kind of in response to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| Spike said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| Related to one of the students that is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| Were those students given a script.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| Before they spoke up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| No sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| They spoke from their hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| And I have a question for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| Is it our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| It's our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| That if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| Students choose not to attend the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| They will get no money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| It's based on students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| You're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| So if we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| Let's say we approved it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| Or we don't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| It goes through some process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| And ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Gets approved by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8349)|

| 2:20:01| It will benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8401)|

| 2:20:16| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8416)|

| 2:23:18| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| Really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| What I'm saying is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| Let's look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| The application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| The application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8605)|
| 2:23:26| Comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| Short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| It has discrepancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| We know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| We can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| And see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Quantitative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| It's measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| It fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| Into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| The academic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8617)|
| 2:23:38| Operation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| It falls into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8623)|

| 2:23:53| So I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| That.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| And that's why I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| Hanan objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| Because at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| This point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| We done all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Our research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| We heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| About.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| No it's time to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| What.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| Does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| The application say, so what you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| This just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| Application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| Standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| And this point it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| Does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| And when we do we want to application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| Is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| Is approved or not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| This is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| Then it's gonna be a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| Charter agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| to do what's on the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| They don't do what they stand up and talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| They write about it, got to be done what's on the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| So that's all I'm saying is let's not change the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8668)|
| 2:24:29| I was told we had to look, it wasn't about how we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| about it, it's what does it say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| And I think we see clearly that there are discrepancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| that what was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| And I'm not the only one who read those names down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| and felt like these were people that they talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| or these people that, I know they didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| everybody they talked to didn't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| because we had some staff persons who couldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| that wasn't their role to agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| that was their role to provide information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| The organizations that they said that had agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| now they either agreed when they put it on the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| or they even backed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| But this, what I'm reading here said they never agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| So that is a problem with the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| So that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| I can't tell anybody how to vote because it's your vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| but I'm saying that we see clearly there's a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| with the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| Let's call it what it is, let's vote, they go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| and for whatever way they can change it, get it fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| come back, we look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| But I was told we had to look at the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| that's what we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| I did hear one thing though this week that I didn't think was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8734)|
| 2:25:39| it was not from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| And that was Mr. Watson talked about the white saviorism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8741)|
| 2:25:55| I understand that perspective from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| From our perspective is the white takeover process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| and this is affecting our school, schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8762)|
| 2:26:08| So, and I know in District 1, but in the neighboring districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| we already got one, here comes another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| here comes another one, and here comes another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| And I know that it's because we have some tough challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8782)|
| 2:26:29| in our schools and they look vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| If you had tough challenges in your school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| and I know you have challenges, but if you had tough challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| in your community, maybe they, and you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| and your schools look vulnerable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| maybe they would come and attack yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| Or the ones that, because yours are mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| so the ones in your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| But at this point, if they're going to come and run a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8807)|
| 2:26:52| let them do what we got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| Let them file an application that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| Because if they file an application that's not accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| and it goes through, then the data that we report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| the data they report to us, we report to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| It's the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| It's something that they're going to write to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| And how much effort do we have to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| in to make sure they're writing it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| So I'm going to stop talking because I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| like now I've gone past the point of objectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Mr. Dupler, if their application has what we would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8844)|
| 2:27:30| to be deficiencies and we deny based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| on those deficiencies, they have 30 days to correct them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8854)|
| 2:27:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| Or they can choose to go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| Am I right on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| If the board denies and provides the written objective reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8867)|
| 2:27:55| and one of those reasons is discrepancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| in the application, then yes, they would have 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| to amend their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| So all they would have to do is correct these discrepancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| and bring it back, just like redoing their homework, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| I mean, they would have the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| to amend in whatever way they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| We already have that motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| We have a motion for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| Is the motion on the floor to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8907)|
| 2:28:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| We have a motion to approve by Mr. Triplett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8912)|
| 2:28:37| I don't think there's any more discussion, so Ms. Coatney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8917)|
| 2:28:43| will you do a reverse roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8923)|
| 2:28:49| Can we have the question read again just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| to make sure I'm not confused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| The motion was to approve the charter application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| It was to approve the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| of the Charter School Application Review Team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| and it was seconded by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| And Madam Chair, would you like for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| to go with you first or last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8947)|
| 2:29:12| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8952)|
| 2:29:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8953)|
| 2:29:13| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| Dr. Boehler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| That's four yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| OK, so that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| So now we will begin our resolution for reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| and we will have to take a vote on each of those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8974)|
| 2:29:43| A tie vote's a fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| You have to have five votes to approve anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| so four four ties a fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8991)|
| 2:29:55| All right, so before we, what time is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| Does anybody need a break before we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| All right, so before we continue this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| can we board members take a 10-minute recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| and come back to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9008)|
| 2:30:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9011)|
| 2:30:18| All right, we will be resolving for reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| All right, we will be resuming our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9021)|
| 2:30:51| All right, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9051)|
| 2:31:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| I'd like to make a motion to delegate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| the writing and the composition of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9071)|
