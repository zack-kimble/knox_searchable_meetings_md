| 0:16:36| money. Years ago, it got 501c3 status. The language you just read is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=996)|

| 0:16:45| status. I didn't draft the original charter, but it retains its 501c3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| status. It's filed 990s, but it does not make charitable contributions. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| basically has served as, as you all probably know, as the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1016)|

| 0:17:04| many, many years. All of that property, essentially all of its assets are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| moved, and all of its assets are essentially properties that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| paid for through contributions, such as Midway. They don't own a single piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1035)|

| 0:17:41| this particular entity will have essentially no remaining assets. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| will go to either the Industrial Development Board or the Chamber, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1065)|

| 0:17:56| originally got their 501c3 status. If your question is, have they been making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| charitable contributions, the answer is no. They've really just been serving as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| an economic development arm of the city and the county. And, but would this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1084)|

| 0:18:28| theoretically, if they had assets, they could do that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1108)|

| 0:19:45| approve and seconded. Council Member Parker. Thank you, Mayor. This item has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| come before us on first, I guess, and second reading. I honestly don't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| the second reading, but on first reading I raised concerns because when I read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1198)|
| 0:20:08| through the plan for services that we are required by state law to submit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1208)|
| 0:20:19| the state when there's an annexation, when I read through the plan of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| it did not seem to justify the annexation, or in other words, the revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1225)|
| 0:20:35| that might come to the city through this annexation would not cover the plan of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| service that we developed. And so I just wanted to ask a couple of questions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| clarification to our, to the chief, KPD chief. Under this plan of service, it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1246)|
| 0:20:59| this area, and this is a item 11D, the apartment annexation over off Alcoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1259)|
| 0:21:09| this area will be Beat 71. Does Beat 71 currently exist? Yes, it does. Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1269)|
| 0:21:20| The other question that I had are, are there any, is there any anticipation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1280)|
| 0:21:32| we would need to increase resources for our various departments in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1292)|
| 0:21:43| fulfill this plan of service? Say that again? Would increasing resources to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1303)|
| 0:21:53| current departments be required in order to fulfill this plan of service? My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| understanding is no, and Mr. Brace is confirming. I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| that, because when we had this conversation before, the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| was asked how much in property taxes would come from this annexation, and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| guess was $700,000. And that seemed like an unrealistic number to me, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| appreciate getting the actual numbers, which currently on that property, without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1343)|
| 0:22:32| improvements to the property, it's around $4,000 per year in property taxes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| we get. And I did the calculations. If the improvements increase the value of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| property to $10 million, we're still under $50,000 in annual property taxes. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| just want us to be thoughtful as a city. I know oftentimes these are strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| that are pursued and discussed as a way to increase revenue, but if it increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| expenses and our responsibilities and the services that we're providing to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| degree that outweighs the additional property taxes, I think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| that we have to consider. And so I'm glad to hear that we already have Police Beat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| 71, because even if that property is $10 million, that additional $50,000 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| property taxes will not cover even one police officer and cruise car. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| how I read it. Ms. Parker, I think Mr. Emmett, who is our annexation guru, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| maybe shed a little light on this. Mr. Emmett, could you speak to some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| concerns? Yeah, thank you, Mayor. Rick Emmett, downtown coordinator and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| sometimes annexation guy for the city, I suppose. Yeah, on the revenue side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| the important thing to remember is it's $50,000 a year forever. I mean, so, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| know, it's a boon for the city. On top of that, there's 500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| residents going to be in this unit, this apartment. That's $161 in state shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| taxes we get back every year. So that's $80,000 there. It's a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| significant amount, and again, that's forever. So as long as it's in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| as long as we exist. So I think that's the way we usually look at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| It's not a one-time, you know, $50,000. So even if we have to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| somebody, they're on the payroll for that one time, but we keep on going. So, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| these things are pretty significant revenue generators for us, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| typically don't spend much on the services. We're already providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| services out there. Like I said, we're already out there doing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| on that very property today. So I don't expect us to do much more commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| property. You know, we don't pick up garbage there, for instance. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| really an emergency services or possibly some engineering. We make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| called out there for some drainage issue or something. So there's not a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| services that we have to provide there, typically, particularly for new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| developments. So I just thought that might be good for you all to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| part. The state shared taxes is important. $161 a person. That's why our census was so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| important, and I know a lot of folks here helped us with that, you know, just a year or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| two ago. I was just at a seminar in Gatlinburg recently, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| came up. $161 per person for the census, and that's a that's a firm number. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| we get more than that, but that's state shared taxes we get back. So just thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| y'all would want to know that. Thank you. Thank you. Just a further point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| clarification. This is not, this is a voluntary, they're seeking to join the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| city. We didn't recruit them. They want to be part of the city because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| services we provide. I heard something different from the developer. It seemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| like their preference was to have their full property in the county, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| wasn't an option for them, and that's okay. My point with this conversation was just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| clarify a few details for my purposes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| Uh-huh. Ms. Fugate. Thank you. Along that line, I think a lot of what I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| to say may have been answered, but my understanding was this property abuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| city property where this entire development is going to be built. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| rather than have a county portion and a city portion, since by law he could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| de-annex his city property into the county, the only option to have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| government to deal with would be us. And also, if there's a problem, fire, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1590)|
| 0:26:39| on a piece of property that is part in the city and part in the county, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| going anyway. Am I correct? I think there's some, we collaborate with our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Yeah, I mean, if a building catches on fire and half of it's in the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| half of it's in the county, the city people are going to respond. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| that would be why he made his request to just deal with one. On the border, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| always get called. Both agencies always get called, police and fire, both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| because the GI's folks are not, they want to make sure we get the services out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| there like we need to get them out there. So we're not going to even question it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| We're going to dispatch everybody out there and let, let's figure out whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| jurisdiction when we get there is typically what happens. And our guys are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| good. We're usually there first, so. Thank you. I just, that was what I heard at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| last meeting as well, was that this is why he wanted to be annexed into the city. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1646)|

| 0:28:03| seconded. Councilmember Parker. This is another agenda item that I had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| concerns with, and largely my concern is when we are giving significant funds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1690)|
| 0:28:19| a third-party entity and over multiple years and not provided progress report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1699)|
| 0:28:28| I did reach out and receive some information, a few updates of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| activities that the Chamber has been engaging in, but especially when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1715)|
| 0:28:44| to minority-owned businesses, I view the city's responsibility differently, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1724)|
| 0:28:53| view it as a legal responsibility for the city to address disparities, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| uncomfortable with how the city has chosen to support minority contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| through the Chamber of Commerce and through the Entrepreneur Center when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| do not have oversight, we're not getting reports on how those funds are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| spent, who those funds are going to, whether it's addressing disparity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| issues, whether we're seeing increased revenue amongst those businesses, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| that's one of my concerns. It seems like a lot of the work that the Chamber is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| doing is really good work and worth the city's support, but just in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| our support of minority contractors, I would like for us to take the path of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1780)|
| 0:29:50| legal obligation rather than tossing a few coins over to the Chamber to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| what they can do. I need reports, I need to understand how these dollars are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| impacting these vulnerable communities. That's my concern. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| Mr. Fugate, did you have your light on? No? Okay. I just want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1810)|
| 0:30:18| that Mike Odom, head of the Chamber, is here, if council members want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| from him. Vice Mayor Roberto? You were moving in the direction I was. Okay. Mr. Odom, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| want to come down? You know, I know you've come and discussed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Chamber's Path to Prosperity strategic vision with council before, but you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| this is a great opportunity for you to refresh not only council's recollection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| on it, but also anyone who's watching or here with us this evening. So if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| would, maybe review that with us. Absolutely. Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| 17 Market Square, number 201. Mayor, good evening. Council, good evening. Path to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| Prosperity is our five-year strategic vision, which it helps us to fulfill our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| mission of driving a regional economic prosperity. It is focused on what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| the economic ecosystem, which is designed to really deliver on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| services and support for business expansion, business attraction, business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| climate, entrepreneurship, small business, infrastructure, and talent. Those are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| six areas we kind of focus on. The main priorities of Path to Prosperity are to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| develop and implement a regional workforce development strategy, develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| and implement a regional talent retention attraction strategy, and focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| on that business expansion over business attraction component, develop and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| implement a regional access to capital strategy. I should know these. I say them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| all the time. Develop a community brand. I think that's six that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| All of those have been developed. We're in the implementation stage of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| right now, and when we came to you all back in the budgeting process, we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| about, so the mission, the vision, and the plan is the annual business plan that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| do. This year, we're focused on a couple few things. One is about growth, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| have to, as a community, continue to grow and grow in the right way so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| can continue to drive revenue so that the services that the city provides have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| the funding to do so. Two, we work a lot on access to capital this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| Councilmember Parker mentioned about our minority businesses. If you remember, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| think it was a year ago, year and a half ago, Councilmember McKenzie asked us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| really make an effort to go out to talk to African-American businesses who may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| not realize that you can interact with the chamber without actually being what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| we call an investor or a member, just because as a business, we're here to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| you. That led to about 78, almost 80, I think it was 78 different conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| with business owners. Charles is giving me a head, it's not a yes, so I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| that, and what we've been doing since then is following back up with them. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| two number, number one issue, the two issues that came out from that, one, were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| customers. Like most small businesses, they need new customers, and two, was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| access to capital. And so we've really been focusing over the last 12 months on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| how we fulfill that need of that really in that micro loan or micro funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| piece, that $5,000 to $50,000. And we think we have a great partnership with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| organization, a statewide CDFI called Pathway Lending. They are actually based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| in our building here, and we think that's really going to start to be addressed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| an aggressive way. And then the final one is really digital literacy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| access. As you all know, during the height of the pandemic, we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| focused on getting internet access to the people who need it most. KEB is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| going to fill a void from there, which is tremendous, but we also make to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| sure that the folks have the tools that they need and then the literacy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| So we have led an initiative called the ENOX 2.0 Digital Literacy Initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| which is where people for very low cost can buy or use a Chromebook, a Google| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| Chromebook, and they will have training over a six-week period to learn how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| use that properly. So that initiative is a partnership with us, KUB, and an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| organization called Heartland Forward. And so that's been a lot of our work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| that front. All this falls within the big Path to Prosperity's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| vision. One last piece is on the real true economic development efforts. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| really, from the attraction standpoint, tried to be much more targeted on how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| do it. Again, looking to try to, a big push for us is to raise average annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| pay of our citizenry. And to do that, we need to make sure we have the companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| that come in and be able to do that and offer the jobs that we need of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| constituents. Did I answer your question, Vice Mayor? Thank you. Yeah, I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| say one other thing. Council Member Parker, you bring up a great point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| about understanding what we're doing. So to get into the nuts and bolts, for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| for you all, when you all pay us, you pay us on a quarterly basis, we submit a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| tracking system of what we've done over the last three months. So you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| exactly what we're doing each of those three months. We do that four times a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| year, obviously. You mentioned, I'm not, we really haven't looked at the revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| that that generates for the city, but I'm sure it could be done if we spend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| little time and look at it. That is what I'm most interested in. I'm glad that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| all are keeping busy, but I would like to see results. Absolutely. We're all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2140)|

| 0:41:07| Thank you, Mayor. I was wondering if Mr. Bentley would come up and give us a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| better understanding of this agreement and particularly I'm curious about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2474)|
| 0:41:24| Bell Street to LP and associate entities and how that setup works. Yeah, so how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| long do you have? Yes, I can try to unpack that in a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| simple way for everybody. So anytime we're using tax credits to finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| something, we, KCDC, or anybody else that's building affordable housing, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| have to bring on a private entity that can utilize the tax credits. As a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| governmental entity, we just don't have the ability to use federal tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| We bring them into a partnership. There's a limited partnership agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| which really governs, you know, there's a 15-year period where this agreement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| going to be in place. KCDC will manage the property over that time period. At| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| the end of the 15-year agreement, the partnership unwinds. The asset is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| hundred percent owned by KCDC at that point, but the partnership for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| utilization of the tax credits has to exist over what they call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| affordability period in the world of tax credits. Does that make sense? Now, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| is this? Did I read this wrong? I thought the Bell Street to LP was established by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| KCDC. It is. It is established by KCDC and it's an entity that's actually, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| the limited partnership has us as one. We're the general partner in that legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| structure. There's also, in most cases, a special limited partner for the purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| of utilization of the tax credits. That special limited partner in this case is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| Pinnacle Bank, but it could be a large financial institution or, you know, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| large corporation. Interesting. Okay. My only other question was perhaps for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2577)|
| 0:43:07| housing, but curious why we're not using money in the affordable housing fund set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2587)|
| 0:43:16| aside for permanent supportive housing rather than the affordable rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| development fund for this project? Ms. Gill? I think I can speak to that. So, by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| ordinance, we committed for five years to fund at least 1.5 million dollars of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| funding toward affordable housing. It did not specify the source from which that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| came. These 1.5 million dollars were actually allocated in year one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| the affordable housing fund, which was last fiscal year, and so we're utilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| them, but they've been, quote-unquote, put in the bank for this purpose as of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| year. Thank you. Councilmember McKenzie? Thank you, Mayor. I just want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2630)|

| 0:44:11| health care, meal, transportation, and other services, and that there will also be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| telehealth space, also a congregate meal area, and so I was really pleased to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| that they'll have some additional assistance on-site at their disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2661)|

| 0:45:33| know, some of you know that the Design Center is now 52 years old, and during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| that time, in the last 52 years, the Design Center has done over 1,200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| projects for not only the city, but the 16 counties that we serve in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2742)|

| 0:45:53| projects, we've had over 100,000 volunteer hours, and if you multiply that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2753)|

| 0:46:15| are a nonprofit organization, and we have a goal to make East Tennessee a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2775)|

| 0:46:34| do, Mayor, I went back to check to see how long the city has been assisting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| Design Center, and I know it's probably been the last 52 years, but the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| we have is that you folks have been donating money to us for the last at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| least 25 years that we've been in existence, and we appreciate that $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| and we hope that you continue to do that. Plus there's additional funds that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| given to us also. I did want to let you know that as far as the projects, in 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| we completed 18 projects, 13 of which those were our CDBG funds that you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| helped finance. Five other projects were from either outside the area or from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| projects for people that don't qualify under the CDBG. In 1922 so far, we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| 21 projects, 11 of which are the CDBG projects, and 10 other projects are from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| other nonprofits that don't qualify. So again, what I wanted to do is just take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| few minutes to explain that. Some of you may not be aware of the process that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| go through, and I want to touch base on that. Basically what happens if it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| a city project that falls under the CDBG, what happens is a nonprofit will come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| us. We don't go out soliciting nonprofit work, but a nonprofit will come to us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| they have four qualifications of which they have to meet. Number one, they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| to be a 501c3 in order to qualify first. Then they also have to show us that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| are a benefit to the community and also a benefit to their members. The group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| also has to show that financially in the very beginning of their project, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| where we're involved, that they really don't have the finances to do this. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| what we do is we provide the service to help them take their vision and basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| we go as far as what we call schematic design. We do not do architectural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| services from the standpoint of once the design or the vision is set, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| basically happens is that then the nonprofit is able to go out and raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| funds. So basically we help them with their fundraising. Once they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| then that's when they hire an architect or engineer or whatever in order to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| the project on that. And then the other thing is that we ask them that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2927)|

| 0:48:55| do the project. So basically a nonprofit comes to us, they're vetted through my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| staff, they then go to a committee called the Design Works Committee that listens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| to what it is that they want done or how we are able to help them and whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| or not they qualify with the four qualification factors. And then it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| to the full board for approval. Then we solicit the volunteers. We have a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| of volunteers that we go to. We send out a request. The volunteer is then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| selected. The volunteer then meets with the group and then the project proceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| from there. So that's pretty much what we do. But again, what I wanted to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| I really wanted to thank the City, Mayor, and City Council, and especially the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| City staff for the work that all of you have done for the Design Center over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| last, well, probably 52 years. So again, Mayor, thank you very much and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| appreciate the grant on that. So thank you. If there's any questions, I'm here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| answer. Thank you, Mr. Grieve. We appreciate you. I first encountered the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| help of the Design Center through my work with Bell-Morris Elementary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| they wanted an addition and they want to do it green and sustainable. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| school system didn't have the funds to do a sustainable type of addition. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| anyhow, the Design Center really helped the community come together and tap into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| what they wanted and needed and then, you know, help make it happen. So that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| many years ago and I know it's just one of many projects you do in Knoxville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| beyond. Thank you very much. We look forward to continue working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3029)|

| 0:51:08| participated in the public forum held last night about this document and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3068)|
| 0:51:17| a little confused about next steps based on what I heard. I believe I heard the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| next step for the plan shared by Bennett Meeks was that it would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| before City Council for a revision. Did I hear that correctly? I'm gonna ask Linda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| Rust if you could... oh, oh, I'm sorry. Amy, sorry. Do you want to tackle that first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| Ms. Brooks? I can start and then... Okay, perfect. Ms. Rust can fill in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| gaps. I am relatively new here so I'm sure I might overlook something but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| Councilmember Parker, this is the first step in the City accepting these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| So basically this plan is saying, yes, we will accept these funds. This is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| we will be using these funds for. It does not identify the priorities but it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| not identify the recipients of the funding. So that's when after HUD reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| it, if this body does indeed approve the plan and it goes to HUD and HUD approves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| it, then the next step would be for any future recipients, most of those grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| would come back before Council for review and approval. So it seemed like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| there were a lot of concerns on the call last night and a lot of concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| the process for soliciting that public input and it was unclear to me if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3158)|
| 0:52:51| are, you know, so many voices concerned about where the money is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3171)|
| 0:52:59| allocated, how does the City plan to incorporate that feedback from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| community? Because it seems like the uses have already been set. Again, so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3185)|
| 0:53:15| purpose of this plan is to identify what those priorities are. It was not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| actually grant the funding yet out to individual. I would say there was a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3198)|
| 0:53:26| of really good feedback last night and I know that the staff met today to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| discuss that feedback and talk about other avenues and we really do need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| think about a more robust process going forward and just thinking about more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| opportunities for input. But I will say that there has been a lot of input into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| this plan itself and the process. There's been a number of consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| meetings that are identified in your packet here, but again I don't, I know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| staff has summarized all the input that was identified last night and we will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| identifying some next steps in terms of, you know, how we can do a better job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| using this input to inform future efforts. Well, I would include in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| not just the home ARP funds, but all of our affordable housing funds. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3254)|
| 0:54:24| what I keep hearing from the community and what I heard last night are that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| folks are currently providing services, helping folks get into housing, are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| getting the support and the preference continues to be that the city work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| the large agencies and especially when there's federal money involved, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| seems to be quite nervous with granting that to the smaller grassroots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| organizations, but who are providing extremely critical services. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3289)|
| 0:54:58| struggling with whether to vote in favor of this plan, you know, knowing that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3298)|
| 0:55:08| community partners haven't been identified for the funding, simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| because I'm not sure if the uses identified are the best uses for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| funding. The conversation last night seemed to focus on wanting feedback from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3324)|
| 0:55:34| the community. What's before us today doesn't seem to, it doesn't seem like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3334)|
| 0:55:45| we're going to have much discussion here tonight, but there's a full plan laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| to support the supportive services and the permanent supportive housing and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3350)|
| 0:56:02| think that we should have that conversation with the public about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| made the city decide that this was a good use of the funds and that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| be able to actually spend these funds on those designated uses. Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| Parker, that concludes your five minutes. Council Member, I mean Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Roberto. Thank you, Mayor. Director Brooks, this item, just to make sure I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| what we're doing here, is the city has been awarded over four million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| in grants and what we're asked you to do this evening is to vote to accept four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| million dollars for certain purposes, is that right? That is correct. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| purposes that HUD has provided for this funding, are those specified? Are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| limited? Are they, we can do anything we want with these funds? No, if you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| have your plan, the plan in front of you on page two, it does identify the, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| talks about this new funding program, HOMARP, and the assistance. Who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| supposed to assist as well as the type of assistance that should be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| as part of a part of this plan. Okay, and so we've got limited uses that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| use the four million dollars for, but for next steps what we have to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| identify, maybe not specifically what we're, you know, organizations that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| going to use money for, but what maybe in more broad strokes, is that right? What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| we're going to do with the four million dollars, over four million dollars? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| correct. Okay, and it looks like from what I remember from the packet, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3461)|
| 0:57:50| got a million dollars in supportive services for people who are either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| experiencing or on the verge of or at risk of experiencing homelessness, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| well as 2.9 million dollars to develop affordable rental housing, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| correct? Yes, that's correct, and that's on page 23 of the plan. Okay, I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| to make sure I was clear what we were doing. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| Council members, I just wanted to add that even though our needs in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| community are probably greater than they have been in recent memory, this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| and this city have dedicated more funding towards housing in the last few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| years than ever before, and that's not just the federal dollars, that's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| local dollars. So just in the last two years, we've dedicated, appropriated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| budgeted, with your support, 18 million dollars towards housing, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3523)|

| 0:58:58| public meetings, just on this agenda item, and for the last several years, permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| supportive housing has been identified by many stakeholders and practitioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| throughout the community as the number one need. It's not the only need, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| not the only need we're meeting, but through these funds, it is the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| has been identified as the top priority. It's also pretty expensive, and so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| important that we are good stewards of these dollars and take advantage, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| appropriate, of economies of scale and try to serve as many people, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| that's all things that we take into account as we review these opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| Councilmember Parker. Thank you. I just wanted to point out on page 24 what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| just trying to get clarity on in this agenda item. It says, to increase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| supply of permanent supportive housing, the city will provide home art funds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| the provision of supportive services for 100 unit public permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3592)|

| 1:00:03| 58 units of new permanent supportive housing, and additionally 30 units of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| affordable housing for families will be developed. So for sake of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| all I've been asking for is to clarify what are the hundred units of permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| supportive housing that have already been identified for the supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| services? Do we have a project already identified to develop 58 units of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| permanent supportive housing? Because if we don't, we've just funded one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3632)|

| 1:01:49| within months rather than years, and so I'm not saying that my idea is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220920?start=3709)|
