| 0:08:47| that aren't representing those industries that those industries are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| are well represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=533)|

| 0:11:57| well to speak to this resolution but what we were tasked with doing was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| taking several parcels and combining them into one getting approval from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=723)|

| 0:12:18| Daly. That's all I had to do with it. I understand Mr. James is here as you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| Mr. Paul James. I'd like to introduce Mr. Paul James he's the director of Iams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=742)|
| 0:12:32| Nature Center and for the record I don't know if it matters or not the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| director can correct me but I am a board member de facto board member since I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| a ninth district commissioner but could you tell us about Meds Quarry and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| the plans are for Meds Quarry as far as Iams future goes? Yes Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| Daly. First of all my name is Paul James and the executive director at Iams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Nature Center 2915 Island Home Avenue. Meds Quarry came under our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| management in 2001 when former Commissioner Howard Pinkston was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| commission and we work with the county and numerous volunteers and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| organizations to clean up was one of the worst areas of illegal dump in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| County since the late 70s. We opened it with the county in 2005 we added nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| trails and since then it has gone from like I said a horrible place to one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| the jewel in the crown at Knox County and city parks and we're proud of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| the efforts that Iams and partners and volunteers have brought to the table. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| work with the Center of Historic Preservation in Nashville in 2013 to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| it to the National Register of Historic Places and since it's been incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| into the larger Knoxville urban wilderness so we appreciate Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| support and everyone to make Meds Quarry a success and great part of Iams. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| you. I did not realize but Iams Nature Center is a private I won't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| corporation but it's a private entity that the city of Knoxville does not own or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| Knox County does not really own that park it's just we own the Meds part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| it which you know next week it might be transferred to over to Iams but it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| beautiful park. I've had one or two responses about what if and this is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| the law director I'm pretty sure the question will be 20 years 30 years 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| years from now Iams decides that it's going to be sold to a corporation or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| what happens to the 45 acres of Knox County. Within the actual deed itself we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=874)|
| 0:14:44| have prepared reverter clauses as it relates to recreation for Iams itself. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| also have added a section in there whereby any fee transfer has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| approved by the citizens of Knox County through this body. So I think that Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| County has been pretty well protected to where it will in the future maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| whatever use it is that the citizens want 20-30 years from now. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| what that may be but at least the community will still have a say in it if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| it is transferred. And I will mention that I have had a few emails from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| James about the insurance that we'll have that Iams has to pay each year to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| cover and it is a tremendous amount and this will be a liability off in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| County. That's correct. Thank you. Thank you Mr. James. Commissioner Daly for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| purpose now of continued discussion do you wish to make a motion? Motion I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| like to make a motion to approve item 58 on the today's agenda. Is that good enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| That's good enough. Did I hear a second? Second. Commissioner Anders. Yes sir. Hey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| Mr. James real quick I really want to I really have enjoyed the work you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| have done over there and y'all done a great job. Thank you. One question here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| the on the revert back on the deed. Number four it says the grantor or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| grantee agreed that they shall not charge or permit to be charged any fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| for entry or use of the property by the general public. Now River Sports is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| currently operating over there on a rental fee. This this as written would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| not allow that to happen if I'm reading it correctly. I have not seen the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=980)|

| 0:16:34| educational programs and we've been doing that since the 1970s. Mr. Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| Director does that affect not charging entry in but they're charging entry for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| the equipment or rental for the equipment is that I don't want that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| affect their they got a good product or they don't want it to affect it. Right the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| way I read it is if you want to use one of their boats or canoes you rent it if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| you bring your own you get access free. You can't bring anything in there River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1014)|

| 0:17:01| that's true that is true because the Meats Quarry Lake is about 12 acres in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| size and we've deemed it unsafe to allow people to bring in boats because then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| can't control the number of boats on that lake. Well they can't you can't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| bring your own kayak in. That's correct. So we need to over the next week we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| to determine this deed would not allow River Sports which does a great job by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| the way to continue to operate under that. I would be concerned about that too because we've had a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| partnership. It's a great partnership. We provide a great service to the community. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| something we need to review Mr. Law Director? I'll check on it and have your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1054)|

| 0:19:17| was wondering would the law director on the rental if it's not I'm charging the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| admission fee I think it'll depend on how that contract that they have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| River Sports is. I don't know we can make some exceptions for River Sports or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| they're exclusive they're the only ones that can put boats in the water on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1171)|

| 0:19:49| we've allowed this to happen. Can I mention I think probably more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| appropriate to say a recreational vendor because River Sports could change. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1195)|

| 0:27:51| somebody in it's only going to be for 30 days Commissioner Anders well I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1671)|
| 0:28:02| I think you're really you know I think that district I think mr. Armstrong's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| district covered first second maybe a little bit of the ninth districts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| so that's correct and so I think it's really incumbent upon what what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| desire is but I would I would think that I mean I don't know that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| time to publicly notice because we don't have a resolution approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Commission to fill the seat and so by the time you did that next Monday you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| got a public notice it even if you had a special called meeting two weeks later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| you're looking at a maybe a 21-day appointment reading reading what I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| from the state of Tennessee by resolution we could appoint at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| stated meeting you could appoint you could have the resolution to a point and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| then appoint somebody in the same without posting the job you don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| resolution for the reason I started with Commissioner Gill because she represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| the majority of that district and I do realize district two and nine are a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| of it and I agree and they they will have the opportunity to also make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| nominations and amongst those nominations we will appoint someone so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| between now and Monday you expect the districts to bring somebody forward or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| the other option is to I think it's Senator I think it's Senator Massey's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| district as well I'm not sure if exactly right maybe Commissioner Dr. Briggs but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| no the reason I named dr. Briggs was only because he assisted me I'm talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| about who's whose Senate district is that I think it's miss Massey's it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| and so or we could allow her to represent the district on constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| issues because I don't think there'll be another special I mean there's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| options there is to allow the citizens to pick in November and let miss miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1801)|

| 0:30:10| to me if miss Gill wants to appoint a little point but I mean we're we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| gonna put them into the state HR for 30 days and then pull them out of state HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| the very two or three days later so but that's something to chew on I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1819)|

| 0:30:41| this way may I speak yes most certainly thank you it this seems fruitful to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| because we have an election that's coming up the legislature is if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| a special called session we have senators who could represent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| interests and and I don't know what we would be accomplishing by naming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| someone who's possibly not even in the election other than to confuse things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| does that make sense most certainly does thank you so I would suggest that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| just leave it as it is and as my friend Brown would say let that dog lie and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| the reason I read the four or five sentences at the beginning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| discussion the reason I read the four or five sentences at the beginning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| discussion was to make sure that we knew there is no punishment for not doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| and there is also a path by which we can make an appointment I did not take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| position in anything I just wanted to make sure that we started at with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| knowledge of what's before us I'm sure now Commissioner Caringer I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| to clarify when you were saying district 2 are you saying that representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| Armstrong's came into district 2 County Commission seat district are there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| there voting precincts that have him on their ballot in your that Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| seat no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| Bill Morris is not in the second district no that when that was all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| redistrict that goes to first I will read out who we do have if you want me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| to know I just said that because I wanted to make sure I covered all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| bases right that's why I wanted to clarify and let everyone know and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| you're listening on TV or here representative Armstrong seat does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| come in to district 2 County Commission and I would also reemphasize the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| that any Commissioner could make a nomination to fill that seat Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| Daly Thank You mr. chairman I was mr. Armstrong's district does cover the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| community of Vestal and I believe some of Island home area down there I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| really know that we need to fill this seat at this point in time I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| interested if it if this resolution comes forward I'd be interested to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| who the nominee might be I wouldn't be for a candidate at this point in time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| to give that advantage to a certain candidate so that's just my personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| opinion we'll we'll see how the rest of the Commission feels and that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| reason that the discussion item is before us to see if the resolution would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| be brought and to make sure that everyone understands the ground rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| for which we would be playing by or directed to abide by by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| Commissioner Carringer thank you I just wanted to say that I hope that if anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| is interested in all that they would contact all the Commissioners that we as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| a body would do what we feel like the at will of the people in that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| won't if they want you know someone to be elected I understand I mean it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| short time so I would like for everybody that is that thinks about it that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| would contact every Commissioner and let them know how they feel about it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| their for it or not Commissioner Schoonmaker thank you Mr. Chairman two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| quick questions one would be could we not hold have the resolution on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2077)|
| 0:34:49| regular agenda next Monday finishing our regular meeting and then call a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| session after that meeting and then second question is in the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| that you receive from the officials of the state is the day after the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| is that person the now the new state representative or is it after the 14 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| when the election is certified which means that if you theoretically appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| somebody the 1st of October they could serve till almost Thanksgiving which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| would be almost two months the verbiage that I have says until the next general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2125)|
| 0:35:36| election so I believe I would interpret that to mean upon the certification of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2136)|
| 0:35:45| that election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| because I'm trying to remember when we appointed Dr. Briggs to the Senate seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| and then he was elected I believe the next day he was actually considered a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Tennessee state senator the day after the election even though he was not it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| wasn't certified for 14 days he wasn't sworn into the 2nd of January and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| is correct he was called the next day and given his executive assistant's name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| his telephone number and his parking pass but that is beyond the scope of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| what we're in charge of so what I'm looking at then is I think on the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| wise then theoretically it's about a five week period and it does not it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2187)|
| 0:36:37| almost like we're saying we don't know whether it matters or it doesn't but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| that's not the issue that's before us the issue that will be before us next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| Monday is a resolution that this commission appoint someone to fill this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| seat and there will be nominations and the resolution will then contain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| name of the nominee and the resolution will be passed or fail if there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| resolution brought to us. Commissioner Gill. Yes sir I just need to make sure I got some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| clarifying questions answered so you can't call a special session because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| need a number of days for the meeting notice to be given we're really looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| at 25 days for an appointment is that roughly correct or a little longer 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2244)|
| 0:37:35| I would I would again like to rein us in I just need to make a number of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| the number of days the issue that is before us is will will we or will we not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| right have a resolution before us at the next stated meeting which will seek to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| appoint someone to the seat vacated in district 15 and if there is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| before us Commission will then be charged with filling a name through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| nominating process and then passing that resolution that's that's the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| things that are before us. Can I give a point of order? If you bring a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2289)|
| 0:38:18| Monday that's fine but it has to pass two-thirds of the majority to be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| on the agenda. That's correct. Unless you call a special call meeting with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| resolution on it. And as you're pointing out it is very specific in what the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| rules require okay and if it passes all of that stuff we will be in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| with whichever direction we will go we'll be in compliance with what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| State of Tennessee has given us. Commissioner Smith. Okay. Thank You Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2329)|
| 0:38:58| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Could we have a special call meeting following I think we have a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| beer board agenda. No beer board agenda? You don't have one. Can we do it at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| Are you asking if we should call a special call meeting in place of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| board? Yes. I can do that. But you don't have the resolution. No we would not have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| resolution but I can call a meeting because I have five days to call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| meeting. You put it on the agenda the resolution is the agenda. These are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| the this is the act of Commission here now it's not if that's what you wish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| ask for I can do that. I think you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2390)|
| 0:39:58| Jolie said we would have to put it to notice in the paper. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2398)|
| 0:40:12| I'm a pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2412)|
| 0:40:28| We can't hear. Mandy would be the fifth day. We're in discussion right at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| moment about the five-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| I can call a meeting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2442)|
| 0:40:52| Commissioner Gill would would you be agreeable to the fact that we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| called meeting of Knox County Commission with the sole agenda item to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| consider the appointment to the 15th district seat at 4 p.m. next Monday? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| Okay as the chair of Knox County Commission at this time I call a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| special called meeting of the Knox County Commission to discuss the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2476)|
| 0:41:28| the appointment to the Tennessee state legislative seat district 15 for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2488)|
| 0:41:37| possibilities of filling that seat due to the retirement of representative Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| Armstrong. Mr. Law Director does that satisfy the requirement of the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2503)|
| 0:41:54| County Commission having a called meeting? Yes. The single agenda item to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| the appointment the question of the appointment to this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2521)|
| 0:42:13| Commissioner Daley. I can bring this up next week but this is going to open up a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| can of worms of how many votes it's going to take if this person's nominated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| and they if it's one person that's nominated and they don't get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| majority of the votes then it's all for naught it's over with and is it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| majority or is it a two-thirds vote or we'll need to have all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| clarification before all this start happening you know I've had one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| one person keeps calling and wants to be nominated to that position but I've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| made up my mind if I would nominate this person or not but that's this neither| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| here nor there it's just that it's the procedures that we're going to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| that might be confusing and I don't want to go into a four o'clock meeting that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| going to last eight or nine o'clock over confusions. I would say this about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| meeting it will not last past five o'clock. Still before us is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| purpose of the meeting and the meeting Mr. Law Director would be to pass the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| resolution would be simple majority is that correct? The called meeting with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| five-day notice would be to consider this one resolution which would be passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| if passed by a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| Special call meeting has to be with specificity that the the purpose of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2619)|
| 0:43:50| agenda meeting on the agenda is to appoint someone to fill the vacancy in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| the 15th representative district of the state of Tennessee. That's all that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| resolution will probably say and then the chairman would then open it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| for nominations. I don't know how he'll do it. He may go to the first and the ninth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| first then he may say are there other people and then then once you have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| nominations and those nominations are ceased you vote through and the one who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| gets six votes goes to Nashville. Now is the person that's placed on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| resolution then the resolution is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2672)|
| 0:44:42| Oh she turned the light off. I did. I need to figure out how to phrase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker had his light on in front of you this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| Mine's brighter. Could the people who want to be considered as an applicant just give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2694)|
| 0:45:05| one-page only resume to the Commission office prior to our special called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| meeting? Yes I can make that a I can make that a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| Commissioner Brantley. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm just wondering how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2718)|

| 0:45:27| position if we if they're voted for it and and once again I go back to what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| said we're talking about about 20 days and there's an election that the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| is going to vote someone into that seat and is this really necessary since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| legislature is not even in session and are we just taking a lot of time here or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| is there an underlying purpose for nominating someone and putting them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| that position? Yes there is an underlying purpose for for. Do they get paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| this position? The the purpose the underlying purpose for this is stated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| this letter from the counselor. That says you can't or you don't have to. It doesn't say you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| And it's by our vote and we can't vote today but you will be able to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Monday. So this candidate this person will get paid for this position they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| become a state legislator for 20 days and and they'll be eligible for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| those privileges that that goes with being a state legislator is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| And that's beyond the scope of our discussion. Well I think that's things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| you need to consider if you're going to vote for a man. Yes. I mean all of this is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| consideration. I think there's a lot of things to consider and the person that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| we've that we nominate and vote for how are all of us going to know if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| qualified or not except on that meeting day we're each going to get a piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| paper. Who knows if it's real? So it I just think there's a and and and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| community has already voted or they're about to vote. They voted in a primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| now they're going to have a general election and I think we're kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| superseding what they're trying to do there but that's mine. And and and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| have legitimate ownership of that opinion. I support you in your opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| Commissioner Gill. Okay so I have a better statement because I respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Commissioner Brantley and I think we whether I withdraw the resolution for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| the special call meeting one and if the process takes place in November then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| allow your constituents who vote in the first district decide who that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| to be. Thank you. So the the request to present a resolution at special call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| meeting has been withdrawn. Yes sir. Thank you ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Seeing no further lights moving to the next discussion item. In the meeting of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| the annual schedule of Knox County Commission, January the 16th is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2878)|
| 0:48:14| So by our rule the meeting will move to the next day the 17th, a Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2894)|
| 0:48:25| Our current timing conflicts with the previously scheduled City Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2905)|
| 0:48:38| City Council has priority on Tuesday evenings so that we have a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2918)|
| 0:48:47| three options. We can move a week earlier some day. We can move a day or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| two later some day. Or in my opinion we could just meet earlier in the day. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2935)|
| 0:49:06| in January. It could be a cold day. We could meet at 1 30 or 2 o'clock with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2946)|
| 0:49:16| time-specific window. It allows the agenda to be established as it normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2956)|
| 0:49:25| would be. It allows us to take into consideration the holiday and it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| does not then push us further toward the regular scheduled meeting of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2970)|
| 0:49:40| So it would be my thought that we could meet earlier in the day on January 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2980)|
| 0:49:49| Do I hear a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| Commissioner Smith. Thank you Mr. Chair. What time is the City Council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=2995)|
| 0:50:04| It may be the night of their beer board or something like that which is then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| even earlier. It's 6 and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3009)|
| 0:50:25| Can you hear that? We'd have to be out by 4 30. We would have to be out by 4 30 so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| let's say 4 and back up two hours is 2 o'clock. It's 2 o'clock is the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| session meeting. There we go. On which day is that the 16th? It's on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3040)|
| 0:50:52| The 17th at 2 p.m. will be the work session of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| If there be no objection that will be our scheduled day. Seeing no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3059)|
| 0:51:07| objection, Madam Director will you complete the schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3067)|
| 0:51:17| The next discussion item was on the Audit Committee. Earlier today the Audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Committee met. I tried to get Commissioner Schoonmaker to read his notes and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| notes look as bad as my notes so I'm going to read my notes and he's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| compare when I finish. I want to make about four comments on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| Audit Committee meeting. I want to reemphasize that there is a hotline here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| in Knox County to report fraud, waste and abuse. This past month we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3106)|
| 0:51:55| three reports. Two have been referred to the school system. One was at the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3115)|
| 0:52:05| County Adaptive Education location. One was at Shenandoah Elementary and one has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| not been referred, still resides with the risk assessment group here in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3132)|
| 0:52:21| County and is yet to be referred. The reason that I mention this is to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| sure that people coming on to Commission know that there is a fraud, waste and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| abuse hotline, an 800 number, calls answered outside of Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| complete anonymity if you wish to seal that to report questionable activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3161)|
| 0:52:51| in Knox County. The second thing that was given to us at the Audit Committee was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| report from Finance Director Mr. Caldwell saying that we're in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| of closing the books. The external auditor has been in a couple offices for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| the last week or so, but the real intense beginning of the external audit will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| commence this week. There will be then reports of such sometime early in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| December, we hope. Then the external auditor spoke, Mr. Larry Elmore of Pew & Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| he spoke about risk and that relating to the fraud, waste and abuse hotline and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| other issues helped them with their external audit. They are looking at high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| risk areas such as grants, receivables, revenue and he also notified us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3220)|
| 0:53:50| there had been an enlargement of the engagement which may be doing some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| additional work in the audit area externally of the L&N STEM Academy. Also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3237)|
| 0:54:06| coming from Pew & Company was a report by Mr. Ted Holtz about the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| activity funds that the audits of 88 schools have been complete. They are ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3251)|
| 0:54:21| of schedule. They had very good assistance from the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| the school system and are looking forward to reviewing circumstances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| have been found with Garrett Raley with schools. We also spoke for a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| about the internal auditor where internal audits should be directed. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| would say to full commission that the audit committee is looking forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| reviewing the plans of the internal auditor. Having reviewed those plans of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3291)|
| 0:55:00| the internal auditor, the audit committee is in charge of that but will work at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| the direction of full commission. The next meeting of the audit committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| December the 12th at 2 p.m. The audit committee will meet December the 12th at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| 2 p.m. Do I have further discussion from Commissioner Schoonmaker? Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| Just one other item I thought was interesting. Mr. Caldwell said that due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| to the increase in sales tax that the Knox County schools will have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| additional six million dollars added to their budget due to sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| collections. I thought that was pretty good. Commissioner Nystrom, as a member of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| the audit committee, your comments please. A couple of other areas that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| external auditor identified as risk areas included investments, our debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| piece, IRS. We had some interest rate swaps and timing of revenue recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| Another thing as it relates to this board, we have members of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| County Commission on our pension committee and they have completed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| audit of the pension group. It is a two-step audit. They've completed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| first step of that which is related to compliance which was done in August. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| October they will be doing a more detailed audit as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| balances in particular accounts. Thank you. Thank you Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| Finance Director Mr. Caldwell. Just a correction to what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| Schoonmaker said. I think what I stated was that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| school's sales tax was six million dollars above what was budgeted for in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| 2016 and that was counted in the budget for 2017. They would like your answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| better I'm sure. It scared me back there. While you're there, Mr. Caldwell, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3411)|
| 0:57:00| my social page out of the new Sentinel. Please stick her in. I need to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| autographed before you leave. A society scene person. Seeing no further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3427)|
| 0:57:16| discussion, continuing with discussion items, I wanted to make comment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| Commission orientation that was held on reorganization day. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Schoonmaker and I attended most of those sessions along with the new Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| members. A great deal of information was distributed. It just leads to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| that we have had presented to us, I'll call it management's portion or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3464)|
| 0:57:53| administration's portion of Knox County. I'm looking forward to an afternoon with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| the Sheriff. I would like to get scheduled a afternoon with the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| Department for a review of the programs presented or administered by the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3484)|
| 0:58:13| Department. I need some information about an available afternoon so we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3493)|
| 0:58:21| that scheduled. If you'd look at your calendars and sort of pull out dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3501)|
| 0:58:30| that are not agreeable or dates that would be agreeable, I would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| this as a discussion item next Monday. The reason being I will get with Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3514)|
| 0:58:43| Dooley and the Sheriff's Office to get some two or three or four dates from her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| of when it would best fit with Sheriff's Department for orientations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| I would envision this covering things like the detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| facility, the air arm of Knox County, the river rescue, the Plano law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3537)|
| 0:59:09| and how crime is tracked in Knox County. A presentation from the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| Department. Is there any further discussion of that? If not, I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| brings to an end the discussion items that I had. The next thing that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3562)|
| 0:59:31| before us at this time might be announcements. I would call your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| attention to the Legacy Parks Luncheon which is Friday, October the 7th at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| It will be at UT's Cherokee Farm on Alcoa Highway. And if you are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| attend, please contact the Commission Office so that we can get discretionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| funds to cover your attendance to that Legacy Parks Luncheon Friday, October the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| 7th at 1130. The Commissioners Night Out, the At-Large Commissioners Night Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| Commissioner Thomas. Thank you Mr. Chairman. It is going to be this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Wednesday from 5 to 7. As usual, everybody is invited to join us whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| you're an elected official in Knox County or public citizens. Everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| welcome to come out. It's going to be at my neighbor Archer's Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| It's going to be at 408 Gay Street, 5 to 7 this Wednesday. Come out and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| some Memphis-style barbecue with us. And these are well-attended meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160919?start=3634)|
