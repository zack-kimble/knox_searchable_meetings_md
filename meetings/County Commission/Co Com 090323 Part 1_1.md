| 2:37:35| and that selection was made a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:41| Can I add something just real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| Amy, you were asking for the 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| Could you, as part of that, ask the law director to look into whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9469)|
| 2:37:54| or not the insurance committee should have been involved in this as part of that delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9474)|
| 2:38:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| And I also would like to know if the health department had been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9482)|
| 2:38:06| if they could provide these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| Are you finished, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| Can I make one comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| When Francis referred to the insurance committee, we were not charged to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| If you will go back to our meetings and look at the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| this has been discussed and it was voted down by the insurance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| This has come up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| This is not the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| I have a friend of mine who does something similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| but it's all done with an 800 number by phone and for several different companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9521)|
| 2:38:47| I'm just wondering if that has been explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| And just to make that comment, after making that comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| I will call for the question with the amendments because we've spent enough time on this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9534)|
| 2:39:04| We don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| I'll second that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| We have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9554)|
| 2:39:20| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9560)|

| 2:39:23| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9563)|

| 2:39:26| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9567)|
| 2:39:28| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9575)|
| 2:39:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| Commissioner Schaust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9593)|
| 2:39:54| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| Out of respect for the lights that are on, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9606)|
| 2:40:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9607)|
| 2:40:08| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9608)|
| 2:40:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:26| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9626)|
| 2:40:27| Motion fails 11-0-7, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| One recused himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| I want to make a comment that we do have the motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| a substitute motion, is to defer for 30 days and have the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| and do all this and other people to do certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| so we do need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| But Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| Well, I just wanted to say I would have to agree with Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| whether it's 30 days or 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| I cannot vote for an RN to be the coach to maybe 50 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| And to say that they only have three to five minutes to spend with their primary care doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| on discussing their high blood pressure or diabetes I know is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| Knox County does provide insurance for all of their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| and most of you have the opportunity to go to the doctor of your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| If you want to pay a little bit more, the others can absolutely find doctors in their network to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9682)|
| 2:41:29| At some point, we have to quit babying people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| They have to take responsibility for their own health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| and we can keep putting things out there and having people come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| I fully understand what you're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| but I also know that the majority of it does not work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| and you've got to take responsibility for your own health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| and it seems that the ones that do take care of their health, do work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:55| they keep getting penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| So I feel like that an employee of Knox County has the opportunity to have the doctor of their choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9717)|
| 2:42:04| and that doctor is the one that's going to have to come down to making the orders as to what prescriptions they take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9724)|
| 2:42:11| You can't have someone coaching you on how to change your cholesterol medicine and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| because that doesn't work without having your regular labs taken, just as Commissioner Lambert pointed out earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:23| So anybody that's in that serious health pretty much has to go to the doctor every three months to get their lab work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9743)|
| 2:42:31| So I don't think that I could, this day and time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| when there's 38 custodians losing their jobs and teachers losing their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| I cannot see paying an RN $60,000 a year and the total package over $100,000 a year right now in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9759)|
| 2:42:48| So I'm not trying to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| I just know reality and I know what works in the health field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:59| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9779)|
| 2:43:06| The lady from Summit, would you come back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9789)|
| 2:43:14| This gets down to saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| This gets down to saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| And so what we've heard is a lot of, and I respect my colleague's opinions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9799)|
| 2:43:25| but we have kind of a, and I wish Dr. Briggs was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| He's the only physician we have on here, but he won't speak for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| Well, yeah, he's got some kind of financial interest, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| So do you have something beyond just anecdotal evidence that this works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9817)|
| 2:43:47| and it will help us save money on insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| I have some studies that I could bring that show the ROI nationally for different companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| ranging between three to one to three to six, depending on how the programs are structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| So, yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| So you'll provide this for all these parties involved, I assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| That's what I want to see, too, is I want to see the research that backs up the savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| because if this is going to generate a savings for the county, then I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| I also want to know if the health department was asked if they could provide these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| Mark Jones with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| We looked at this a couple years ago, and it was decided when I talked with our public health officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| that this would be inappropriate and unethical for us to administer a program of our fellow employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9879)|
| 2:44:47| So we don't think it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9892)|
| 2:44:53| And I know this from personal recent experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| Doesn't Kheriton have an 800 number already where you can call for more information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| And I know that they have been, since I've been in and out of the hospital so much lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:08| they have been in constant contact with me to see if there's any way that they can help me improve my health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9908)|
| 2:45:15| if there's anything that they can do for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| How am I doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| I mean, they call me every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| They would like to know if my head surgery was a result of something that happened at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9920)|
| 2:45:26| I would love to tell them that, yes, it is, from working through these meetings, but, no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9926)|
| 2:45:33| So I feel like Kheriton, as our insurance provider, really does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9933)|
| 2:45:39| We have Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Wrong insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| I remind you I recently had head surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| But our insurance company, I think, does a great job of staying in touch with people who are using the insurance frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9947)|
| 2:45:57| So I don't think we can overlook the role that they are already playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9957)|
| 2:46:04| And I want to see the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| That's why I'm asking for a 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9972)|
| 2:46:13| I know we've been on this a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| The numbers he put out, I think we all agree medical inflation is triple the CPI, triple regular inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9975)|
| 2:46:23| And it's finally, I think, just now come below double figures, down to about 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| But you said the plan loses money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| You mean Cigna loses money, or we're about to go through that $20 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| How do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| I mean, there's no medical plan in the country that makes money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| It's how little you lose is the way I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| So what do you mean it loses money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| Since January of 2008, the county has been self-insured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| and we set our premiums based on an expectation just to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10004)|
| 2:46:49| But right now, three out of our four plans are costing more than what we're bringing in through employee contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10009)|
| 2:46:56| and taxpayer contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| So it's costing more than what we budgeted for, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| That's correct, and what we ask the employees to pay through their payroll deduction, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10021)|
| 2:47:06| Okay, look, on our pay slip, there's the deduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| and then it shows the county's match of about triple the deduction, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| So the number that's been budgeted there is not adequate to provide the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10034)|
| 2:47:19| Yeah, we're about 15 months into a self-insured program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| and it's very clear that costs are going up, just like you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| And we're going to have to make some hard choices in either benefit coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| or in how much contribution there is either through the county or through the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10051)|
| 2:47:36| And that's on its way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| And so what Ms. Fogerson's proposal here is to help reduce that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| because I think you'll see next month that there's going to be opportunities to save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10062)|
| 2:47:46| and reduce the effect, either benefit cuts or premium increases, because it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10066)|
| 2:47:51| It's just a matter of how much and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| How does the $20 million come into play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| Is that catastrophic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| We have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| If we were to spend more than that, we have reinsurance, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| We do have reinsurance, and that's a total program on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10085)|
| 2:48:09| Our reinsurance kicks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| The number, I hope I'm saying this correctly, is $250,000 per person per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| And so when we have one person who has that much in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| and I think we've had three since we've been self-insured that have reached that plateau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10100)|
| 2:48:28| And we have not purchased the aggregate reinsurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| We just made a financial decision not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| But that could be something we do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| And why is the $20 million a relevant number in the debate today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10117)|
| 2:48:41| I'm lost on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| It helps it put into context if you have $20 million in claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10123)|
| 2:48:46| and what you're spending is $100,000 to minimize how much you spend of that $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10126)|
| 2:48:53| You have $20 million of total population and try to save money through claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10133)|
| 2:48:57| There's $20 million of claims out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10137)|
| 2:49:00| To me, it's not a stretch to say, okay, we should spend $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| I'm getting my numbers confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| We should spend $100,000 to keep that $20 million as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| Is that our projected exposure, $20 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| That's what our spending rate is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| $20 million a year on health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| That's deductions and taxpayer supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10162)|
| 2:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10165)|
| 2:49:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10168)|
| 2:49:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10174)|
| 2:49:36| 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10176)|
| 2:49:41| 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| I move for consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| to create a task force to address challenges and issues related to an increased senior population in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10185)|
| 2:49:51| Resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10191)|
| 2:49:55| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| Intergovernmental, 7-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10197)|
| 2:50:00| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10200)|
| 2:50:01| 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10204)|
| 2:50:07| I would like to amend this to add another commissioner onto the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10207)|
| 2:50:12| Commissioner Kerringer has indicated an interest in working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10212)|
| 2:50:16| so I'd like to amend it to include her as part of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10216)|
| 2:50:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| So it's a motion to approve with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10230)|
| 2:50:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10231)|
| 2:50:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10232)|
| 2:50:33| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| I'm just thinking here out loud, with having two commissioners now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10237)|
| 2:50:41| you understand the added need for the sunshine in all your meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10241)|
| 2:50:47| and you may have to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10247)|
| 2:50:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10250)|
| 2:50:51| All of our meetings will be publicly noticed, whether there is two commissioners or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| I'm good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| Any time we get more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| I'm good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| Let the sun shine in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10267)|
| 2:51:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10268)|
| 2:51:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10269)|
| 2:51:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10270)|
| 2:51:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10271)|
| 2:51:16| 9-0-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| Does that include, I think there was discussion, at least in committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| about is there only one commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| There's two now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10287)|
| 2:51:28| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10288)|
| 2:51:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10289)|
| 2:51:33| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| expressing the opposition of the Knox County Board of Commissioners to H.R. 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10299)|
| 2:51:43| a measure currently pending in the U.S. House of Representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10303)|
| 2:51:46| that would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of gun owners in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| Resolution 9-0-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10310)|
| 2:51:53| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10313)|
| 2:51:54| 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10314)|
| 2:51:55| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10315)|
| 2:51:56| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10321)|
| 2:52:02| H.R. 45 is an extremely far-reaching gun control act that, if it passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10322)|
| 2:52:07| will certainly affect the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| It requires the licensing of owners of firearms that have the ability to accept a magazine greater than 10 rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10331)|
| 2:52:21| It also requires registration of individual firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10341)|
| 2:52:27| Essentially what this act would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| it would be the restrictions that we have in place now for exotic weapons like machine guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:36| and silencers and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| it would put traditional firearms that people own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10359)|
| 2:52:44| the Glock pistol that my colleague here carries for his work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10364)|
| 2:52:49| it would put those type of normal, everyday firearms under a greater restriction even than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10369)|
| 2:52:56| you know, than firearms that are restricted through the National Firearms Act passed in the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10376)|
| 2:53:03| In fact, it would infringe upon a person's rights so greatly that it would make firearms ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10383)|
| 2:53:12| or at least semi-automatic firearms ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10392)|
| 2:53:16| so economically restrictive that it would delegate it only to the wealthy and only to the privileged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10396)|
| 2:53:23| And the Second Amendment of our Constitution was put there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| It was put there because we are not a society of privilege and class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:31| where the nobles have certain rights that the commoners don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10411)|
| 2:53:36| We're a society where all folks are looked at as equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10416)|
| 2:53:40| And when you put economic barriers like licensing and fees as a prerequisite to firearms ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10420)|
| 2:53:49| you get away from being a classless society to being a classed society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10429)|
| 2:53:55| where only the wealthy and the elites are capable of owning firearms to hunt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10435)|
| 2:54:02| firearms to defend their life with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| And if this passes in the House, I certainly fear that we have a president that would sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10446)|
| 2:54:13| And so I think that we need to stand together as a community and say in a very loud voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10453)|
| 2:54:19| we are not interested in gun control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10459)|
| 2:54:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| I guess I'm just trying to, in looking at the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| I'm trying to figure out how this is going to turn our gun ownership to the rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10472)|
| 2:54:41| I don't see any dollars associated with this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| I see you have to register it, but that's the only fee that I see associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10487)|
| 2:54:55| And then my second question is, I think fully automatic or things where you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10495)|
| 2:55:03| Fully automatic weapons are already heavily regulated by the United States government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10503)|
| 2:55:08| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| And you tried, I think you were making an attempt to, hold on, let me finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10509)|
| 2:55:15| that you were trying to make an attempt to parallel the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| to try to put what this legislation would do on equal footing with fully automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10520)|
| 2:55:26| And I think there's a huge chasm between what it would take to get a fully automatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10526)|
| 2:55:34| than just registering with the local authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10534)|
| 2:55:38| Sir, fully automatic weapons are already registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| Very few people own them because they're already registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| Now, I've been through that red tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| I happen to own two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| And I understand how restrictive it is when you have to go through a licensing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10549)|
| 2:56:01| And I do believe that the NFA Act of the 30s was passed with good reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10561)|
| 2:56:08| and I believe that it's done its job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10568)|
| 2:56:11| But I don't believe that standard semi-automatic firearms, sporting arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10571)|
| 2:56:17| pistols that are used for self-defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10577)|
| 2:56:20| I don't believe they should be put under the same restrictions as a machine gun would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10580)|
| 2:56:26| And essentially, HR 45 would put the same type of restrictions on traditional firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10586)|
| 2:56:34| I guess that last statement is where I disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| and I don't think this will put, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10597)|
| 2:56:42| SIG 38 on par with a fully automatic weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10602)|
| 2:56:46| So I don't want to belabor that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| I mean, I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| I mean, right now you can buy a SIG pistol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| I don't believe Commissioner Lambert's been recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10614)|
| 2:56:57| Well, he's asking him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| He's asking me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10619)|
| 2:57:00| I'm saying that a SIG handgun, the fact that it has a magazine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:07| or is capable of accepting a magazine that will hold greater than 10 rounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| right now there are very few restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10632)|
| 2:57:15| Basically, if you don't have a criminal record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10635)|
| 2:57:18| and if you've not been deemed mentally deficient, you're allowed to buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| A fully automatic weapon must be registered with the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| It takes three months to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| And I'm not sure in the 30s if they realized quite what they were doing either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10649)|
| 2:57:34| but it's a $200 transfer tax to place that registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10654)|
| 2:57:39| My theory is that if you start registering firearms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10659)|
| 2:57:42| that you're going to have common folks that just aren't going to go to the trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| and that you're also going to have a government that's going to come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| we have to provide people to register these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| so we need to accept a fee because of this registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10675)|
| 2:58:00| So what it essentially will do is treat traditional firearms like we treat exotic firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10680)|
| 2:58:05| It would, in fact, make that SIG pistol into an exotic firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10685)|
| 2:58:12| Are you finished, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| Anyone who wants to read about this bill can do so online at the Library of Congress' site, Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10699)|
| 2:58:25| And I really don't want to get into an argument about the relative merits or demerits of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| It's a federal piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| It's kind of a write your congressman kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10713)|
| 2:58:37| What I'm wondering is why is this before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| There is no unique local angle on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| The effects in Knoxville, positive or negative, are the same as in Chattanooga, Raleigh, Portland, or Cedar Rapids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10724)|
| 2:58:51| We've occasionally dealt with national or international issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| but almost always in the context of some local angle, such as where we invest our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10734)|
| 2:58:59| or whether it reduces our franchise fees or stimulus money or something along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10739)|
| 2:59:04| where there's a direct quantifiable difference in something that directly affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10744)|
| 2:59:09| This is a write your congressman thing, whether you like H.R. 45 or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10749)|
| 2:59:14| And I don't think it's properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| In a community that's twice been ravaged by gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| maybe we should leave this to the individual members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| to decide whether they think this bill is a good idea or a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10763)|
| 2:59:28| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| First, I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| Can we have discussion on something before it's been moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10772)|
| 2:59:36| That's been moved a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| We can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| Fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10780)|
| 2:59:41| I'm sorry, my confusion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| But I do want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10783)|
| 2:59:44| We can have discussion before people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| Right, but has this already been moved and seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10787)|
| 2:59:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| It has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| I'll go ahead and make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10795)|
| 2:59:58| We had a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10798)|
| 3:00:01| Or maybe we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| You can do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10803)|
| 3:00:04| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| He didn't make one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10805)|
| 3:00:06| You can do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| Okay, I'll just say that I agree with Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| that this is not something that needs to come before a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| This is indeed a write your congressman issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| That's where they're going to be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| And as someone whose family was recently shot at by a regular everyday firearm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10822)|
| 3:00:28| I have to say that if they had required regulation or licensing or registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10828)|
| 3:00:34| two of my friends who are dead might be alive right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10834)|
| 3:00:37| So I'm not in favor of strict gun control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| but I am in favor of some type of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| But, again, this is an argument for you and I to have at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10843)|
| 3:00:48| Lumpy, this isn't something that needs to come before commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| Commissioner Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| I fully understand being a victim of gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10855)|
| 3:01:00| I have been a victim of gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10860)|
| 3:01:05| I had a young man put a pistol in my face with every intention to kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10865)|
| 3:01:10| He told officers later that his intention was to kidnap me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10870)|
| 3:01:14| his intention was to take me to a field in a car that he had stolen from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10874)|
| 3:01:19| and his intention was to shoot me and kill me and leave me for dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| So I fully understand gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10884)|
| 3:01:27| I was in a mall and witnessed close hand right there within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10887)|
| 3:01:32| I mean, I could hear the shell casings hit the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10892)|
| 3:01:35| So I understand gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10895)|
| 3:01:38| Gun violence has to do with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| It has to do with violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| It doesn't have to do with guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10902)|
| 3:01:46| Had I not had a gun that day, I would not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10906)|
| 3:01:51| The gun was not the thing that intended to do violent act to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10911)|
| 3:01:58| That young man's gun that's sitting in the evidence locker is just a hunk of metal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10918)|
| 3:02:03| capable of no thought of its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10923)|
| 3:02:06| It was the young man that intended to kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| And had I not had my own gun, I would be dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| Again, Lumpy, this is an argument for you and I to have at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10933)|
| 3:02:17| This is something that's improperly before commission, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| Are you finished, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10943)|
| 3:02:26| The motion on the floor is to accept or approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10950)|
| 3:02:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10952)|
| 3:02:33| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10953)|
| 3:02:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10954)|

| 3:03:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=10992)|

| 3:03:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| Oh, shit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11008)|
| 3:03:29| What's the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| Here it says that the Board of Commissioners expresses its opposition to the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11014)|
| 3:03:41| Is there any way that we could put words in here that either describe on a split vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11021)|
| 3:03:47| or calls out to say me specifically voted no on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11027)|
| 3:03:53| I guess that's a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| It's a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11036)|
| 3:03:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11039)|
| 3:04:02| This body expresses its will by majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11042)|
| 3:04:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11045)|
| 3:04:06| The motion passes 12-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11046)|
| 3:04:10| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| I want to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11053)|
| 3:04:14| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11054)|
| 3:04:15| We need to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11055)|
| 3:04:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11056)|
| 3:04:17| Mr. Chair, we need to go back to 907, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11057)|
| 3:04:23| We want to make sure that you're appointed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| You are not listed as no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| It's just as one commissioner does not say Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| So, as of right now, only Commissioner Carringer is on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| And I would like to make sure that your wishes are considered and that you're on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11076)|
| 3:04:42| I'd like to take a vote to reconsider item number 907,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11082)|
| 3:04:47| since I was on the prevailing side with everybody else, to reconsider 907| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| so that we can then go back, have her added to that resolution, and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11091)|
| 3:04:56| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11096)|
| 3:04:57| We have a motion to reconsider 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11099)|
| 3:05:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11100)|
| 3:05:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11101)|
| 3:05:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11102)|
| 3:05:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11103)|
| 3:05:04| I'd like to make a motion that we approve 907 with both Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| and Amy Broyles as being the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11111)|
| 3:05:12| Motion to add the name of Amy Broyles along with Commissioner Carringer to 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11112)|
| 3:05:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11120)|
| 3:05:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11121)|
| 3:05:22| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11127)|
| 3:05:30| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| amending the Knox County Code of Ethics to provide for a new section entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11133)|
| 3:05:37| Whistleblower Protection and renumbering the current sections six and seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11137)|
| 3:05:43| as sections seven and eight previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| Resolution 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11146)|

| 3:05:50| 908-10-0 to approve with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11150)|
| 3:05:53| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11153)|
| 3:05:54| 7-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11159)|
| 3:06:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| Commissioner, who took it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11162)|
| 3:06:04| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11164)|
| 3:06:05| I want to commend Commissioner Briggs and the Ethics Committee for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| I think this is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| My question is, Commissioner, was there any discussion at the Ethics Committee on how to get the word out to employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11169)|
| 3:06:15| that this policy was indeed in effect, how it would work, maybe a phone number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11175)|
| 3:06:19| maybe putting up posters or submitting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| I'm just wondering how we get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| I think what we should do is to do it similar to what the mandatory postings they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11183)|
| 3:06:30| like for the equal opportunity people where it has to be posted on every bulletin board in every department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| so people know, employees know they have the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11195)|
| 3:06:39| And I believe, and the law director can help me with this, is that they go to your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11199)|
| 3:06:45| they have to file a sworn statement, and then that statement is kept confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11205)|
| 3:06:50| Is that how we decided to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11210)|
| 3:06:53| On the whistleblower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11213)|
| 3:06:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| The way it works is it's very short and it's attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11215)|
| 3:07:01| And it is not confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11221)|
| 3:07:08| That was part of the discussion as to whether or not it would remain confidential or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11228)|
| 3:07:14| and the Ethics Committee decided that since there was the requirement for a complaint to be deemed credible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11234)|
| 3:07:24| that someone had to sign it and that it had to be under oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11244)|
| 3:07:30| there was a fear and there was a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11250)|
| 3:07:35| But the majority view was that in order to attempt to ensure against frivolous complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11255)|
| 3:07:44| or complaints that might be lodged as harassment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11264)|
| 3:07:48| that a person who came forward would have to sign a complaint under oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11268)|
| 3:07:57| but in the hope that the whistleblower protection itself would allow them the latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11277)|
| 3:08:07| and provide them the courage to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| Because they don't have those protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| Now, I know we talked about several options, and I couldn't remember what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11294)|
| 3:08:17| but they do have to make a sworn statement that they sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11297)|
| 3:08:21| What I would suggest that we do is have the Human Resources Department print some cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11301)|
| 3:08:28| like we do for EEO and some of these others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| and have them place those on the same public bulletin boards that are in full view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11311)|
| 3:08:36| and then employees will know what their rights and protections are under this whistleblower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11316)|
| 3:08:42| The ethics policy is currently on the website, and if you approve this, this amends the ethics policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11322)|
| 3:08:51| and becomes part and parcel of the ethics policy, which is on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11331)|
| 3:08:57| I agree with you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| Perhaps it would be in line to do an intranet, something circulated to all county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11339)|
| 3:09:06| announcing the fact that this whistleblower protection has been adopted to make everyone aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11346)|
| 3:09:14| and then directing them to a link on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| I think the most important aspect of this is that they be made aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11358)|
| 3:09:23| and it's not something that it's there, but it's hidden in a long ethics policy under some subparagraph somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11363)|
| 3:09:31| but they need to know that that is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11371)|
| 3:09:34| Should we make that part of this, that we instruct the, or will they just do it automatically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11374)|
| 3:09:40| Well, it will be included as a part of the ethics policy automatically, and it will be on the website automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11380)|
| 3:09:48| I don't think it would be automatic that there would be an email sent out to all county employees alerting them to that fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11388)|
| 3:09:57| so I think it would certainly be appropriate for that to be part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11397)|
| 3:10:02| I'll make an amendment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11402)|
| 3:10:05| If Mr. Briggs would be agreeable that we instruct the human resources to send out notification that we do have this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11405)|
| 3:10:12| and that it is in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11412)|
| 3:10:13| And make it whatever the method is that they decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| It's something that really does get to people so they hear about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| and it's not buried in some obscure paper or something that comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11420)|
| 3:10:27| but it needs to be, people need to be aware that it's available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11427)|
| 3:10:34| Did I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11436)|
| 3:10:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11437)|
| 3:10:38| I didn't know if that was just amending the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11438)|
| 3:10:43| So all you would need is the maker and the secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11443)|
| 3:10:47| We already have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| Well, if the maker of the motion would accept a friendly amendment that we add that language that the human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11449)|
| 3:10:54| will send it out on intranet to all employees, letting them know we do have the policy in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11454)|
| 3:10:58| Tony, do you accept the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11458)|
| 3:11:01| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11461)|
| 3:11:06| Yeah, you made it when you said intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| Oh, because of intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| Yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| Commissioner Burroughs, where did she go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| She left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11476)|
| 3:11:21| She made two with a second to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11481)|
| 3:11:25| Do you accept the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| Just say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11487)|
| 3:11:28| Yes, say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| Do you accept the amendment to put the whistleblower notice on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11489)|
| 3:11:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11493)|
| 3:11:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11494)|
| 3:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11495)|
| 3:11:36| Do you have something, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11496)|
| 3:11:38| Yes, and I definitely support this, but I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11498)|
| 3:11:45| has the legal department or human resources considered financial implications of this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| And if so, is it going to adversely affect the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11510)|
| 3:11:57| I mean, this isn't a small task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11517)|
| 3:12:00| I mean, once they declare themselves, there are certain things that must be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| and I'm sure it's going to take resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11526)|
| 3:12:08| I'll just make a comment that probably most of the things that are reported will end up saving the county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11528)|
| 3:12:13| or making the county money, so it's probably got rather than a negative financial impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11533)|
| 3:12:17| it may have a positive financial impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| Well, when you have a whistleblower program, I mean, there may be something that's going to come out the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11539)|
| 3:12:24| It may not be issues of theft and mismanagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11544)|
| 3:12:29| It may be personal-type issues as well, harassment and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11549)|
| 3:12:34| So I'm just wondering, have we considered that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| And, again, I'm not ñ I support the notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| So I just want to make sure that we're not, you know, next year this time we're having to add HR staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11561)|
| 3:12:46| or law departments having to add an extra clerk or a person as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11566)|
| 3:12:52| There was a discussion, and Commissioner Briggs can also attest to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11572)|
| 3:12:57| there was a discussion by the Ethics Committee as to a way to accomplish this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11577)|
| 3:13:02| without doing exactly what you're talking about, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11582)|
| 3:13:09| The way this policy operates, you can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| It puts into place a new Section 6 in the ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11592)|
| 3:13:17| and if there is an allegation made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11597)|
| 3:13:23| then this sets in place a policy that would only trigger the other sanctions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11603)|
| 3:13:32| that are currently available under the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11612)|
| 3:13:41| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| Yeah, I just want to say in response to Mr. McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11623)|
| 3:13:48| if we've got such problems in Knox County that we're going to have to hire extra staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11628)|
| 3:13:53| to hear the whistleblower complaints, then we need this more than I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11633)|
| 3:13:59| Two years ago, no one knew a lot was going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11642)|
| 3:14:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11647)|
| 3:14:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:09| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| 9-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11652)|
| 3:14:13| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| amending the Knox County Commission rules to allow items to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11656)|
| 3:14:19| at the regular Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11663)|
| 3:14:24| Approved by the Rules Committee to send it on to recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11664)|
| 3:14:28| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11668)|
| 3:14:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11669)|
| 3:14:30| Property moved and seconded to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11670)|
| 3:14:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11672)|
| 3:14:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11673)|
| 3:14:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11674)|
| 3:14:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11675)|
| 3:14:36| We have a loose sheet, 9-13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| This is consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| approving an agreement of sale in the amount of $2,000 with Joy Whitehead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11684)|
| 3:14:48| for property located on Terry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11688)|
| 3:14:51| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11691)|
| 3:14:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11692)|
| 3:14:57| This is a little small strip of property that was discussed earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11697)|
| 3:15:02| that joins two family-owned pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11702)|
| 3:15:06| and it was basically an easement is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11706)|
| 3:15:09| probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-plus feet wide by 300 feet long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| as a strip easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| and they're wanting to join this piece back together as a whole piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| I think the history was given last time under this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11720)|
| 3:15:23| that it was no longer of any use to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:26| and we approved by consent the negotiation and sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11726)|
| 3:15:30| and purchasing has arrived at the $2,000 figure that's before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11730)|
| 3:15:35| I just wanted to present this so that we could vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| and these people could get on with a uniform piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| All of this is related in our consent item R09, is it 3801?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11741)|
| 3:15:49| 3801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11749)|
| 3:15:50| Where the map is if you wanted to see a pictorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| Can I make a motion that we accept this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| And I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11760)|
| 3:16:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11763)|
| 3:16:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11764)|
| 3:16:05| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| We're going to have the law director start our discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11767)|
| 3:16:12| He wants to discuss 910 and talk about something about 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11772)|
| 3:16:17| We have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11777)|
| 3:16:28| We're going to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11788)|
| 3:16:29| We have one more resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11789)|
| 3:16:34| Not drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| Do you want to discuss it, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| Yeah, I just had some people come up and wanted to talk about the fee office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11797)|
| 3:16:44| and requested that I request data from all the fee offices in regards to the satellite office visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11804)|
| 3:16:52| and I just want a resolution asking the fee offices to turn over satellite visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11812)|
| 3:16:57| and statistics for the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11817)|
| 3:17:02| Someone want to second his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11822)|
| 3:17:04| I'll second, and I've got something to add to it if you're okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11824)|
| 3:17:11| In the request, ask the fee officers to explore the possibility of cross-training their employees in the satellite offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11831)|
| 3:17:20| so that a register person could fill in for a trustee person when they go to lunch or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11840)|
| 3:17:27| Just explore the possibility of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11847)|
| 3:17:34| And it just popped into my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11854)|
| 3:17:36| I would like to wait on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| You've got separately elected offices, and I want to keep them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11858)|
| 3:17:43| I would prefer it just be statistics for office visits right now until we see the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11863)|
| 3:17:47| I'll second, and I'll bring that up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| Commissioner Nauman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11870)|
| 3:17:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11872)|
| 3:17:53| Mr. Anders, what you're asking for is numbers of visits, numbers of transactions, how much fees are being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11873)|
| 3:18:04| How much use is each facility getting in regards to is it efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11884)|
| 3:18:08| or is it something that we can look at as a potential budget recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11888)|
| 3:18:13| Okay, are any of the people that are more familiar with the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11893)|
| 3:18:17| would there be other, while we're at it, other sources of information that might be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11897)|
| 3:18:22| besides just numbers of transactions, number of visits, that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11902)|
| 3:18:27| Is there anybody else here that would like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11907)|
| 3:18:31| I think that's very good, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| I think it's just a use situation now, and if we can be more efficient next year with the fee office satellites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11913)|
| 3:18:39| I think that's something we've got to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| We're paying rent and utilities at all these facilities, but they're not being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11921)|
| 3:18:44| We need to look at cutting them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11924)|
| 3:18:47| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| Yeah, I'm going to be recusing myself of the discussion and voting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11929)|
| 3:18:56| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11938)|
| 3:19:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11941)|
| 3:19:02| My recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11942)|
| 3:19:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11943)|
| 3:19:04| Eighteen, zero, and one, recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11944)|
| 3:19:11| I'm going to turn it over to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11951)|
| 3:19:17| You can take a break, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11957)|
| 3:19:20| Where are you going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| I've been here since 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11962)|
| 3:19:23| Take a full week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:27| One o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11967)|
| 3:19:28| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11968)|
| 3:19:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| I'm going to have a 30-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| I'm going to get a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11971)|
| 3:19:34| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11974)|
| 3:19:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:36| We're here for a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11976)|
| 3:19:39| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11979)|
| 3:19:40| Break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11980)|
| 3:19:53| Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| I appreciate this opportunity to present the results of the research that my office has been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=11995)|
| 3:20:02| on the memorandum and proposed resolution and proposed ordinance submitted by Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12002)|
| 3:20:12| And before I go any further, let me state that from my perspective and the perspective of my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12012)|
| 3:20:20| this is purely a legal issue, nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12020)|
| 3:20:24| And the opinions that will be expressed today, I hope we will support to your satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12024)|
| 3:20:39| I'll start with the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12039)|
| 3:20:41| In 1977, a limited constitutional convention took place in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12041)|
| 3:20:48| and that constitutional convention proposed amendments to the Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12048)|
| 3:20:55| that resulted in Article 7, Section 1, that allowed counties to adopt a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12055)|
| 3:21:02| which is sometimes referred to as home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12062)|
| 3:21:04| You have before you the first and third paragraph of Article 7, Section 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12064)|
| 3:21:14| The first paragraph of Article 7, Section 1 discusses what are sometimes referred to as constitutional officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12074)|
| 3:21:25| and you see them named there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| The third paragraph in Article 7, Section 1, I skipped the second paragraph, but you see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12087)|
| 3:21:38| The second bullet point says the General Assembly may provide alternate forms of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12098)|
| 3:21:44| including the right to charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12104)|
| 3:21:48| As a result of the constitutional amendment, which was adopted by the voters of the state of Tennessee in 1978,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12108)|
| 3:21:57| the Tennessee legislature enacted enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12117)|
| 3:22:08| Now, let me draw your attention to this particular provision of that enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12128)|
| 3:22:16| The amendments to the Constitution that allow the charter form of government were not self-executing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12136)|
| 3:22:23| meaning that the legislature had to pass laws that specified how it would be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12143)|
| 3:22:29| and what the requirements were for it to be done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12149)|
| 3:22:38| This is part of that enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| Tennessee code annotated Section 51202A, and this, of course, was quoted by the Tennessee Supreme Court in Jordan v. Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12162)|
| 3:22:57| So what you see before you is not only the enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12177)|
| 3:23:03| but it's part and parcel of the discussion by the Tennessee Supreme Court in Jordan v. Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12183)|
| 3:23:12| As you can see, the legislature stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12192)|
| 3:23:15| no right, power, duty, obligation, or function of any officer, agency, or office of such county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12195)|
| 3:23:23| shall be retained and continued unless the enabling act itself or the charter of such county expressly so provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12203)|
| 3:23:36| So the enabling legislation provides options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:43| The enabling legislation passed by the General Assembly says that a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12223)|
| 3:23:50| when it adopts a charter form of government, has a great deal of latitude in what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12230)|
| 3:23:57| It can continue offices that are already in existence if it complies with the other aspects of the enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12237)|
| 3:24:10| or it can create new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| The county has that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12253)|
| 3:24:21| Now, in the Bailey decision by the Tennessee Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12261)|
| 3:24:30| and that's the case that began in Shelby County, the other charter county in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12270)|
| 3:24:38| the Supreme Court said that the enabling statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:44| be liberally construed as a utilization of the constitutional power granted by Article 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12284)|
| 3:24:59| Because the statute permits a county charter to prescribe the qualifications of other elected county officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12299)|
| 3:25:10| and what they were referring to, other elected officials in Jordan, was the constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12310)|
| 3:25:19| You have to remember that in the Bailey case that started in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| the only offices that were in issue, the only offices that the Supreme Court was addressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12323)|
| 3:25:30| was the county legislative body in Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12330)|
| 3:25:38| That's all they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12338)|
| 3:25:41| Jordan, of course, was construing the term limits provision in the Knox County Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12341)|
| 3:25:50| and the language in the term limits provision in the Knox County Charter said all elected offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12350)|
| 3:26:02| That's what our term limits provision says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12362)|
| 3:26:06| It's not limited to the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12366)|
| 3:26:09| By its express provision, it applies to any elected official in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12369)|
| 3:26:17| That's what the wording says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12377)|
| 3:26:21| What the Tennessee Supreme Court said in Jordan was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12381)|
| 3:26:28| again, focusing on this issue of all elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12388)|
| 3:26:37| because that is the language that was chosen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12397)|
| 3:26:43| the 1994 referendum that adopted term limits in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12403)|
| 3:26:48| demonstrated the intent to limit the terms of county officials to the extent possible under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12408)|
| 3:26:58| Let's discuss that a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12418)|
| 3:27:04| The Supreme Court went on to say that those term limits then would apply not just to county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12424)|
| 3:27:12| but that same restriction applies to those other county officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12432)|
| 3:27:17| identified in the state constitution under Article 7, Section 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12437)|
| 3:27:25| Now, if you'll remember that first slide that talked about Article 7, Section 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12445)|
| 3:27:33| what were those county officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| Those county officers that were identified were the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12456)|
| 3:27:43| the registrar of deeds, the sheriff, the attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12463)|
| 3:27:49| were the property assessor, the registrar of deeds, the sheriff, the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12469)|
| 3:27:57| So the term limits, according to the Supreme Court, applied to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12477)|
| 3:28:03| even though they're constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12483)|
| 3:28:07| There was a debate that had gone on for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| In fact, that's one of the reasons that the 1994 term limits provision was never applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12490)|
| 3:28:16| because in this state at least, and the attorney general issued an advisory opinion to this effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12496)|
| 3:28:23| it said that constitutional officers, officers created or recognized by the state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12503)|
| 3:28:30| could not be term limited by local option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12510)|
| 3:28:33| The Supreme Court said that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12513)|
| 3:28:36| It said since those officers are described in Article 7, Section 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:46| and since Article 7, Section 1 is the same constitutional provision that empowers the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12526)|
| 3:28:54| to pass the enabling legislation, they could be limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12534)|
| 3:28:59| Now, there were several other elected officials in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| even though the language in the term limits provision says that it applies to all elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12542)|
| 3:29:09| the Supreme Court in Jordan said we're not going to apply it to all elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12549)|
| 3:29:14| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| Well, because some of them aren't created by Article 7, Section 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12556)|
| 3:29:22| Some of them are created by Article 6 of our constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12562)|
| 3:29:28| And in the enabling legislation itself, it creates exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12568)|
| 3:29:32| It says that you can't apply it to judicial officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12572)|
| 3:29:38| So that takes out the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| That takes out the clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12580)|
| 3:29:46| There are the district attorney general, as recognized by Jordan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12586)|
| 3:29:52| while holding an elected office in Knox County, is a state official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12592)|
| 3:29:57| So the term limits provision does not apply to the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part1?start=12597)|
