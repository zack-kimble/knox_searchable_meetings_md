| 1:57:50| after the expo forum that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| KUV held, I actually went to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| lunch with our counterparts at Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| I ended up asking them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| what do you think about KUV fiber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Their answer was, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| bad for them. That's what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| going to show tonight, is how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| it affects the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Why would anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| want municipal fiber? Well, for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| KUV is a local utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| As one of the previous people stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| going to wait more than a couple hours for KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| to come out and fix their power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| I've been without internet for multiple weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| due to Comcast in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| I know that KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| actually has my best interest at heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| and if they don't, we have the power to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| elect the people that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| On additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| right now, I know there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| been proposals over the years for Knoxville to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| a technology corridor, specifically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| Pellissippi area on Heart Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| We can't do that. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| just isn't the internet service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| available in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| for us to do that. All the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| companies are moving to Chattanooga. I got a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| offer recently for a company in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| The reason they're based there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| EPB. The answer is simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| When I was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| looking for my housing recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| sorry if my speech isn't very structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| I was only looking for places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| that actually had fiber service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| Specifically, I was looking for AT&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| because it's the best that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| KUV's proposal is actually cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| than AT&T's and better in every way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| When I was looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| I was forced to settle for Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| for me, working from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| internet is my livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| Where I live, where my tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| dollars go, all depends upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| ISP available to me at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| For me, right now, even though I'm on Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| I have fiber. It is some of the worst service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| that you could ever imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| Architecturally speaking, it's terrible as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| I actually have to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| about how I do my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| Previously, when I had symmetrical fiber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| I could say, oh, it doesn't really matter how I do my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| I can do upload and download all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| A lot of what the data scientists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| I've been speaking here to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| That also affects me and my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| One thing I do want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| is I hope KUV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| with this proposal, will actually align themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| with net neutrality. It's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| all the big ISPs, Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| Charter, WOW, everyone out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| including AT2. None of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| are aligned with net neutrality. Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| during the pandemic, they said, hey, we're going to waive our data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| caps for everyone. That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Did their network experience any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| performance segregation? The answer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| no. The public has stated that. They've reinstituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| data caps and they've rolled that out to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| markets. KUV's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| proposal has no data caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| It's cheaper than my service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| even with the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| power rate increase for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| It's cheaper. It's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| It's going to be more reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| As I stated earlier, KUV has my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| interest at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| For my closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| on it, I just want to vote in favor of the KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| proposal. We cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| delay this vote. Someone else is stating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| but simply delaying the vote is going to kill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| the proposal. We already have the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| community out here. Everyone stood up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| to show who is in favor for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| We are over three-quarters of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| You have a binder with everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| proposals for what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| Today's world, the freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| of information comes at the speed of light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| Let's bring the speed of light to Knoxville. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| Thank you, Mr. Kirkland. Next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| standing up to speak is Brady Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| Mr. Watson, if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| come to the podium, state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| address for the record. You have up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7296)|
| 2:01:45| Hello there. Good evening, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| Brady Watson here, 229 Haywood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| Avenue. I'm here as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| resident of Knoxville and also a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| As many of you know, SACE is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| Knoxville-based nonprofit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| that promotes responsible and equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| energy choices to ensure clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| safe, and healthy communities throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| Southeast, including here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| where we often engage with issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| related to KUV. And as many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| of you also know, in recent years, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| offered some pointed feedback for KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| and their policies, but tonight I'd actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| like to offer a statement of support for KUV's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| proposed broadband proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Now, some of you may be wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| what does broadband have to do with energy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Well, municipal broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| and the fiber infrastructure that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| along with it offers many potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| benefits, both environmental and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| social, for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| First of all, the build-out of fiber infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| that will allow KUV to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| to offer broadband services will also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| greatly improve the reliability of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| the electric grid. We need to look no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| further than our neighbors to the south in Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| at EPB, who have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7367)|

| 2:03:05| relaying of information, better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| connectivity, and fewer maintenance trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7387)|

| 2:03:11| address service issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| Those fewer outages mean better experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| for customers, including the opportunity to integrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| smart grid technologies, such as programmable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7397)|

| 2:03:23| that results in lower carbon emissions as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| of fewer deployments for KEB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7405)|

| 2:03:29| Second, the social benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| of investing in municipal broadband are numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| as well. The COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| pandemic has shown, in stark contrast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| as we've all seen, that we as a society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| have become increasingly reliant on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| reliable high-speed internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| and many in our community, especially low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| people and communities of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| lack access to that reliable high-speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| internet. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| according to the study that was recently mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| by the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| gentleman over there, there are more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| 30,000 households in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| that do not have an internet connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| and that's frankly unacceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| in my opinion. It leads to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| digital divide that makes existing disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| even worse and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| pronounced as students who need more reliable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| internet access to complete assignments and homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| fall behind their peers with more consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| access, and same goes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| adults. Many find themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| struggling to work from home, pay bills, and access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| information without that access. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| by offering reliable high-speed internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| we believe KEB can begin to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| that digital divide and help decrease some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| disparities that do exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| Thirdly, municipal broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| offers real economic benefits, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| KEB's proposal would add around 200 local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| jobs, and they're good-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| The fiber installers and technicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| they said would earn a base rate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| $55,000. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| good money. Those jobs would catalyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| our local economy and provide an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| opportunity, especially for our young folks who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| faced with a number of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| in our community, and can provide them with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| opportunities to attain good-paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| jobs without the need for a college degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| Other possible benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| according to that same UT study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| include small firm growth, 1%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| increase in the region's GDP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| and a roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| 25% reduction in job search time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| for unemployed individuals. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| that's especially important as we come through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| Of course, there are concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| and things we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| aware of, and the rollout of this program must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| be done in an equitable manner that ensures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| access to households that need it most, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| as we know, there are already many tens of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| thousands of households that don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| access. So I've been encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| that KEB has taken the initial steps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| ensure this by offering a low-income Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| program, and we'll look forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| further details regarding that, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| certainly be following that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| Now, of course, that I've outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| the benefits of broadband, I want to just touch on a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| of the topics regarding rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| and fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| According to KEB, the average customer will see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| around a $10 increase in their monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| bill after all three electric rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| take effect over the next three-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| period, but subsequent increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| would not be expected for at least another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| seven years. It's also important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| to note, in our opinion, that the rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| being proposed to help pay for that fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| infrastructure are based on usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| and not fixed fees. It's a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| equitable solution, as fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| are felt most by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| low-income families who can be charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| up to $85 per month if they receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| all four KEB services even before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| turning on a light or using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| a drop of water. So rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| on usage fees can actually help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| conserve energy by sending the correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| market signals and encouraging high-energy users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| to consume less as their bills go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| Now, all that being said, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| talked a bit about the push to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| I would like to encourage you not to delay a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| on this proposal. It's going to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| all Knoxvillians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7605)|

| 2:06:49| their paid lobbyists are pushing for that delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| You're five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7611)|

| 2:06:55| Like I said, I hope you'll consider this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| and not delay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7617)|

| 2:07:43| have had a lot of good phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| calls with AT&T and Comcast over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| I've been on the receiving end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| terrible customer service on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| behalf of clients and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| residents, just people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| You know, you end up getting on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| with somebody and it's not even a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| person. You're talking to a robot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| and the robot's like asking you what your intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| are and trying to interpret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| I just say this because I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| just kind of bring to light some of the things that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| go through. And I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| you know, probably nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| knows what a data cap is, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| you're only allowed to download so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| information at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| And so like if you watch a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| Netflix or if you do a lot of Zoom calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| you may not be, you may hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| that data cap really fast. So I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| just mention that. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| this is so important for Knoxville. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| I'm from Knoxville. I went to Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| and went to UT. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| I've been wanting this since Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| got it in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| about Chattanooga, I looked it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| and there's a Cities Today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| report they did. They found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| that it's returned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| social benefits worth over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| $2.69 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| in the first decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| I mean, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| built a city-owned utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| and they advanced their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| smart grid. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| they've got the fastest internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| that you can get. It's the gig city. Now it's the 10 gig city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| So I would love to catch up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| But it's not just Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| It's also Lenore City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| Morristown, Newport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| and now Dandridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| is rolling out fiber networks. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| we've got to catch up or we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| start emerging people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| So these little towns have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| faster internet than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| And that just doesn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| So I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| to just say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| with Comcast, you know, we don't really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| any sort of guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| that they'll do what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| So I've heard discussion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| some promises being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| But Comcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| is not known to be a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| that necessarily lives up to the promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| that it makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| So there have been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| they say they'll be there between 8 and 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| tomorrow morning and you hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| for the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| I'm in-house. I see people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| and they'll have maybe one or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| two options for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| internet. I've never seen any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| options more than that. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| it's a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| I would love to see there be a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| option for broadband in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| I don't want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| us stick around with a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| that has a lower customer service rating than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| So I wanted to thank you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| for your time and we need to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| on this. As people have already said, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| funding that's on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| that we need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| it happens. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| I have asked some friends of mine to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| today and to wear yellow to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| show their support. So there are a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| people here in the crowd. I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| ask everybody to step up again, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| it's been really inspiring to see people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| show out in yellow today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| to support fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| internet for Knoxville. Fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| is super important. Yellow means new beginnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| it means happiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| and it means friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| So here's to new beginnings with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| friendship that brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| us happiness. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| Thank you Mr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| The next person signed up to speak is Kent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| Manotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| You signed up for that item as well. You don't have to speak to this one if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7887)|
| 2:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7899)|

| 2:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| You can start by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| saying your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| I'm Jennifer Morris. I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7927)|

| 2:12:11| Road. It's in Lenore City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| However, I own two residences under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| the KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7935)|

| 2:12:53| Zero luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| I have been told by private companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| you're out of luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| I am 2.5 miles from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7979)|

| 2:13:03| I am 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7983)|

| 2:13:13| and I talk and she gives me a lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| or somebody to talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| I'm calling them, saying, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| there's some money here, there's some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| here, let's get some fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| to my area. I have 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| homes that could have fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| run airily for under $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| and no one will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| anything. AT&T has told me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| forget it. I will never have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| They have also received tens of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| millions of dollars to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| provide a wireless service to our house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| that does not work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| at my house. So the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| I'm telling you this is because I'm an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| advocate for utility internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| I have started a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| in my area called CUT, Citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| Underserved in Technology. I'm also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Knox County educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| So I have a little bit of perspective on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| this problem and the first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| that everyone on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| board and council needs to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| is that homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| need fiber internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| and it has to be high quality fiber internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| I have heard numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| oh, we'll run a wireless service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| to your house and that will be your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| internet. Broadband is a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| wide definition through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| the FCC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| and everyone needs fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| internet in this day and age. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| pandemic has brought that to the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| but we pay $212| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| a month for via sat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| internet and I have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| clocked on my phone 0.36| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| download| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| speed, megabytes per second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| download speed. You can't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| like that. The only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| option for people today needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| to be fiber internet. I talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| educators I work with and I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| please do not give midnight deadlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| to these children. They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| So these kids who don't have good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| broadband or good fiber internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| cannot do their assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| I wrote an analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| based on my perspective on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| and I'm trying to talk to LCUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| into doing it in our area. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| KUB serves seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| almost 500,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| so there's a lot of people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| your service area like me that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| haven't gone to the links that I have gone to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| I have gone to numerous links| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| and literally I have gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| nowhere because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| AT&T who is my footprint provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| will not do anything and no other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| private provider will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| anything for us. We are hopeful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| that LCUV will get into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| ballgame and it looks like they're probably going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| to. Utility borne internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| is the only way to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| this day and age. We all need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| fiber and it needs to be high quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| and it needs to be consistent for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| everyone. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| really why I'm here is to just share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| that because if we sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| for two or three more years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| I have followed almost $2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| billion of state and federal funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| that has gone to private providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| under $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| could save 100 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| two miles from fiber. They will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| not do it. They have told me forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| about it. I filed FCC complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| I've done everything. The other thing I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| to say is Elon Musk's Starlink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| program that's supposed to be doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| low latency satellite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| that's supposed to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| In March he filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| with the FCC to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| his satellites on every moving vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| in the United States. He's getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| hundreds of millions of dollars right now from the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| government to serve the underserved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| you all need to be getting that money because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| he's doing it for moving vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| So the purpose of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| is to say fiber is the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| to go and the only way everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| going to get it is through utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| One last thing. Everyone in here needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| to understand the 1936| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| Rural Electrification Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| which is kind of what we're going through now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| with broadband or I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| recall broadband fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| It saved rural America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| It saved rural America and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| where we're at. Rural America cannot survive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| without quality fiber and the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| companies won't do it. So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8227)|

| 2:18:51| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| we've done programming like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| on this for years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| there are four points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| I'd like to make. First is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| the way to solve the digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| divide is to focus on, to fill the gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| as you said, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| What I've seen through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| work and in my prior work as one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| people who ran the agencies that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| gives the money out to close the digital divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| is if you don't get it in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| they're just going to overbuild the affluent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| Four out of five dollars that were designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| to go fill the gaps on digital divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| get spent covering affluent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| It's like saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| you're going to solve kids' nutrition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| and food deserts by building more Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| in the rich parts of town. So, rule number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| make sure you get it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| You could just stay speaking into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| Oh, sorry about that. Rule number two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| is I think you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| a more complete economic analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| Professor Kessler's report is fascinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| He talks about how if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| save money on broadband, you get to spend it elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| in your community and there's a multiplier effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| What his report doesn't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| is it doesn't look at the cost of the build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| His analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| assumes that the build-out's free and it's done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| $700 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| seven years, 5,000 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| of fiber cable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| ballpark, just directional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| guidance for the professor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| $450 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| 200,000 customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| $2,250 per customer of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| You could have people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| paying hundreds of dollars more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| a year for electricity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| or to pay for this network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| before they actually benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| So, what I would recommend is in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| the economic analysis, again, it's fascinating analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| It's just missing the critical piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| of how much this network's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| Third point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| $700 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| You have to be careful about what that asset's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| valued at the end of seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| Amazon is developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| satellites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| Qualcomm's developing 5G technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| There is a risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| that you could have built the fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| group of fiber in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| and the value of it will be substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| less than you think at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| seven years. And then the last point I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| make is I've talked to a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| who say, well, the federal government's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| And I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| that you want to rush this through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| because you don't want to miss a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| But most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| of this money is still uncertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| The broadband budget was $100 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| a month ago. It's $65 billion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| Initial treasury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| analysis recommendation is to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| that the money only goes to places that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| are unserved, which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| a plan to rebuild the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| market and cover everybody again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| might not qualify. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| I appreciate your interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| in trying to rush this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| but if you think you're going...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| There's a lot of uncertainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| what's going to happen in terms of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| You may end up paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| It may be a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| It may be years before you get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| And I'm not saying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| Just make sure you look at the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| So, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8519)|

| 2:23:27| just doesn't work, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| as the pandemic has proven working from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8609)|

| 2:23:39| too long or you reach your data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8619)|

| 2:23:43| speeds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| are slower than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8625)|

| 2:23:49| It's terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| Since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| I moved into the residence I'm in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| just now, I've done my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| homework. I've tried to reach out to people like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| Comcast, people like AT&T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| to see what can be done. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| I'm about a mile and a half from AT&T's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| lines. I'm about two and a half miles from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| Comcast's lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| I reached out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| the woman, I don't know where she went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| but she was up here and she basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| said my argument exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| She's reached out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| lady at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Economic and Community Development for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| Tennessee and I've done the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| thing. She put me in contact with AT&T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| and it's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| resistance, resistance, resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| We can't do that. It's going to cost too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| money for the amount of money we're going to get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| They passed me on to Comcast. It's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| thing. It's going to cost $85,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| to run two and a half miles of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| lines to your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| Yeah, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| we're in the 21st century and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| unfortunately it's not going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| them enough money so we just have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| suck it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| to say that, I'm in favour of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| KUB's proposal here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| at the end of the day they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| to give everyone, regardless of where they live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| and how much money they can pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| the same service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| At least a baseline of the same service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| yeah, I mean, all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| to say that I'm really appreciative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| of the work they've done and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| given the day and age that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| we're in, we can't, I don't think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| wait for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| an approval to go here. It has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| happen sooner rather than later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| because we're seeing this at the federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| bridging the digital divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| and here KUB have stepped in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| to say, we're going to do this, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| let them do it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| Thank you, Mr. Hutchin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8739)|

| 2:25:53| You can start by stating your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8757)|

| 2:26:07| but I am also here on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| of the 450 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| that live here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| Knoxville and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| out of our office at 5720| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| I think to start out with, I'd just like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| that Comcast is aligned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| really many of the policy issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| that have been raised throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| this conversation both here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| and in the hearings that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| preceded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| One, we believe strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| that families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| and businesses should have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| to affordable broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| And number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| we support economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| and community connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| by delivering innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| services over an advanced broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| This team of 450| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| Knoxville employees, many of whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| are here tonight, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| others wanted to be here but are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| taking care of customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| have leaned in to some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| these issues that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| First, the issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| In 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| we launched a program called Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| Essentials in order to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| low-income families that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| come from economically challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| households can get connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| And in the 10 years since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| we've launched, we have connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| over 10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8849)|

| 2:27:33| veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| parents since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| and we've pledged to do more with an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8857)|

| 2:28:21| three years, we've invested $23 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8901)|

| 2:28:55| these investments paid off as we were all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8935)|

| 2:29:11| We agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| with state and federal policymakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8953)|

| 2:29:21| In fact, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| proposed a public-private partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8963)|

| 2:29:27| affordability, and technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| at a fraction of the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| that is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| through the KUB offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| As importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| I want to highlight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| the market is a competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| one. There are a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| of 10 other providers in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| County. And if KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| does decide to enter into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| broadband business, that will be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| 11th competitor, at least an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| 11th competitor, but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| just one more competitor in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| It's also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| government utility that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| controls access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9003)|

| 2:30:09| regard, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| it is important for the city as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| regulator of the rights of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| and as the entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| that ultimately oversees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| the contracting authority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| KUB, at least in terms of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| to poles, that we ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| that there is a level playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| with regard to access to utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| poles, with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| the relationship with the city and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| permitting authority that it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| and even to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| that there are safeguards with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| to cross subsidies from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| the electric utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9041)|

| 2:30:45| So with that, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| would suggest that there is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| dialogue and public conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| that is required in order to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| the best options for affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9053)|

| 2:33:23| is. It would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| for everyone to get access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9205)|

| 2:33:35| you need to consider the price too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| If they increase the prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| some families who will stay behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9221)|

| 2:33:59| it will be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9241)|

| 2:34:07| whatever they are uploading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9247)|

| 2:34:11| Not to count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| to the rich only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| we need to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| the poor families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9257)|

| 2:34:23| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| this is the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| I would request here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| Most of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9271)|

| 2:34:55| Then that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| I asked if I can come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9297)|

| 2:35:11| helpful, we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9311)|

| 2:35:19| so we can know what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| going on in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9321)|

| 2:35:25| and my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| get better service, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| not increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| the 90% for the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9333)|

| 2:35:49| Bri Eisley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9349)|
| 2:35:59| If you could start by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| for the record and you will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| Hi, thanks for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| My name is Bri Eisley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| I live at 5316 Pinnacle Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| I'm really glad to see all the folks here tonight to speak about KUV's broadband proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9373)|
| 2:36:20| KUV is a public utility, and ratepayers have a right to be involved in the decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9380)|
| 2:36:26| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| And KUV provides services like electricity and water that are all resources that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| They're human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| And I'm not here to speak for or against the broadband program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| I guess basically what I'm here to talk about is that it's really important that equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9399)|
| 2:36:44| is considered in the build-out of the broadband plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| And I really hope that all of the folks who are engaged here tonight to speak in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| of broadband will continue to be engaged in the process, as well as city council and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9411)|
| 2:36:56| mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| And I really hope, too, that we'll see other—I know KUV will be working to engage the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| and I hope to see more diverse turnout in some of the communities that, you know, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| are low-income, more involved in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| So again, I'm wanting to speak towards centering equity in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| It's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| This proposal does involve a 3% annual rate increase over four years to pay for necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| infrastructure upgrades, and that will have a real impact on KUV customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9444)|
| 2:37:31| I know the next item on the agenda is about a low-income broadband internet program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| That's—I'm really glad to see that, but that's not going to be enough to center equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9456)|
| 2:37:42| in this broadband build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9462)|
| 2:37:44| During the beginning of the pandemic, KUV temporarily suspended utility disconnections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| and did so for longer than most other utilities in the TVA footprint, which is really commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9469)|
| 2:37:54| KUV also worked very hard with NOx, CAC, and other groups to coordinate utility bill support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9474)|
| 2:37:59| for households in need while disconnections had been suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| But in spite of these best efforts, 3,000 households were disconnected from their utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| services between October of 2020, when KUV resumed their shutoffs, and February of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9488)|
| 2:38:15| Meanwhile, more than 16,000 customers owed utility bill debt to KUV at the time disconnections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9495)|
| 2:38:21| were resumed in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| The NOxville Water and Energy for All campaign, which involves organizations like One NOx| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| Legacy, Three Cubed, NOxville Service Industry United, and Appalachian Voices, have conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| research on the impacts of utility bill debt and utility disconnections on KUV customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9514)|
| 2:38:40| using data that was shared with us by KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| Through this research, we found it is likely that all KUV customers at 150 percent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9524)|
| 2:38:49| federal poverty line have utility bills that are higher than 10 percent of their income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9529)|
| 2:38:53| which is considered unaffordable by experts across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| Perhaps more importantly, we found that communities of color are 200 percent more likely to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| disconnected from their utilities than white neighborhoods served by KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| And communities of color also owe twice as much utility bill debt, illustrating a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| racial disparity and need for utility justice at KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| We're really grateful to KUV for sharing this data with us and for joining us in many conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| But it's also important to point out that this is the first time that research to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| the impacts of utility burden and utility disconnections on different demographics has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| been conducted for the KUV service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| One solution that could address the serious problem of utility bill unaffordability at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9577)|
| 2:39:41| KUV is a percentage of income payment plan, or a PIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| PIPs are designed to limit utility bills to an affordable level of less than 10 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9585)|
| 2:39:50| of income for low-income customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| They've been implemented successfully at utilities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9592)|
| 2:39:57| So as you all consider KUV's broadband plan, please continue to push KUV, please ratepayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| who have shown out, please continue to be involved in the discussion to center equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9608)|
| 2:40:09| Because again, a low-income broadband affordability program is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9609)|
| 2:40:15| There needs to be an affordability program that addresses all of KUV's utility services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9615)|
| 2:40:22| And a percentage of income payment plan could do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9622)|
| 2:40:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9624)|
| 2:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| Council members, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9626)|
| 2:40:27| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9627)|
| 2:40:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9628)|
| 2:40:29| I would like to continue discussion, but I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9629)|
| 2:40:30| Motion made to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9630)|
| 2:40:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| And second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| Council Member Singh, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| You have some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| Great speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| And I really appreciate all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9637)|
| 2:40:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9638)|
| 2:40:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9640)|
| 2:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9642)|
| 2:40:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9643)|
| 2:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9644)|
| 2:40:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9650)|
| 2:40:51| I remember the first time I met with Mr. Bola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| I think I said, hello, when are we bringing broadband here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| So this is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| But the last speaker brought up some really good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| So I think the devil is in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| I am for this plan, but we've got to think it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| There are people whose rates are going to be going up, there's a lot of misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| out there, there are a lot of concerns about, if we're all going to take on this expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9672)|
| 2:41:19| Is it going to go to the places that need it the most first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| So those are some of the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| I'd like to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| How are we going to get it into the hands of the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| are not connected right now, low income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| There are other low income plans out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| like internet essentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| So there are some plans out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9697)|
| 2:41:38| How are we going to do better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| Mr. Bullis, if you want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9702)|
| 2:41:46| So I thought a lot of stuff there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| so I thought I'd unpack it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9708)|
| 2:41:49| We all know who you are, but if you could for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| Gabriel Bullis, president and CEO of KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| So yes, we've had a lot of conversations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| So I guess I'll start out first with, and it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| fundamental, we have discovered and learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| that fiber is essential to our electric system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| We have used it in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9725)|
| 2:42:06| We've built it in parts of our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| It is the core to our future reliability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| for our entire network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9730)|
| 2:42:11| You've heard it from folks today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| So we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| We're going to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| We're going to build a fiber network for ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| after it runs our electric grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| So with that being said, there will be rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| for that regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| And with that information, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9746)|
| 2:42:29| going to look at where our reliability is the worst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| where those folks are underserved first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| and serve those customers with priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| Once again, the plan will serve everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| that has an electric meter if they want our service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| But the grid, but the criteria will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| be along those lines of who needs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| where's our reliability bad, and think about criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| And so when we get to that point of decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| we'll be taking input from a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| Once again, we're a public utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| We're bound and held accountable by the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| that are our customers, including the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| and county commission and all those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| So we will be transparent to that whole discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| That's how the plan will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| Does that answer your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| And then we have low income programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| We have lots of programs we've been doing for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| And we've continued doing those programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| that need it the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9794)|
| 2:43:15| I can discuss that in a lot of detail if you want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| So I think some of the programs that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| are based on reduced school lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| So that's one criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| There are people whose children are out of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| There are other populations that have fixed incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| So the next item we'll vote on is the city's participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| So those are a concern as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| I'm wondering if that's a criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| we can use to how we roll this out into the neighborhoods that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| have the most reduced lunches and the most fixed incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9832)|
| 2:43:57| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9837)|
| 2:43:58| We intentionally have not laid out that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| We want to have input from this council, from our customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| about how we determine that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| Yes, Chattanooga's program was based on pre-reduced lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| And it's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| Those folks down there, those kiddos and their parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| many thousands of people have signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| for free internet, high speed internet for their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| And that was our criteria done with Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| Schools, City of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| Some private foundations got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| So we have seen that model work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9863)|
| 2:44:24| So we use that as a template.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| But we have not intentionally laid that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| because we want input from you all and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| about what the criteria should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| I will tell you, we want it easy for those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| to sign up and get that service in determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| what is a low income, what's the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| It's something we need for input from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| So it's framework only, not details yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| Because once again, until we get up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| there's no money to be had to fund that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| And so we have a good year or so, if approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| to determine that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| So does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9894)|
| 2:44:55| Yeah, that we need to keep on talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| One last question, and then I'll let my other members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| council members, ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| What do we say to the people who, they have good cable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| they are happy, they're connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| they've got a good rate going, and their rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| is going to go up by 3%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| So once again, we are building this primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| for the electric grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| We're going to build a fiber network for the electric grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| It increases reliability for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| As stated by some of the folks before me that have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| Chattanooga's seen a 40% to 50% reduction in outages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| That's huge for our community, huge for our folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| our businesses, our commercial, industrial customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9931)|
| 2:45:34| So that's what we're doing about first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| That puts the backbone of fiber in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| What we're asking the board, this council today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| is just allow us to sell that as a broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| service to our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| That's really all it is when it gets down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| Allow us to give that service to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| We'll have the backbone built as part of our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| What can we do to get permission to do the next part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| And so that funding source then funds the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| and so that's why we don't have rate increases for future years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| because that funding source is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| The benefit is reliability is good for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| I don't care where you live, who you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| what part of the city, county, or community you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9965)|
| 2:46:09| Secondly, the big plus is, going back to the study done by UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9969)|
| 2:46:15| it's an economic benefit for this entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| I mean, a 1% gross domestic product is hundreds of millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| of dollars a year for the Knoxville area in growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| Someone referred to the study done in UT Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| $2.5 billion of growth has occurred in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| We've heard enough times how businesses are going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9992)|
| 2:46:35| how folks are moving away because of that lack of high-speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9999)|
| 2:46:39| So that helps everybody also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| So that's in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| I guess it lifts all of Knoxville up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| It fills it up, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| Thank you, Council Member Singh, Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| and then Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| I'm curious why the business plan did not include a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10013)|
| 2:47:04| for a low-income program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10024)|
| 2:47:09| Jamie Davis, I'm Vice President at KEB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| I've been working with the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| I live at 3104 Bogey Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| Bottom line was it wasn't a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10035)|
| 2:47:16| of the actual business plans that we submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| Those templates and requirements of those business plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10038)|
| 2:47:22| were kind of set by the entities that lay those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| And a lot of it is, too, is because there are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| frameworks that we wanted to work through trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| to gain funding for this to answer specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10051)|
| 2:47:34| about requirements of that low-income program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10054)|
| 2:47:36| And we'll talk about it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| I mean, Chattanooga really has been a trailblazer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| in this particular area to say, blanketly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| every kid that meets a certain criteria gets this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| So we're doing this aspirationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10066)|
| 2:47:47| trying to model it after something that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10069)|
| 2:47:50| And frankly, about how many kiddos we can serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10070)|
| 2:47:52| or who would qualify really depends on funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10072)|
| 2:47:55| And so the second agreement tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| really starts to speak together about us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| working with local government in a unique solution to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| But to bridge that gap, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| to have to have other sources of public and private funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| much like Chattanooga, to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| So again, a little more definite on our business plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10089)|
| 2:48:12| about providing the service, but again, a little more, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| aspirational in trying to lay out a framework by which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| pledge to do that as part of this overall launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| And one reason I ask that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| is I wondered, when looking at the proposed rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| over three years, if your assessment was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| that through those rate increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| KUB would not be able to afford this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| without the additional financial support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| So one additional question I had is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| did you consider excluding low-income communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| from the rate increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| I don't think we can do that per our regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| Mark, address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10135)|
| 2:48:56| Yes, I'm Mark Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10136)|
| 2:48:57| I'm CFO at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| I live at 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| We are required by numerous sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| such as our TVA power supply contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| They essentially regulate KUB's electric finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| and also even the city charter that we and our bond covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| to charge the same rate, charge a uniform rate for utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| services to all residential customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| So we're not allowed to say we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| going to charge this group more or less than everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10162)|
| 2:49:30| Those are all my questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10170)|
| 2:49:31| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| Yeah, I could touch on a lot, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| would be a lot of discussion that might come back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| But I'm going to start with, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10180)|
| 2:49:41| talk about the rate increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10181)|
| 2:49:45| So recently, there was an agreement by KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| to do no rate increases for a certain amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10192)|
| 2:49:53| On the fixed, on these customer service charges, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| OK, and how long is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| Five years, 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10198)|
| 2:49:59| OK, that's for 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10201)|
| 2:50:02| So I will just state, I have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| from tons of constituents who are in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| And then I've heard from, I will honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10210)|
| 2:50:14| say, a smaller number of people who are not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| But the purveying concern among those who are not in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10217)|
| 2:50:23| is that they feel that they're having to pay and subsidize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| something they're not getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| So my understanding is that is a misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| So can I ask you to clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| Because their emails to me are, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| going to have to pay $10 and some change more per month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| because other people are going to get something that I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10243)|
| 2:50:47| want and I'm not interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| Could you clarify that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| Maybe they do a better job than I can, but that's a guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| Of that, those 3.3% increases, 6% of that 9%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10255)|
| 2:51:00| was previously planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| That goes to fund our electric system century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| two upgrades, pole replacements, substation upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| et cetera, throughout our electric system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| The other 3% goes to fund the fiber network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| to help fund the fiber network, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| will be also a critical part of our electrical distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10280)|
| 2:51:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10281)|
| 2:51:22| So it is clear and accurate to say to our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10282)|
| 2:51:29| if this doesn't happen, there's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| increases coming, not to the fixed rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| But to the electric rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10295)|
| 2:51:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10296)|
| 2:51:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10297)|
| 2:51:38| Essentially, all of the increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| that we have talked about are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10300)|
| 2:51:41| going to happen because the fiber network needs to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| If we don't go forward with broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| if we're not authorized to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| that expense for the fiber network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| may be spread out over a slightly longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| But ultimately, those 3.3% are going to happen regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10315)|
| 2:51:59| And also to the point that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10319)|
| 2:52:02| into some of the details here, but the fiber division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| or the broadband division will be paying electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| for use of the electric system assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| in providing the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| That is a pretty substantial amount of annual revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10331)|
| 2:52:14| once a full build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| That helps stabilize electric rates over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| So this is actually a good thing in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| but it will help stabilize electric rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| In our forecast, we're showing no electric rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| forecast for the next seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| after the third increase, and probably well beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10352)|
| 2:52:35| And a big part of that being able to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| is the revenue coming from the fiber division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| to the electric division for using electric system assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10360)|
| 2:52:44| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10364)|
| 2:52:45| The last question I'll ask for right now is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10365)|
| 2:52:49| in the fourth district is Holston Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| which one comment tonight, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| seen from constituents there, they have one service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| But they also, and I know we've talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| is they have a lot of electric outages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| I think when we talk about electric outages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| and reliability of the electric network, many of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| don't have that many issues, so we don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| that that's a major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| It is a major concern in Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| It happens routinely for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| And I usually am sitting at home like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| because there's nothing I can do for my constituents that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| for example, this year wrapped their presents by flashlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| and found ways to stay warm because it's very cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| So is this going to help Holston Hills in that manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10411)|
| 2:53:34| not from a broadband perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10414)|
| 2:53:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10416)|
| 2:53:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10417)|
| 2:53:38| The goal is to completely build a fiber network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10418)|
| 2:53:41| and put in intelligent devices, become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10421)|
| 2:53:42| smart switches, throughout our entire service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| Those switches allow this isolation of outages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10425)|
| 2:53:48| like when a tree falls, let's say, or a car hits a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| Right now, a lot of people see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10431)|
| 2:53:53| With these switches, it automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10433)|
| 2:53:54| isolates that problem and keeps it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| to a very minimal amount of customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| while the rest of the system stays up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| You don't even see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| We have tested those switches in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| Hence, the 150 miles of fiber we have installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| And they work beautifully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| They do require fiber to work efficiently and quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10447)|
| 2:54:10| in order for that to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10450)|
| 2:54:11| So yes, long term, everybody gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| a benefit from the reliability of our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| and the benefits of that fiber network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| Thank you, Council Member Fugate and Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| Just for the record, I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| that asking for a postponement is not the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10468)|
| 2:54:33| as asking to kill something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10473)|
| 2:54:36| I just kind of want that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| There are some implications that if you don't want to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10477)|
| 2:54:41| tonight or you wanted a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| that you are trying to kill KUV getting broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| I am saying that because we're asking a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10487)|
| 2:54:52| here tonight that we've been getting from constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| And this is our first time as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10494)|
| 2:54:58| to sit together and hear one another talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| about this publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| That's why I was in favor of a workshop prior to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10503)|
| 2:55:09| That being said, I'll ask my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| But I just want that on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| because there are a lot of assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| being made about people's intentions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| are not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| Question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10521)|
| 2:55:22| First of all, one of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10522)|
| 2:55:23| I keep getting is the rush, why the rush, why the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10523)|
| 2:55:31| Federal money, federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| And if we don't vote tonight, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| going to kill broadband because the federal money will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10534)|
| 2:55:38| Can someone tell me what is the federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10538)|
| 2:55:43| has it been allocated, and when can you apply for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10543)|
| 2:55:48| So it has not been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| We've heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10551)|
| 2:55:52| No, we don't all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| Well, it's not been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| It's been discussed by the administration numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| There's $65 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| They're working on that detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| It could be approved any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10560)|
| 2:56:01| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| But if we're not set up as an entity, we can't apply for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| So that's the sense of urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| But I will say, we don't feel as though there's been a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10568)|
| 2:56:13| We've been discussing this for over a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| We've had many conversations, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10575)|
| 2:56:16| can go into a lot of detail if you want me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| about what we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| No, I mean, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10579)|
| 2:56:20| So to me, I don't feel it's a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| We've been discussing this for over a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10582)|
| 2:56:25| What I meant by that is, it's the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| council has publicly discussed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| 12 days after the KUB board voted to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10591)|
| 2:56:36| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| Council Member Fugate, I think Ms. Gill has some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10597)|
| 2:56:41| response to your question about the funds and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10603)|
| 2:56:44| I'll just clarify, if you'd like me to, Ms. Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| about some of the other resources that we have our eye on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| Can you let me finish my thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| But now you've stopped it, so I've probably lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| Sorry, but I try to follow your lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| So just in addition to the federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| one of the resources that we have our eyes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| and I know KUB would as well, but the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| has also received the American Rescue Plan funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| that you all authorized our receipt of tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10630)|
| 2:57:14| Based on information presented by the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| Department of the Treasury, they have $3.725 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| from that resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10641)|
| 2:57:22| And evidence-based and high ROI investments in broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10642)|
| 2:57:25| those are their terms, is one of the recommended priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| that they have identified for use of that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| So again, the other caveat with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| is that per the federal guidance attached to those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10655)|
| 2:57:38| projects to pursue those types of broadband investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| must prioritize nonprofit or government-owned networks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| and fiber optic technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| So that is a resource that is in hand at the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| And similar to our timeline, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| be making those decisions locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| just as the state will be making their decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10675)|
| 2:57:56| And I think that's another resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10676)|
| 2:57:57| we should have our eye on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10677)|
| 2:57:58| So what I'm hearing from you is there's a pot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| that only KUB could get that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10680)|
| 2:58:03| available to for-profit providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| I think we would have to wait and see the final state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10688)|
| 2:58:09| But the indication is that, again, the federal guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| has prioritized the nonprofit for government-owned networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| OK, I know where I was going with your comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| about public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| I absolutely agree that KUB has done a fabulous public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10699)|
| 2:58:24| for their decision-making with their board, which we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| been privy to and understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| But I also think there's some people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| don't pay attention to the KUB board that pay more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| attention to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| So that was my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| It was not a disparaging comment about the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| that KUB did, because I think you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| did a very fine public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10722)|
| 2:58:45| Next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| This is for the money people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10727)|
| 2:58:48| So for the 35%, the business plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10728)|
| 2:58:53| which I believe I understand, the business plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| was created in order to satisfy the requirements required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| by the regulatory authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| That's the way you did your business plan, not for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10743)|
| 2:59:07| like, if you were coming to me back in the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| when I made a loan, you would have had to have more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| But my question about the 35% is because what I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| was if 35% of the people switch, then it helps financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10756)|
| 2:59:26| So that sounds to me like switching not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| new customers for the underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| So I want some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| I would say ultimately, there's 500,000 customers, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| We can boil that down into homes for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| But at the end of the day, it's obtainment of 35%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10783)|
| 2:59:44| And so some of those, when you hear unserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| well, that can be one of those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| For those that want choice, it's one of those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| as well, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| And so at the end of the day, that 35%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| is a conservative number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| Through research and other folks' experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| we've seen those, on average, be somewhere 50% to 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| And so I think a speaker said it was a conservative number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10803)|
| 3:00:07| but it's good to be conservative when laying out that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10809)|
| 3:00:09| I just wanted clarification that it's not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| taking away 35% of business from for-profit people right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10812)|
| 3:00:18| No, by definition, we acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| that the current providers will still be here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| They're still in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| I'm just trying to make sure that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| people look at your math, what we're actually talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10825)|
| 3:00:33| You've already answered my question that you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| fiber regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| Your board has decided that KUB is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10838)|
| 3:00:41| going to invest in fiber for electric stability, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10841)|
| 3:00:47| some cybersecurity and national security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| too, to make our system more safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10850)|
| 3:00:56| But by offering broadband, it's a revenue source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10856)|
| 3:01:00| that can help offset the long-term costs to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| of KUB's customers for the fiber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| because that's happening regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10866)|
| 3:01:09| The last thing I will say, I think, for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| I can't promise forever, but at least for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| is I will say many of you in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| know that I've worked in the banking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| industry for 27-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10881)|
| 3:01:24| And I absolutely understand the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10884)|
| 3:01:29| of for-profit businesses who compete with nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10889)|
| 3:01:33| or government entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| It feels like very unfair competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| I will say banks felt that when credit unions were allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10899)|
| 3:01:45| to then start serving people who weren't just their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10905)|
| 3:01:50| Remember way back in the day when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| if you belonged to a credit union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| you had to work for the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10913)|
| 3:01:57| And that was a huge change for banking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| We hated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| We hated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10923)|
| 3:02:03| We hated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| Because it wasn't fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| Credit unions are not subject to CRA obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| They don't pay income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| So it did feel like very unfair competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10932)|
| 3:02:15| But here we are years later, and banks are still in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| Credit unions are still in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| And they just serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| Everybody's had to up their game and serve different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10944)|
| 3:02:27| So what I will say is that it is unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10947)|
| 3:02:32| It feels very unfair to compete with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10952)|
| 3:02:36| that don't have the same constraints that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| do as a private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| Because private businesses do have to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10963)|
| 3:02:46| They're not evil people who don't want to serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| But they have shareholders, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10970)|
| 3:02:52| have different obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10972)|
| 3:02:53| So I also want this to go on the record of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10973)|
| 3:02:58| a for-profit business is not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| It pays a lot of people's salaries, and it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10981)|
| 3:03:04| But they have different constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| and different shareholders and obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| that they have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| The utility changes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| I do think we are at a point, and this, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10993)|
| 3:03:16| the real discussion is, are we at a point in a country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=10996)|
| 3:03:21| and in our city where we believe that what we may be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11001)|
| 3:03:27| tonight is voting to create a fifth utility, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11007)|
| 3:03:33| will compete with private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11013)|
| 3:03:36| but the two don't have to be mutually exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11022)|
| 3:03:43| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| Going back, I'm not trying to beat a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| I'm just trying to break down some of the numbers again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11030)|
| 3:03:54| So obviously, of the $450 to $500 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11034)|
| 3:03:59| investment in infrastructure, can you break out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11039)|
| 3:04:02| I mean, it's been made clear that with or without broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11042)|
| 3:04:07| this is moving forward with the electrical grid upgrade, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| was already projected over 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| to be a rate increase of roughly $6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11053)|
| 3:04:17| And now we're looking at $9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| But of that amount, how much is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11059)|
| 3:04:22| allocated to the fiber to the home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11062)|
| 3:04:30| So again, the 9% total, and I'll let CFO jump in here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11070)|
| 3:04:35| Again, we have proposed this full deployment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| of this technology in addition to our existing plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11078)|
| 3:04:42| So of that 9%, 6% was planned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11082)|
| 3:04:45| And that additional 3% would fund this additional growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11085)|
| 3:04:48| that would support fiber to the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| So what we've said, if you break down that on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11090)|
| 3:04:53| our average customer will have about $10.60 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| at full rate implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| They would pay additional for all of our improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11098)|
| 3:05:01| Century 2 and this additional grid modernization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11101)|
| 3:05:04| of which $6.60-ish is for the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| $3.60-ish, I think, is the grid modernization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11108)|
| 3:05:12| OK, so breaking down in dollars, if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| looking at $450 to $500 million, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| really looking at $125 to $150 dedication at the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11118)|
| 3:05:21| Well, again, that number that we've used for $500 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| there is for this enhanced grid modernization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| So all of it ultimately builds that fiber network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11126)|
| 3:05:30| Our existing fiber plant was for 300 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| to connect our substations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11133)|
| 3:05:34| This would take it all the way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| to street level and to homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11136)|
| 3:05:37| So that $500 million is really that incremental investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11137)|
| 3:05:41| that the 3% total on the rate increases, along with debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| along with fiber access, ultimately fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| that additional improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11148)|
| 3:05:51| So it takes that 300 miles of fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11151)|
| 3:05:54| that the 6% was going to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| along with a lot of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| and ultimately takes that to 5,000 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| on our distribution system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11163)|
| 3:06:04| So in total, it's looking at 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| 6% was going to happen anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| Century 2 upgrades, other electric system costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| The 3% is to help fund this $440 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| capital investment in the fiber network, and also to the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11175)|
| 3:06:22| And so, you know, and to Councilwoman Hugot's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11182)|
| 3:06:27| so it's a difference between a revenue source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11187)|
| 3:06:30| or the electrical upgrade with no revenue, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| In a different time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| I do have a question for Mr. Mackey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11199)|
| 3:06:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11208)|
| 3:06:49| So I know that we've been just in communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| that Comcast is committed to, or is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11213)|
| 3:06:59| roughly a $21.7, I think, million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| dollar improvement in theory to, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11221)|
| 3:07:07| don't know if it's to accomplish the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| but can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11230)|
| 3:07:11| Who benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11231)|
| 3:07:12| Are there upgrades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| Does it benefit current subscribers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| What, can you elaborate on sort of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| So there's a couple of components there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| First, in terms of getting broadband service to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| that don't have it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| So there is a handful in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11249)|
| 3:07:34| The majority of them are within the KB footprint fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11254)|
| 3:07:39| within Union County and Granger County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11259)|
| 3:07:42| We think there is roughly a little less than 6,000 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11262)|
| 3:07:47| and businesses in the aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| So maybe about 3% of the overall footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11269)|
| 3:07:53| So our proposal is to extend broadband to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11273)|
| 3:08:00| We can do that in 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11280)|
| 3:08:03| And that would be at a total cost of roughly $22 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11283)|
| 3:08:08| of which we would invest about $10 million of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11288)|
| 3:08:14| And the remaining $12 million would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| come from either the state broadband fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| or from the ARP dollars that are allocated to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11299)|
| 3:08:25| of those respective counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| So the public costs would be somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| in the neighborhood of about $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11309)|
| 3:08:33| That would extend service to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| that do not have it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| In terms of people that do have broadband infrastructure today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11318)|
| 3:08:42| independent of that plan, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11322)|
| 3:08:46| really two components that I'll outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| One is we are in a continual upgrade cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11329)|
| 3:08:52| as I alluded to in my comments earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11332)|
| 3:08:56| We invest in roughly doubling the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11336)|
| 3:09:00| of our existing network every 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11340)|
| 3:09:04| in order to handle increased traffic and projected traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| We are also building in new features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| So more cybersecurity protections and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11353)|
| 3:09:18| data privacy concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| So that all happens with company investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| There is no public requirement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11365)|
| 3:09:28| The other piece that is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11368)|
| 3:09:32| is getting people online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| And certainly, we'll have a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11374)|
| 3:09:36| to talk about it in the next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| But when we launched Internet Essentials in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11379)|
| 3:09:44| we began by looking at the analysis of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11384)|
| 3:09:47| is preventing people from getting online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11387)|
| 3:09:50| And it really falls in three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11390)|
| 3:09:53| First is the cost of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11393)|
| 3:09:56| Second is the cost of the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11396)|
| 3:10:00| The third barrier, and actually by far the largest barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11400)|
| 3:10:04| is digital literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| And the comfort level with the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11407)|
| 3:10:11| could be language barriers, could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11411)|
| 3:10:12| be any number of things that kind of fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| within that bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| And the Internet Essentials program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| was designed with a few central tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| One was a broad partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| And indeed, we've worked with schools, churches, governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11424)|
| 3:10:28| nonprofits, in order to create awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11428)|
| 3:10:33| to know that people can get internet service for $9.95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| a month, but also to subsidize the purchase of a computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11436)|
| 3:10:42| and to address that digital literacy training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| So within our proposal, we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| to continue that program as part of really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| a national rollout, as well as participating in programs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11453)|
| 3:10:57| are publicly available today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| Emergency Broadband Benefit is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| where the federal government is subsidizing a $50 subsidy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11463)|
| 3:11:07| for families, regardless of what level of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| they subscribe to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11470)|
| 3:11:12| To date, we have 2,200 families in the Knox County area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| that have signed up for that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| We're also investing in partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11479)|
| 3:11:22| with community organizations, like the Knoxville Urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11482)|
| 3:11:26| League, like the Shora Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11486)|
| 3:11:27| like Boys and Girls Clubs, to stand up innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| and training centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11492)|
| 3:11:33| We call them lift zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11493)|
| 3:11:35| And our commitment is to stand up 20 of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| and invest $2 million where they have high-speed connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| but also where there is training delivered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11502)|
| 3:11:45| whether that is digital literacy training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11505)|
| 3:11:48| or that is job skill training so that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| have the digital skills that are required for employment today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| So again, it's the three components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11515)|
| 3:11:56| It's the expansion of service to people that don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11516)|
| 3:12:01| There is the continued focus on affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11521)|
| 3:12:04| and not just a low-cost service or a subsidized service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| but also the digital literacy training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| that people need in order to utilize the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11529)|
| 3:12:13| And then continual investment in the network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11533)|
| 3:12:16| both in terms of the facilities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| may sit on the pole or underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11539)|
| 3:12:22| but also the technology that drives it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11545)|
| 3:12:26| And is that $22 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11546)|
| 3:12:27| Is that expansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| Is that fiber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| That would be fiber, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11554)|
| 3:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11555)|
| 3:12:36| One more question to Mr. Bolas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11556)|
| 3:12:40| And Mr. Mackey had kind of mentioned this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11560)|
| 3:12:44| Can you speak to kind of the level playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11564)|
| 3:12:48| that he mentioned when it comes to permitting, access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11568)|
| 3:12:51| to poles, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11571)|
| 3:12:55| So I think there was two or three parts to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11575)|
| 3:13:00| One was access on right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| And I think that's actually a question for the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11582)|
| 3:13:04| and counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11584)|
| 3:13:05| You all control the right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11585)|
| 3:13:06| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11586)|
| 3:13:07| We just permit the same way everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11587)|
| 3:13:08| has to to get in, put our poles and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11588)|
| 3:13:11| on the right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11591)|
| 3:13:12| So I defer to your experts on public right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11592)|
| 3:13:16| Like I said, we permit just like everybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11596)|
| 3:13:18| As far as access to poles, we have always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| had a very detailed process on access to our poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11601)|
| 3:13:25| They pay us rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| If we're on somebody else's pole, we pay them rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| That process has not really changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11609)|
| 3:13:31| We update the contract every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| But that's a very normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11613)|
| 3:13:37| Once again, we've had lots of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| that want to put stuff on our poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| And so to answer that question, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| have had contracts in place for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11623)|
| 3:13:46| And we are currently trying to work with Comcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11626)|
| 3:13:48| on a contract extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11628)|
| 3:13:50| It's been expired for over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11630)|
| 3:13:52| And once that's in place, we can get that back in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11632)|
| 3:13:55| Anything you want to add to that, Jamie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| Our electric rate payers benefit from attachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11637)|
| 3:14:00| So we see that as a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| And I think Mr. Bowles has pledged publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| that we would continue to work with all of our providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| in that particular regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11646)|
| 3:14:07| There's really no reason not to in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| And time will just tell if our pledge is indeed real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| But that would not be KEB's intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11653)|
| 3:14:14| to have any way in which we would prohibit others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11654)|
| 3:14:17| in achieving their business goals in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11657)|
| 3:14:20| That's good for Knoxville in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11663)|
| 3:14:24| Thanks, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| I'm going to go to Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11666)|
| 3:14:29| I think you had your light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11669)|
| 3:14:32| OK, well, if we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| I was going to let everyone who hasn't spoken go and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| come back to people for round two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11677)|
| 3:14:39| So we'll go to Council Member Smith, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| Vice Mayor McKenzie, and then Ms. Parker and Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| It might be a minute, but we'll break it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11685)|
| 3:14:49| I think everybody here wants affordable access for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11689)|
| 3:14:53| in our city, and apparently in surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| and people that rely on this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11696)|
| 3:14:59| to serve them in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| There's a certain percentage of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| who don't have any access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11703)|
| 3:15:04| So we know about those folks, and we want to serve them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| I think 60% who have limited options, maybe one provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11708)|
| 3:15:13| We're all on the same page about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| And I want to give some credit to the private ISPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11715)|
| 3:15:21| Mr. Mack is here from Comcast, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11721)|
| 3:15:22| are others who have been in this community filling in the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| before we had this opportunity to discuss that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11726)|
| 3:15:30| So I appreciate, as a former credit union employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11730)|
| 3:15:33| I appreciate the reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| Yeah, I got a heart for banks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11734)|
| 3:15:39| They were serving folks before credit unions were needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11739)|
| 3:15:43| So I want to call that out, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11743)|
| 3:15:47| Particularly in the pandemic, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| was a lot of folks who were racing around trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| to get access to kids at homes that they could learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11751)|
| 3:15:55| And Comcast, in particular, played an extremely important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| role during the pandemic for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| The lift zones are commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11760)|
| 3:16:02| I think it's extremely important, the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| that you all jumped in and identified community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| organizations that are already doing good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| I think I saw Claudius somewhere here from Centro Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11769)|
| 3:16:13| But there are organizations already serving our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| and Comcast particularly jumped in to serve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| So with that said, some of the moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11778)|
| 3:16:24| I'm not proudest of are cursing internet chat functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| and support for any provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11789)|
| 3:16:30| So it's not fun for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| But with that said, I also want to commend some of those ISPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11792)|
| 3:16:36| who have been here, because they do employ, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11796)|
| 3:16:38| 400 people, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11798)|
| 3:16:39| Over 400 people in this Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| Some of those folks are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11802)|
| 3:16:43| They live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11803)|
| 3:16:44| They play baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11804)|
| 3:16:45| They go to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11805)|
| 3:16:46| And they're important in our community, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| So I do also think that there's an unfair advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11808)|
| 3:16:52| to a certain extent, in that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| are a global company, a national company, at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| And you all have to stretch those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11820)|
| 3:17:01| Whereas KUB would be able to focus specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11821)|
| 3:17:04| on folks who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11824)|
| 3:17:06| And I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| It's also, for the community, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11828)|
| 3:17:10| also a disadvantage in the sense that when you have to compete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11830)|
| 3:17:14| and you only have to focus on one market, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11834)|
| 3:17:19| I do think, though, the attempts by existing ISPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11839)|
| 3:17:22| have been insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11842)|
| 3:17:23| So the reason we're here today is because not everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| being reached and served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11845)|
| 3:17:26| And so that's why we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| So I think that's extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| We're not covered there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| And I'll tell you, just the fiber enhancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| needed in this community alone, not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11854)|
| 3:17:36| to help folks who aren't served by internet now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11856)|
| 3:17:39| we compete with Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11859)|
| 3:17:40| We've said that, the name of that city, a lot tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11860)|
| 3:17:44| We serve on the Chamber's Economic Development Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11864)|
| 3:17:48| And we lose companies that don't come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11868)|
| 3:17:51| that move to Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| Also, I know, being on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11874)|
| 3:17:57| that the age group that we do the worst in recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11877)|
| 3:18:00| or retaining are 25 to 54-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| And so I'm going to talk about folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| who are at the prime of their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| This comes into play significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| And I've pitched Knoxville to companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| and watched them go somewhere else because we didn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11893)|
| 3:18:16| So I think that's extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11896)|
| 3:18:20| The four things I think that are really important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11900)|
| 3:18:23| are, can this be done in a way that doesn't significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11903)|
| 3:18:28| burden our residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| Can we provide a unique path for low-income residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11911)|
| 3:18:35| And can we do so in a way that doesn't burden the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11915)|
| 3:18:38| budget long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11918)|
| 3:18:41| And, to Mr. Mackey's point, make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11921)|
| 3:18:42| that we keep competition fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11922)|
| 3:18:44| So those four things, I think, are extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11924)|
| 3:18:48| On the first one, burdening our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11928)|
| 3:18:52| we know this, council members know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| but I don't know that all the public knows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| But what is the average dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| expected to increase per month for electric or existing KEB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11938)|
| 3:19:05| customers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| So after the 3% rate increases, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| assuming we get approved to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| after the first 3%, 3% rate increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| the average bill will be $10.80 more a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| And the incremental amount just for fiber per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| what does that net impact to somebody's household?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11961)|
| 3:19:24| It really depends on what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11964)|
| 3:19:25| I mean, we've got numbers from $11 a month to $46 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11965)|
| 3:19:30| So I'll just speak for myself personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| I have Comcast's gig service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11972)|
| 3:19:35| Wait, sorry, before I get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11975)|
| 3:19:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11976)|
| 3:19:37| What is the incremental cost increase in electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11977)|
| 3:19:42| for the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11982)|
| 3:19:43| $3.60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| All right, so somebody at home that's watching this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11985)|
| 3:19:47| to do this, beyond what we're already planning to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11987)|
| 3:19:50| it's $3.60 more a month out of my wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| Correct, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11994)|
| 3:19:55| That helps fund the fiber network, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11997)|
| 3:19:58| If I want to purchase KEB's broadband service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=11998)|
| 3:20:03| what is the amount that I'm likely to save per month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12003)|
| 3:20:06| Yeah, that's what I thought you were asking before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12008)|
| 3:20:09| Yeah, and it depends on what you have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| So there's no apples to apples comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12012)|
| 3:20:13| really, in our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12013)|
| 3:20:14| We hear that they offer a gig service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12014)|
| 3:20:16| The gig service is a gig down, $40 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12016)|
| 3:20:19| That's $116 a month with a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12019)|
| 3:20:22| So I have that service, and I pay for the cap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12022)|
| 3:20:25| the unlimited cap, which is $30 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12025)|
| 3:20:26| So I pay $146 a month for one gig down, $40 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12026)|
| 3:20:30| Our service would be one gig up, one gig down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12030)|
| 3:20:32| unlimited for $65 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| Now, that's the apples to apples comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| Folks have cheaper plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| We know that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12038)|
| 3:20:38| They have a plan that maybe is $100, or $300, or $400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12038)|
| 3:20:42| or even $25 and $3, $25 down, $3 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12042)|
| 3:20:45| And so it depends on what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12045)|
| 3:20:46| But the average person will save,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| for a decent internet program, $11 to $46 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12048)|
| 3:20:52| OK, so for those keeping track at home through all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12052)|
| 3:20:54| there's going to be a pen and a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12054)|
| 3:20:56| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12056)|
| 3:20:58| The incremental cost to my family budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12058)|
| 3:20:59| is going to be $3.60 per month for my electric service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12059)|
| 3:21:03| If I take this, I'm going to likely save, at a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12063)|
| 3:21:06| $11 a month in internet costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12066)|
| 3:21:10| That's if I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12070)|
| 3:21:11| Yes, if you take it, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12071)|
| 3:21:12| So I'm going to be OK on the long run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12072)|
| 3:21:13| if I'm an internet customer for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12073)|
| 3:21:17| If I'm not, I think I understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| that the net improvement of the fiber network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12079)|
| 3:21:23| even if I don't become an internet customer of KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12083)|
| 3:21:27| will offset the $3.60 that I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12087)|
| 3:21:30| to have to pay to fund the whole infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12090)|
| 3:21:34| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12096)|
| 3:21:36| I want to make sure we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| Let me get it right to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12099)|
| 3:21:40| Get all the words right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| $3.60 incremental cost to me, if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| don't take the internet at all for my electrical service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12106)|
| 3:21:49| should be offset after seven to 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12109)|
| 3:21:53| by the savings from the overall fiber network itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12113)|
| 3:21:58| Is that what I heard earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12119)|
| 3:22:00| The revenues that the electric division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12120)|
| 3:22:02| will get from the fiber or broadband division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| will help mitigate the need for any future electric rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12125)|
| 3:22:08| increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12128)|
| 3:22:09| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12129)|
| 3:22:09| So over seven years, 10 years, 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12129)|
| 3:22:13| assuming everything we know today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| I may pay $3.60 a month now, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| going to make that up by not getting my rates increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| because we have a better fiber network 10 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| Is that what KUB is suggesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| That the fiber division would be a funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| At its peak, at that 35% take rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| the fiber division on those access fees and utilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12151)|
| 3:22:34| of that electric network will pay almost $30 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12154)|
| 3:22:37| So it becomes a revenue source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| That revenue source can take the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12159)|
| 3:22:40| of other prospective rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12160)|
| 3:22:42| to fund future electric investments on our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| Which, in fact, is what the Electric Power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| Board of Chattanooga has experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12167)|
| 3:22:50| with no rate increases in electric, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12170)|
| 3:22:54| back to the time that they launched this or fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12174)|
| 3:22:57| deployed their system there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12177)|
| 3:22:58| Good segue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12178)|
| 3:22:59| So the second question I have is related to Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12179)|
| 3:23:02| and their 2010, I think, was the start date for their broadband?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12185)|
| 3:23:06| Have they had to upgrade their fiber network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12186)|
| 3:23:08| I've heard Mr. Mackey clearly state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| that Comcast is continually upgrading their fiber network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12190)|
| 3:23:13| for cybersecurity reasons, service reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12193)|
| 3:23:16| It also results in having to get a new modem, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12196)|
| 3:23:20| Put that as a star as an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| But has Chattanooga upgraded their fiber network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12202)|
| 3:23:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| And I think Mackey makes a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| Everybody has to keep continuing to upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12208)|
| 3:23:30| The fiber is the platform that everybody's using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| It is the backbone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12212)|
| 3:23:33| It is, I wouldn't say infinite, but pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12213)|
| 3:23:36| an infinite source of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12216)|
| 3:23:38| What you change out is electronics on each end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12218)|
| 3:23:41| And so Comcast, AT&T, Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12221)|
| 3:23:44| have all done upgrades to their system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12224)|
| 3:23:46| with the wire they use today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12226)|
| 3:23:48| So 10 years from now, when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12228)|
| 3:23:49| to upgrade the fiber connect infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12229)|
| 3:23:53| particularly for broadband customers of KUV and Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12233)|
| 3:23:57| will non-broadband customers of KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12237)|
| 3:24:01| have to foot that bill 10 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| So the lion's share of the cost of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| is obviously the cable itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12247)|
| 3:24:08| It's a long-lived asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12248)|
| 3:24:10| So as we upgrade those electronics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12250)|
| 3:24:12| those very same upgrades on the electronics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12252)|
| 3:24:14| serve those distribution applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12256)|
| 3:24:17| It'll be part of our ordinary growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| And as we layer that in, if we don't need rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12259)|
| 3:24:22| because we have those other sources of revenue coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12262)|
| 3:24:25| that's what funds those upgrades as well, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| To answer specifically your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12267)|
| 3:24:28| Chattanooga's upgraded electronics two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12268)|
| 3:24:31| And what they've been able to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| keep their prices stable on their internet side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| but they continue to give more speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12276)|
| 3:24:38| When they very first started out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12278)|
| 3:24:39| the prices that they now pay, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| it's for their 300 megabyte plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| was where they started out with like a 25 or 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12283)|
| 3:24:46| And I think they're going through an electronic upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12286)|
| 3:24:48| right now, and they want to be able to offer everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| a gig very similar to what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| So if your pro forma works out and we have a 35% take rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12292)|
| 3:24:55| 10 years from now, we need to update the fiber network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| as a whole, you would not think that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12298)|
| 3:25:03| would need to increase rates across the board in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12303)|
| 3:25:06| to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12306)|
| 3:25:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12306)|
| 3:25:08| We're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12308)|
| 3:25:13| This may be obvious to some of us who've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| read thousands of these pages and understood this in depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| but what is the impact to the city's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| What cash outlay is there to the city's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12321)|
| 3:25:24| now or in the foreseeable future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12324)|
| 3:25:26| Maybe Deputy Gill, you can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12326)|
| 3:25:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12331)|
| 3:25:32| So we have calculated with the help of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12332)|
| 3:25:35| As you know, Council Member, we track all of our utility bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12335)|
| 3:25:39| for our sustainability efforts very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| so we know what we're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12341)|
| 3:25:43| One of the, again, realities that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12343)|
| 3:25:47| is that there were rate increases coming already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| and those would have happened, as KUB's described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12349)|
| 3:25:52| no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12352)|
| 3:25:53| So when we adjust for truly the net,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12353)|
| 3:25:56| the net impact for electricity rate increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12356)|
| 3:26:02| the things that are utility bills to be expected to go up just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12362)|
| 3:26:05| for this rate alone, we see a delta at any given year ranging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12365)|
| 3:26:11| from about $173,000 to $478,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12371)|
| 3:26:15| I believe I added that up at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| It was roughly $4.2 million over the 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12377)|
| 3:26:21| That said, we also have to remember, Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12381)|
| 3:26:24| that KUB is obligated to pay us payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12384)|
| 3:26:28| That's a state law that they have to pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12388)|
| 3:26:31| Those pilot payments every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12391)|
| 3:26:34| And again, because of that increased improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12394)|
| 3:26:38| to the system, we are expecting to see upwards of $4.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12398)|
| 3:26:45| in new pilot revenue coming in attributable specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12405)|
| 3:26:49| to that incremental increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| And so when you add that up, it comes close to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12411)|
| 3:26:55| $42 million coming into the city over a 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12415)|
| 3:27:00| So again, we do expect to see our electric bills be impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12420)|
| 3:27:05| but it is dwarfed significantly by the new revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12425)|
| 3:27:09| that KUB will be providing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| as a local government entity for their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12431)|
| 3:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12434)|
| 3:27:14| So similar to KUB, we should be able to utilize those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12434)|
| 3:27:18| to have more efficient services for taxpayers in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12438)|
| 3:27:23| As a result of that new revenue, we can build new things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| staff new folks in the city, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| I think that, yes, any time that we have new revenue coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| it's an opportunity that is afforded to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12453)|
| 3:27:34| to say how do we best utilize those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| to advance the needs of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| And as Susan knows, you know, there's obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12458)|
| 3:27:41| that's a very small percentage of our total budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12461)|
| 3:27:44| that we'd be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12464)|
| 3:27:44| But again, it is meaningful when we think about the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12464)|
| 3:27:47| to have a new revenue source coming in to provide services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12467)|
| 3:27:50| of any number of good things that we want to do for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12470)|
| 3:27:55| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12475)|
| 3:27:56| Credit unions and banks have different regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12476)|
| 3:27:58| that they have to follow, but they both have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12478)|
| 3:28:00| to follow regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12480)|
| 3:28:01| And so to the extent we make sure either legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12481)|
| 3:28:06| or contractually that there's fair competition in the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12486)|
| 3:28:08| of KUB, we're to provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| I think Mr. Mackey raised some good concerns related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| to fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| I think one of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12495)|
| 3:28:17| that I think he shared was related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| to cross-marketing practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12499)|
| 3:28:24| Can you talk about what's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12504)|
| 3:28:29| Cross-marketing, can you explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| Yeah, I think Mr. Mackey had said that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12511)|
| 3:28:35| of the unfair elements of this competition is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12515)|
| 3:28:38| that you have existing customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12518)|
| 3:28:39| that you can cross-sell the service to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| So can you explain your perspective on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12521)|
| 3:28:45| At the end of the day, you know, if somebody calls us and asks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12525)|
| 3:28:48| about that, then as long as each division pays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12528)|
| 3:28:53| for its fair share of the services provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12533)|
| 3:28:57| we hear a lot about cross-subsidization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12537)|
| 3:28:58| I haven't heard cross-marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12538)|
| 3:28:59| so that's the reason I was asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| This is a fifth utility like our other four divisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12541)|
| 3:29:04| that has to stand alone and pay for its fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12544)|
| 3:29:07| So a simple, I'm trying to think of a good example of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| if a customer calls into our call center and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| hi, I'm new to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12552)|
| 3:29:13| I need to start an electric service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| And we say, you know, have you signed up for fiber service yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12555)|
| 3:29:19| Would you be interested in hearing about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| As long as that call rep is being paid for by a fair share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| of both the electric and fiber divisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12564)|
| 3:29:27| that's what Chattanooga and other municipals do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12567)|
| 3:29:30| Don't know that it's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| I don't know whether it's fair or unfair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| however we perceive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12574)|
| 3:29:36| But the cross-subsidization argument kind of comes in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| at that particular point from some folks at Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12579)|
| 3:29:40| Okay, and related to fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12580)|
| 3:29:42| I think Mr. Mackey raised a good concern as well in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12582)|
| 3:29:45| of access to utility poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12585)|
| 3:29:46| I mean, by best practice or general business practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12586)|
| 3:29:50| you don't delight in unfair practices or have any need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12590)|
| 3:29:55| to keep those folks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12595)|
| 3:29:55| But are you legally obligated or contractually restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12595)|
| 3:30:00| from doing that if there was ill intent to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12600)|
| 3:30:07| I don't know of anything that, you know, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| I don't know the answer to that question exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| We do make our facilities available to our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12611)|
| 3:30:15| to the providers in Knoxville and always have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| and we always will continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12617)|
| 3:30:18| It's part of our contracts we have with those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| And so, therefore, I just can't imagine any situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| where we would not allow that and we never have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| and never will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12625)|
| 3:30:26| Other utilities across the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12626)|
| 3:30:28| that do this offer their poles to their customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12628)|
| 3:30:31| I would think if that was something we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| if that was done improperly, we'd be held accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| for that because we are a public utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| I think you mentioned that you are contractually bound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| to allow access to the providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| I think the FCC as a municipal provider provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12644)|
| 3:30:47| for some of that guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12647)|
| 3:30:48| I think TVA does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12648)|
| 3:30:50| We probably want to talk to our legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12650)|
| 3:30:52| to get you cert, you know, as far as what exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| mandates us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12654)|
| 3:30:56| It's never something we've had to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12656)|
| 3:30:58| and wouldn't intend to have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12658)|
| 3:31:00| in that particular regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12660)|
| 3:31:02| But at the end of the day, I think we're mandated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12662)|
| 3:31:06| to do so and we'll be glad to get the actual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12666)|
| 3:31:09| if there is a cert or provision in contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| But what we do know is how we've operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| with our providers, which is a local agreement with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12673)|
| 3:31:16| and historically we've been able to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12676)|
| 3:31:19| those without issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12679)|
| 3:31:20| Okay, I'd like to see that contractual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12680)|
| 3:31:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12683)|
| 3:31:23| Councilman Smith, if I can jump in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12683)|
| 3:31:26| So there was also a point brought up about right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12686)|
| 3:31:29| and as you know, this body and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12689)|
| 3:31:32| have control over the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12692)|
| 3:31:33| and again, the permit processes would be the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12693)|
| 3:31:36| but specifically with regard to any utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| there is FCC regulations that does prohibit us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12699)|
| 3:31:43| from prohibiting utility access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| So we can work with utilities to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12705)|
| 3:31:48| here's what we require when accessing a right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12708)|
| 3:31:49| but we can't just put a cart blank, you can't access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12709)|
| 3:31:52| I will also reference the point that part of the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12712)|
| 3:31:55| around the use of the poles is that it does not benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| our community as you all know in your districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| when you have a proliferation of poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12719)|
| 3:32:01| because every single provider has to put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12721)|
| 3:32:03| their own infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12723)|
| 3:32:04| So it is of our benefit again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12724)|
| 3:32:07| and I think this is where the partnership with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12727)|
| 3:32:08| and their role as a public entity accountable to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12728)|
| 3:32:13| as citizens becomes very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| because again, there's a shared benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12735)|
| 3:32:17| when we can think about joint use of the existing assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12737)|
| 3:32:20| or just again, putting as much as you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12740)|
| 3:32:22| onto a single pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12742)|
| 3:32:23| I think Mr. Doyle mentioned getting things in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12743)|
| 3:32:27| so I'd like to see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12747)|
| 3:32:28| whatever contractual requirement there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12748)|
| 3:32:31| And I'll also mention about fairness too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12751)|
| 3:32:33| in that nearly $30 million that FIBER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| will be paying Electric just in the effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12755)|
| 3:32:38| to be sure that they're paying their fair share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12758)|
| 3:32:40| they pay, FIBER division pays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12760)|
| 3:32:42| even though they're not attaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12762)|
| 3:32:43| they pay for as if they were an attacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12763)|
| 3:32:46| to pay for the depreciation on the poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12766)|
| 3:32:48| and other maintenance on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12768)|
| 3:32:49| even beyond just that of the FIBER itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| So again, we tried to build a model in the business plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| that FIBER pays its fair share over the long haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| Just wanted to mention that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12777)|
| 3:33:00| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12780)|
| 3:33:01| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12783)|
| 3:33:04| So one and two, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12784)|
| 3:33:07| So competitive markets are good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12787)|
| 3:33:09| but we do have to be very cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| that they're not at the expense of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| who are already cost burdened by utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| So I was glad that my colleague asked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12795)|
| 3:33:19| what does that dollar amount breakdown look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12799)|
| 3:33:23| for everyone who's watching and listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| But we also talked about future stabilization in rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12805)|
| 3:33:31| So let's say that that seven to 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12811)|
| 3:33:33| none of us are still gonna be sitting around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12813)|
| 3:33:36| in seven to 10 years, more than likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12816)|
| 3:33:39| And so you talked about there's potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12819)|
| 3:33:42| no rate increases that will happen at that particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12822)|
| 3:33:46| And so I think that that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12826)|
| 3:33:47| that I'd like for us to see in writing as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12827)|
| 3:33:51| that that is the projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12831)|
| 3:33:54| Because again, if none of us are sitting on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12834)|
| 3:33:56| at that particular time, I would like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| to be in the record in some type of written form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12838)|
| 3:34:02| Also, you talked about the Tennessee American Rescue Funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12842)|
| 3:34:07| that those monies are gonna be applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| that would go toward the infrastructure cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12849)|
| 3:34:13| In the event that you were to be awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| more than you anticipate, would that offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12855)|
| 3:34:20| at any juncture the potential rate increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12860)|
| 3:34:24| of the 3% even at any point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12864)|
| 3:34:28| Yes, I think it would depend upon the magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12868)|
| 3:34:30| of what we receive, but ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12870)|
| 3:34:33| any dollars that we get, whether it's $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12873)|
| 3:34:37| or $10 million, that ultimately is something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12877)|
| 3:34:41| our cost, that reimburses our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12881)|
| 3:34:44| It doesn't have to be paid by our rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12884)|
| 3:34:46| I guess that's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12886)|
| 3:34:48| So every dollar that we get, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12888)|
| 3:34:50| will be a dollar that our customers are saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12890)|
| 3:34:54| as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12894)|
| 3:34:55| So, and a specific answer to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12895)|
| 3:34:58| yes, if there was a large magnitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12898)|
| 3:35:00| we might be able to reduce that 3% rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12900)|
| 3:35:05| Just depends upon the magnitude of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12905)|
| 3:35:06| the timing of it, and other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12906)|
| 3:35:09| Is it possible that that could actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| that verbiage could actually be included as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12911)|
| 3:35:14| That dependent on if the amount of the grant dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12914)|
| 3:35:19| comes in significantly over what you anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12919)|
| 3:35:22| that that would be a consideration for the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12922)|
| 3:35:26| Oh, yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12926)|
| 3:35:27| Yeah, yeah, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| And then, also, my last comment is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12929)|
| 3:35:32| you talked about, a little bit about the framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12932)|
| 3:35:36| was there around the low-income program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12936)|
| 3:35:40| what that would look like, and I would like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12940)|
| 3:35:44| if the KUB Community Advisory Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12944)|
| 3:35:46| would be engaged in that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12946)|
| 3:35:48| to help look at, along with your board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12948)|
| 3:35:51| and along with city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| what the criteria would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| That's a great, yes, great suggestion, and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12957)|
| 3:35:58| And what I will say is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12958)|
| 3:36:02| out of controversy comes good things a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12962)|
| 3:36:04| You know, from my experience, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12964)|
| 3:36:08| when we were having conversations around KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12968)|
| 3:36:10| and I think it was SACE last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12970)|
| 3:36:13| the Community Advisory Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12973)|
| 3:36:15| was a result of those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| and so I just wanna encourage you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| to continue to tap into that advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12979)|
| 3:36:22| as you move forward, especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12982)|
| 3:36:25| that this has passed, and we have to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12985)|
| 3:36:28| of course, what is best for our low-income residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12988)|
| 3:36:31| that are energy cost burdened already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12991)|
| 3:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12993)|
| 3:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12995)|
| 3:36:38| Council, well, Council Member Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=12998)|
| 3:36:40| hasn't spoken yet, do you wanna go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13000)|
| 3:36:42| Well, I think my colleagues have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13002)|
| 3:36:43| Okay, Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13003)|
| 3:36:45| and then Roger, and then Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13005)|
| 3:36:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| Um, I already had one question answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13011)|
| 3:36:55| about the pilot payment, and I appreciate that answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13015)|
| 3:36:59| because I've been wanting to know the projected figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13019)|
| 3:37:05| and I have a few questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13025)|
| 3:37:06| but I did wanna make a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| because I am a strong supporter of public broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13027)|
| 3:37:12| and have been in support of seeing the public broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13032)|
| 3:37:16| and not so for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13036)|
| 3:37:19| However, once we start a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| I do feel most comfortable as an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13041)|
| 3:37:25| to come to the table with all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13045)|
| 3:37:28| in front of me before I vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13048)|
| 3:37:30| and approve something from moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| So for me, that means we have gone quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13052)|
| 3:37:37| If I'm arriving today without all of the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13057)|
| 3:37:40| and I've worked really hard to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13060)|
| 3:37:42| all the information we've talked over weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13062)|
| 3:37:45| but I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13065)|
| 3:37:47| I do think that it's understandable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13067)|
| 3:37:51| why many individuals have additional questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13071)|
| 3:37:54| about what is being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13074)|
| 3:37:59| One thing I wanted to ask about are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13079)|
| 3:38:06| opportunities for businesses under this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13086)|
| 3:38:11| because we have heard a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13091)|
| 3:38:14| lift zones for businesses and non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13094)|
| 3:38:19| that Comcast provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| And I have heard some concerns in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| from individuals who run transitional homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13104)|
| 3:38:28| group homes, other spaces like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13108)|
| 3:38:31| And of course, the low-income program is not developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13111)|
| 3:38:36| but is there a plan for those members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13116)|
| 3:38:42| who are worried about the increase to their KUV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| So I appreciate we did have this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13126)|
| 3:38:48| and you actually sent me an example of one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13128)|
| 3:38:51| So I just really quickly looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| That is a home, a residential home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13133)|
| 3:38:56| and they have received funds this last year, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13136)|
| 3:38:59| to help pay their KUV bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13139)|
| 3:39:00| That program will still, we'll still have programs like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13140)|
| 3:39:03| to help those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| And so as they become eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| and those funds are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13147)|
| 3:39:08| we would encourage those folks to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13148)|
| 3:39:10| So I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13150)|
| 3:39:12| We don't have them marked as a separate group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13152)|
| 3:39:14| but there are a lot of times homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13154)|
| 3:39:15| that take in kids temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13155)|
| 3:39:18| For some period of time, it could be a large amount of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13158)|
| 3:39:20| or a small amount of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13160)|
| 3:39:21| And so they, but they have been eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13161)|
| 3:39:24| under the current plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13164)|
| 3:39:25| Tiffany, I can speak to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| She looked into that for me, our chief customer officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13167)|
| 3:39:30| And the one you sent me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13170)|
| 3:39:32| we did have assistance this last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13172)|
| 3:39:34| to help them pay their utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13174)|
| 3:39:36| So the proposal is to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13176)|
| 3:39:42| these households as a part of the low-income plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13182)|
| 3:39:45| but they would not be treated any separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| than any individual who applied for assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13187)|
| 3:39:51| Our current thought on the low-income internet plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13191)|
| 3:39:54| again, is modeled after Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13194)|
| 3:39:56| which right now, as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13196)|
| 3:39:57| would focus predominantly on kids per school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13197)|
| 3:40:02| And so again, a lot of the discussion about the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13202)|
| 3:40:05| beyond that would be the notion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13205)|
| 3:40:08| like we've said, Chattanooga's done free or reduced lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13208)|
| 3:40:10| but we received a lot of good feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13210)|
| 3:40:12| that that may not be the best criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13212)|
| 3:40:14| and that we could change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13214)|
| 3:40:16| To the extent we expand it beyond kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13216)|
| 3:40:18| really is dependent upon funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13218)|
| 3:40:20| and how much could fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13220)|
| 3:40:21| So current initial, we have estimates whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13221)|
| 3:40:24| you know, we kind of know ballpark of the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13224)|
| 3:40:27| that are on free or reduced lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13227)|
| 3:40:28| We assume that on most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13228)|
| 3:40:30| there's 1.9 kids in a home kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13230)|
| 3:40:33| And we try to say, okay, if 25% of that population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| subscribed at 50%, what about 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13235)|
| 3:40:38| Well, there's a dollar figure there that has to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13238)|
| 3:40:41| And so ultimately, that's where we'll have to hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| that sweet spot of trying to serve the most people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13243)|
| 3:40:46| but at the same point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13246)|
| 3:40:47| being true to our commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| that we're gonna serve those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13249)|
| 3:40:51| It's not an inexpensive proposition to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13251)|
| 3:40:53| in that particular regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13253)|
| 3:40:54| because the financial model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13254)|
| 3:40:57| we would charge, again, an equivalent rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13257)|
| 3:41:01| for a paying customer as well, too, inside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13261)|
| 3:41:05| So, and also, I'm realizing I am mixing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| two different ideas in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13267)|
| 3:41:09| I'm gonna straighten it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13269)|
| 3:41:10| So sticking with the low-income broadband plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13270)|
| 3:41:16| and this may be a question for later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13276)|
| 3:41:18| but it helps me understand this business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13278)|
| 3:41:20| Would the anticipation be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13280)|
| 3:41:25| for the city to develop this low-income plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13285)|
| 3:41:31| we would essentially pull from the pilot payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13291)|
| 3:41:37| and subsidize these households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13297)|
| 3:41:41| who are able to participate in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| And would it be at the same rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| that other individuals are being charged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| or would it be at a reduced rate in charge to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| It would be the same rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13309)|
| 3:41:52| I think I can jump in on your first point there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13312)|
| 3:41:54| and I think what, again, the agreement spells out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13314)|
| 3:41:56| is that we would continue to work with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13316)|
| 3:41:59| and that there would be, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13319)|
| 3:42:01| as part of our annual budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| that there would be a commitment to work with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13323)|
| 3:42:05| figure out what the needs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13325)|
| 3:42:06| figure out what the other resources on the table are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13326)|
| 3:42:09| because, again, when we look at what we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| just really in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| huge amounts of federal resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| huge amounts of philanthropic resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| You know, where are those opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13337)|
| 3:42:18| where KUB can leverage outside partners as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13338)|
| 3:42:22| but that we would then come to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13342)|
| 3:42:24| through our budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13344)|
| 3:42:25| with an appropriate amount of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| that we felt met the need, filled the gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13347)|
| 3:42:31| to the best that we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| knowing that, again, we're not specifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13353)|
| 3:42:36| that it would be linked to any particular revenue source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13356)|
| 3:42:39| but rather that there'd be that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| to do this on an annual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| and understand what the needs of the program are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| relative to our budgetary ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13365)|
| 3:42:49| Thank you, and I'll have more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| about the low-income program, so I will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13371)|
| 3:42:55| But one of the other issues that we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13375)|
| 3:42:58| when we met were, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13378)|
| 3:43:03| milestones that KUB might put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13383)|
| 3:43:07| as it starts to implement the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13387)|
| 3:43:09| and determine whether things are going along as projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13389)|
| 3:43:14| and how you might adjust according to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13394)|
| 3:43:17| Can you share a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13397)|
| 3:43:18| Yeah, so, you know, if we approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13398)|
| 3:43:21| we will begin the process of setting up that division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13401)|
| 3:43:24| We will be watching it very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13404)|
| 3:43:26| and making sure we do hit those milestones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13406)|
| 3:43:29| and Jamie, you can expand on that a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| but we won't go in this willy-nilly and eyes closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13411)|
| 3:43:34| It'll be a constant checking in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13414)|
| 3:43:36| checking what's the service we're providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| are we getting people to hook up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| are we hitting metrics, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13420)|
| 3:43:42| Our board will be asking us constantly for that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13422)|
| 3:43:44| so we'll provide it to whoever wants it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13424)|
| 3:43:46| because, once again, we are open records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13426)|
| 3:43:49| And so we will know early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13429)|
| 3:43:51| and if we see something that's not going as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| we'll put more effort into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13433)|
| 3:43:54| we'll figure out why that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13434)|
| 3:43:56| I personally think it's gonna go pretty successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13436)|
| 3:43:59| based on our peers across the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13439)|
| 3:44:00| who have been successful in this model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13440)|
| 3:44:02| and we learned a lot from those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13442)|
| 3:44:03| We're not first to this type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| We'll be actually one of the back end of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13445)|
| 3:44:09| And so we will have those things in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| constantly monitoring, looking at what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13451)|
| 3:44:13| what's happening in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| That's what we should be held to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13455)|
| 3:44:20| And then also on the issue that was brought up earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13460)|
| 3:44:25| and please forgive me if I repeat anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13465)|
| 3:44:28| that was stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13468)|
| 3:44:29| because I couldn't hear clearly the full conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| regarding permits and access to coal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13471)|
| 3:44:36| But it did concern me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13476)|
| 3:44:38| and please, Mr. Mackey, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13478)|
| 3:44:41| but it did concern me when I spoke with Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| and they stated they haven't been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13484)|
| 3:44:46| to get a permit since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13486)|
| 3:44:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13488)|
| 3:44:49| And so I think it's also important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13489)|
| 3:44:53| as we're considering public broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13493)|
| 3:44:57| that it's not just about ensuring access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13497)|
| 3:45:03| but ensuring that there's no delay in access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13503)|
| 3:45:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13506)|
| 3:45:07| Was that just discussed a few minutes ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13507)|
| 3:45:09| Can you help me understand why there's been such a delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13509)|
| 3:45:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13513)|
| 3:45:16| The IUA that we talked about earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13516)|
| 3:45:18| is what governs that relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13518)|
| 3:45:20| and we've been trying to work together with Comcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13520)|
| 3:45:23| to get that reforged, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| and so that contract's been in expiration since 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13525)|
| 3:45:29| is the real reason there in that particular regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13529)|
| 3:45:33| And do you have a timeline for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13533)|
| 3:45:36| We stand ready to be at the table, and have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13536)|
| 3:45:40| Don't know why things haven't progressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13540)|
